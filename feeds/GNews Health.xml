			&lt;p&gt;A drug widely used to treat nerve pain and epilepsy has been linked with an increase in cases of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Arizona State University, and the MetroHealth Medical Center in the US crunched the numbers on 26,416 records of patients with chronic &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-exercise-is-an-overlooked-solution-to-lower-back-pain"&gt;lower back pain&lt;/a&gt;, looking at the relationship between prescriptions for the anticonvulsant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"&gt;gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; and dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having six or more gabapentin prescriptions was linked to a significant increase in dementia risk and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), the data showed: those in that group were 29 percent and 85 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and MCI respectively, within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase was higher among patients aged between 35 and 49, and also rose with the number of prescriptions given, the researchers found. Though the study can't establish a cause for the increase, physicians are encouraged to keep a close eye on patients taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Physicians should monitor cognitive outcomes in patients prescribed gabapentin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold under brand names including Neurontin, gabapentin has proved to be less addictive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/opioids-watched-in-real-time-as-they-work-deep-inside-the-brain"&gt;than opioids&lt;/a&gt;, making it more likely to be prescribed in recent years. The drug does have some known side effects though, including extreme moods and allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have examined associations between gabapentin and dementia, but previous studies &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.031"&gt;haven't agreed&lt;/a&gt; on whether or not concerns are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg" alt="Gabapentin tablets" class="wp-image-167804 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabapentin is a commonly prescribed medication for pain relief and epilepsy.

A study published in 1997 found no link between gabapentin and cognitive decline in people with epilepsy, so it's important to continue to widen the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results could suggest unique mechanisms among patients with the type of backpain that leads to a gabapentin prescription that also increases their risk of dementia, like a certain type of location of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gabapentin works by dampening some of the brain's key communication channels, in order to provide relief from pain or make seizures less likely. So the worry is that it could also be damaging links between neurons in ways that might lead to dementia – a concern backed up by this latest study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a challenging condition to study with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-risk-can-be-cut-by-45-if-together-we-do-these-14-things"&gt;so many potential factors&lt;/a&gt; to account for, but each study gets us closer to the full picture of how the brain breaks down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current study promotes further research to delineate whether gabapentin plays a causal role in the development of dementia and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s true that you’re not alone if you’re struggling with chronic exhaustion, like &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/hershey/story/medical-minute-why-am-i-always-so-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;physical exhaustion, Dr. Katelynn Sheaffer&lt;/a&gt; suggests, there is a diverse range of culprits that could be keeping you in this unhealthy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From sleep patterns to eating habits and even screen-time usage, several things keep people feeling tired in their daily lives, no matter what’s going on in their routines. Many of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired are representative of these causes, so if you’re struggling, consider addressing these random and unsuspecting items first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. A phone charger right next to the bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/things-youll-always-find-in-the-home-of-someone-constantly-tired-phone-charger.png" alt="Man with a phone charger on his nightstand sitting in the dark." title="phone charger nightstand things you'll always find in the home of someone who's constantly tired " class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gorodenkoff | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charger on the nightstand, and more specifically, constant access to their phone right from bed, is one of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are chronically exhausted and fatigued throughout the day almost always wake up that way. Their sleep patterns aren’t great; they’re not getting enough sleep, and they wake up feeling drained and anxious. So, what’s the primary motivator behind this lack of quality and duration of sleep? Experts believe it’s their phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7010281/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study from PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, scrolling on your phone before bed every night keeps your brain in a state of constant arousal and stress, making it harder to fall asleep and more challenging to wake up feeling rested. Of course, it’s not always convenient to set an alarm on your phone and put it away from your bed, but doing so can forcefully cultivate time — both in the morning and at night — for your brain to settle without added pressure from a phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/master-bedtime-habits-remain-happy-into-old-age"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Say If You Can Master These 12 Pre-Bedtime Habits, You'll Remain Happy Into Your 80s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Water bottles next to a bed are a common sight in the homes of people who are constantly tired, as they often drink so much water that they wake up at night and disrupt their sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem unsuspecting, but the more intentional you are with food and water consumption before bed, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/wild-sleep-facts-explain-why-youre-still-tired-no-matter-what"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Wild Sleep Facts That Explain Why You’re Still Tired No Matter What&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Not only do warmer temperatures when we’re trying to sleep make it harder to comfortably fall asleep, but they also often disrupt our body’s cooling mechanisms that allow us to stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why a warm bedroom or a thermostat set about 70 degrees Fahrenheit are some of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired. They’re not only getting bad quality sleep — being woken up and disrupted every hour — they’re also not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The One Habit Well-Rested People Use To Fall Asleep In Minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

If we’re not waking up naturally from light or sounds in the morning, it may be harder to truly wake up feeling refreshed and energized simply from the sound of an abrupt alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired, because rather than changing their habits, work-life boundaries, or diets, they instead opt for “quick fixes” that keep them stuck in a cycle of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-burned-out-not-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Signs You're Burned Out, Not Lazy — According To Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

It’s not only one of the things you’ll almost always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired, but a responsibility that drains people in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, being a parent is often a gift and a fulfilling experience, but there’s no denying it takes up a lot of emotional energy, time, physical activity, and self-assuredness to excel at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/parenting-mistakes-guilty-making-probably-are-too"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Parenting Mistakes I'm Guilty Of Making — And You Probably Are, Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

Packed with protein, essential vitamins, and minerals, eggs are a nutritional powerhouse, but do they harm your heart? French biochemist Jessie Inchauspé, author of the bestselling books Glucose Revolution and The Glucose Goddess Method, has weighed in on whether eggs harm the heart. Inchauspé, who is known for her evidence-based approach to nutrition, has detailed the real impact of eggs on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat 3 to 4 eggs a day... and I know what you're going to say: ‘Aren't eggs bad for your heart?’ So let's set the record straight: eggs are amazing!” she said, in a video shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutritious. An egg contains 78 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single large boiled egg contains: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A: 8% of the DV (daily value)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folate: 6% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5): 14% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B12: 23% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 20% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 7% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium: 28% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, calcium, and zinc&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Are eggs bad for the heart? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to associate eggs with heart disease due to their cholesterol content. According to the biochemist, the cholesterol in eggs does not pose a significant risk to cardiovascular health. “Cholesterol in eggs is not damaging,” she &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLh3H8eIQxm/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adding that one does not have to be worried about eating eggs. “I have eggs every single day. There doesn't need to be a limit on how many eggs you consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inchauspé notes that the culprit behind heart disease is not the eggs, but the glucose dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So there are a few different hypotheses in the world of heart disease, but now things are starting to get a bit clearer. It's a two-factor approach. The first factor for heart disease is small, dense LDL particles of cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second factor for heart disease, inflammation and oxidation of particles in your bloodstream,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Eating an egg a day: Is it good or bad for your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What can be done &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/how-many-eggs-should-you-eat-per-day-latest-research-has-surprising-answers/articleshow/122331002.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have been looked upon with doubt due to their cholesterol content. However, now the focus has shifted to managing blood sugar and reducing inflammation rather than avoiding cholesterol-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce heart disease risk, the scientist recommends cutting back on sugar intake. “So, how do we avoid having unhealthy fats in our blood, and how do we avoid oxidation? The first thing we need to do is reduce sugar because sugar and high insulin, and high glucose levels, and fructose in the body will make both of those things worse. It will prompt your liver to produce small particle LDL, and it'll oxidize particles in your bloodstream,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxPOGk0bGMtMjJQWE81bnk0VndRQ1R5TXg2cjVBLTZVUkFCbHJMaThkWTJMNjkwakNieUhpeXhPMXlnT0dhTFdSbDZudW5hd2NTd3NmS0Qxb3MwbzUyNXJCMndsbmRvcnBURHQzRkhxaVJVSllUTUp2M0FWbnFLYVBKYm5mR2MzR2JtUlhvTDgtYk81YnphN3I4WTZIdzBzaFNFX3RubVlXeWNSdWhmOFhmRUZPNFlHTnBDa1BqSFh0cFh0aTZHYUFSazFaalo3U3huNlQxeDZIZVh5OHd0UXlSanpFeG9rQmxQRW9QdjhDY2ZxWS1EYTd0SlNnWmo1NnE2T3c</guid></item><item><title>在科学家使用三个人的DNA来避免遗传疾病之后，在英国出生的健康婴儿- CNN | Healthy babies born in Britain after scientists used DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBNMHg1dExla191NUN0Zi1HX2pLclp3YUNaSnJvMVoxNzJIbURmQkZ1ak5pdlFlWDJpRW13ckJmUDBMclNXWWpTQXhvQWVyOHp5NnAzenlXU2U3NlpkSHJ5bWJqaEZnaEhKZWlHTTBBem5NMzcwdTA40gF8QVVfeXFMUENSeG0tSUNkZi1kb0pqTDBzUVc1SWFDS3lUNlVJZFlqdERCd09WOXlXakJ2YXEzei02dVlndUhWQmJlY1BEeWw2d0V6YkV4LWhVemZYeGRLVERDLV96RENsVlV2OS1mWU9rYU52YVZqZnBnUUM4emd0QXRFdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00063b6nj1ud8a7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it’s that genetic material — some inherited from mom, some from dad — that makes us who we are. But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00073b6nbwmlg8dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00083b6nzv1d63kp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58" target="_blank"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00093b6n0za4hust@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000a3b6n0nhj9gly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-9f87d8bbf8cb46b5b811f984ac7bba4e" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3" target="_blank"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000b3b6nokpt794d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000c3b6nxgwt5h98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000d3b6nqgcil7gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work “a triumph of scientific innovation,” and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000e3b6nrtqx45m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000f3b6ne3c78ayi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000g3b6n0qqhgkdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000h3b6n1d2n5b4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000i3b6njfcoaipd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000j3b6npe34y2ff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000k3b6ne84bah9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000l3b6nddz7r2e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000m3b6nw6km0s1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000n3b6nlg16vr8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The fertility regulator granted the first licence in 2017 to a fertility clinic at Newcastle University where doctors pioneered the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The four boys and four girls, including one set of identical twins, were born to seven women and have no signs of the mitochondrial diseases they were at risk of inheriting. One further pregnancy is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Doug Turnbull, who was part of the team that spent more than two decades developing the procedure, said the healthy births were reassuring for researchers and the families affected. “You are inevitably thinking it’s great for the patients and that is a relief,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Mary Herbert, another senior member of the team, said to have eight healthy babies from the procedure was “rewarding for all of us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vast majority of a human’s 20,000 genes are curled up in the nucleus of nearly every cell in the body. But the fluid surrounding the nucleus contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria that carry their own set of 37 genes. Mutations in these genes can impair or completely disable mitochondria with catastrophic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People inherit all their mitochondria from their biological mother. Mutations in the tiny battery-like structures can affect all the children a woman has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first symptoms of mitochondrial disease tend to appear in early childhood as energy-hungry organs such as the brain, heart and muscles start to fail. Many affected children have developmental delays, require wheelchairs and die young. About one in 5,000 newborns are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondrial donation treatment, or MDT, aims to prevent children from inheriting mutated mitochondria. The procedure involves fertilising the mother’s egg with the father’s sperm and then transferring the genetic material from the nucleus into a fertilised healthy donor egg that has had its own nucleus removed. This creates a fertilised egg with a full set of chromosomes from the parents, but healthy mitochondria from the donor. The egg is then implanted into the womb to establish a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"How mitochondrial donation therapy works","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="How mitochondrial donation therapy works" data-testid="interactive-element-How%20mitochondrial%20donation%20therapy%20works" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;How mitochondrial donation therapy works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first eight babies born to the procedure are described in &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415539" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503658" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. All eight were healthy at birth. One child developed a urinary infection that was treated, and another developed muscle jerks that resolved on their own. A third child developed high blood fat and a disturbance in their heart rhythm, which was also treated. The condition is thought to be related to a medical issue the mother had in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic tests showed that the babies had no or low levels of mutant mitochondria, with some carried over from the mother during the procedure. While the levels are considered too low to cause disease, it suggests the procedure could still be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All the children are well and they’re continuing to meet their developmental milestones,” said Bobby McFarland, director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders at Newcastle hospitals NHS foundation trust. Five of the children are less than a year old, two are aged between one and two, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the other child is older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The mother of one of the girls said: “As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope – and then it gave us our baby … we’re overwhelmed with gratitude. Science gave us a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some women who carry the genetic disorders produce eggs with varying levels of faulty mitochondria. For them, a technique called pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) can be used to select eggs for IVF that have a very low chance of passing on a disease. Other women do not have this choice because all their eggs have high levels of mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Newcastle team said eight of 22 (36%) of women became pregnant after MDT and 16 of 39 (41%) of women became pregnant after PGT. It is unclear why the rates differed, but some mitochondrial mutations may have knock-on effects on fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Writing in an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2507753" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Robin Lovell-Badge, a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the long road to this point had “no doubt been frustrating to women at risk of having children with mtDNA disease”, but praised the scientists’ cautious approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVnVDdmJUOGpyT0ZHenY1dnVXdHZxU3I3bjdSWHJzYUxRcV9iNjk1YW5KU1YtT3NFMjZRQi16VmNqZGhTZkpuVG4xUWI2dnRZTmRaN2dNVVNXVi1YT2tuOG92WklZd2lzNUJTUHlTeHFRd2pubXRydVV2Um9IMTJjQ0RfZ1NDck1aWFVjQVlha2NBaGx3VU8zRE44ZXJhdkp4RS1ZekhaT2FIWnpvZ292dg</guid></item><item><title>波罗公园的镜头： 25年7月16日周-波罗公园24 | The Lens of Boro Park: Week 7/16/2025 - Boro Park 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9VUXpuV3ZaRnBNNjJkcXVtaUFHc2FreHdZMXFid2Z0R3lVOHlCX2Nja3hMazJSY0VHTWFGdWZsTkswX0V0ZzYzU0IwNG9iNnpFdTlNVXNlUmk4ZzE5T0hKeWhWYy13bUJhZEFKZFQzeHBzSVd6ZXpV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="popup-text"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to make Greek yogurt at home is simple with this easy recipe. Start by making homemade yogurt by heating milk, combining it with a little bit of already-cultured yogurt and letting it sit in a warm spot until the milk turns into yogurt. Making protein-rich Greek yogurt takes one step beyond regular yogurt: straining the yogurt to thicken it. You can add the leftover liquid—also known as whey—to smoothies, or you can use it in place of buttermilk in baking.
&lt;/p&gt;

Current US childhood vaccine coverage is 95%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies the team conducted in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/9/1111/1745278?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/2/285/5741633?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggested that the vaccines generate at least 30 years of immunity against the life-threatening infections, far beyond the current 10-year booster recommendations and previous recommendations for even more frequent boosters (eg, every 3 years in 1955). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, childhood vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria have achieved roughly 95% and 99.9% reductions in those diseases, similar to those of other routine pediatric vaccines such as measles (99.9%), mumps (97.6%), and rubella (99.9%), the researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed, as indicated by the incidence of disease falling to less than one case of tetanus per 10 million person-years and approximately one case of diphtheria per 1 billion person-years in the U.S. population," they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First author Mark Slifka, PhD, of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090984"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that childhood vaccination has ensured that diphtheria and tetanus are "incredibly rare" today. "In fact, you're 10 to 1,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be diagnosed with tetanus and diphtheria in the United States," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Closer alignment with WHO guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the United States, France recommends tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccines for adults. But the United Kingdom hasn't recommended them for anyone older than 14 since the 1950s, except for pregnant women or for those with tetanus-prone wounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the investigators found that the United Kingdom had a slightly lower rate of tetanus and diphtheria infection and that population immunity remained strong even through a 2022 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266723001755?pes=doc&amp;amp;utm_source=asm&amp;amp;getft_integrator=asm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 73 imported diphtheria cases among immigrants seeking asylum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Remarkably, despite this proportionally large influx of imported diphtheria cases, there was no evidence of transmission reported among other asylum seekers who arrived by other routes or among staff or health care workers," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors caution that adult boosters should still be considered for emergency use in cases involving susceptible wounds, pregnant women, travelers to areas endemic for diphtheria, and anyone who didn't complete the childhood vaccine series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population," the researchers wrote, adding that the move would more closely align US recommendations with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which haven't recommended adult boosters against tetanus or diphtheria since 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This scent is strong enough for a canine nose to detect with remarkable accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery could open the door to faster, cheaper, and entirely non‑invasive screening for a condition that currently lacks an early diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together &lt;a href="https://www.medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk/"&gt;Medical Detection Dogs&lt;/a&gt; in Milton Keynes with scientists from the Universities of &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/%C3%B9"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several months, the charity’s trainers conditioned two retriever-type dogs to recognize the odor that clings to sebum. This oily substance, which our skin naturally produces, changes when &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (PD) is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-training-dogs-to-detect-disease"&gt;Training dogs to detect disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, the canines encountered more than 200 gauze swabs. Some were taken from recently &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-dogs-can-alert-humans-to-valley-fever-disease/"&gt;diagnosed patients&lt;/a&gt;, others from volunteers with no neurological illness, and a few from people living with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pad was clipped to a stand. When a dog paused and pointed at a positive sample, the handler quietly clicked and offered a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final double-blind trial – where neither the dog handler nor the overseeing scientist knew which positions held a patient’s swab – the dogs showed sensitivity of up to 80 percent and specificity of up to 98 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were also able to detect Parkinson’s in swabs from people with multiple health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scent-of-parkinson-s"&gt;The scent of Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog noses are legendary, but &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; researchers turned to them for a very specific reason. Excess sebum and a change in body odor often precede the familiar motor symptoms – shaking, slowed movement, and rigid muscles – by years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scottish nurse named Joy Milne famously noticed a musky shift in her husband’s scent long before his diagnosis. Her observation inspired scientists to hunt for molecular fingerprints in skin oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A laboratory method based on mass‑spectrometry is inching forward, yet requires expensive instruments and trained personnel. Canines offer a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease,” said Claire Guest, CEO and Chief Scientific Officer at Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is currently no early test for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Timely diagnosis is key as subsequent treatment could slow down the progression of the disease, and reduce the intensity of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-detection-rates-that-rival-medical-tests"&gt;Detection rates that rival medical tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned neurologists can misclassify early Parkinson’s, and imaging scans or spinal fluid assays are costly. By contrast, the gold-coated sensitivity and specificity reported here exceed those of many existing point-of-care tests in medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying diagnostic biomarkers of PD – particularly those that may predict development or help diagnose disease earlier – is the subject of much ongoing research,” said lead author Nicola Rooney, an animal behavior specialist at the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooney noted that the dogs in the study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us develop a quick, noninvasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blinded-trials-confirm-the-results"&gt;Blinded trials confirm the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guard against subconscious cues or handler bias, the researchers also presented every testing line in reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer kept track of which sample sat where, and only after the dog’s choice did researchers learn whether to dispense a treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rigorous protocol mirrors clinical trial standards and boosts confidence that the animals relied on smell alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-help-build-smell-sensors"&gt;Dogs help build smell sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs will never replace neurologists, but the findings give chemists a shortlist of volatile molecules to capture with sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds to the growing body of evidence showing that simple, noninvasive skin swabs can be used to diagnose Parkinson’s disease,” said Perdita Barran, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Barran’s lab is already dissecting the swab chemistry; the canine results confirm those molecules belong on the diagnostic radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-and-other-neurological-diseases"&gt;Dogs and other neurological diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and dog trainers are beginning to explore how these animals can detect other neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, and even conditions like migraines or autism-related sensory episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Alzheimer’s, for example, people in early stages of the disease may emit subtle changes in body odor – things a human nose would never catch, but a dog’s nose picks up with ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scent cues could one day help in screening or early detection, well before symptoms become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also stories of dogs acting differently before their owners have a migraine or during MS flare-ups – becoming restless or unusually attentive – as if they sense something’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some families of children with autism even report that service dogs notice sensory overload before it escalates, helping calm things down before a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-the-science-of-scent"&gt;Expanding the science of scent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials aim to include people with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/"&gt;REM sleep behavior disorder&lt;/a&gt; – a risk state for Parkinson’s – to see whether dogs can spot the disease before a neurologist could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel chemical analyses will hunt for the exact compounds responsible for the odor. If those molecules prove consistent worldwide, engineers could embed them in low‑cost sensor chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now the message is hopeful: a straightforward skin swab carries hidden information about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-grounds-could-help-prevent-neurodegenerative-diseases/"&gt;neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, and a dog’s nose can read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge could accelerate the quest for a rapid, painless test. It would offer one more tool to bring Parkinson’s onto clinicians’ radar while there is still time to slow its march.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1877718X251342485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:46:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWlhtQ1c3UmMycFlFQVFEN3c0b2E3aFc4UzktS1dDc1RycEpzVk4zdlQzUkRMNHZzcXpISzRNelVHWlBocDFZZ0MyZHozcEFqN2dTU3dQRDU2SlZ2NW04WWs3TWFvVWZIa2NZZkw1YU5TNkJvNFZDLTFqRXZUTGt2ZmV1UTRFNUJuY2JZY1MyQmFjTWV3OUdWbE1qeWVyZEdjUVZMU1BldFozOHdnd1hV</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情能否阻止？ - WIRED | Can US Measles Outbreaks Be Stopped? - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE03akhoOE55VFlQb001ektpMURnSXR6R3FvWnhVTG1EdVh1ZmM5QmVDQXNnZk5mcUNMRnpBUnVlTEVwY3NCbnl5QzU3QVRlSnZxX3dxY19mdGJmcHFzdmd4ZXg1N1c3ZzhWaTRHZVM3T2NNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;The US is&lt;/span&gt; experiencing its worst &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;year for measles&lt;/a&gt; in over three decades, with more than 1,300 cases in 40 states as of July 16. Cases were almost as high in 2019, putting the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; at risk. Six years ago, health officials were able to stop the spread. But amid growing public backlash against vaccines, many of the tactics used then may not work now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles elimination means there has been no continuous transmission in a country for longer than 12 months. That almost happened in the 2019 outbreak, which largely affected Orthodox Jewish populations in New York City and some surrounding counties. In fall 2018, US travelers returning from Israel tested positive for measles. The disease quickly spread throughout close-knit communities, especially among children, due to low vaccination rates. While the statewide measles vaccination rate for school-age children was 98 percent the previous school year, vaccination coverage in schools in the outbreak area &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a4.htm"&gt;was only 77 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Because measles is highly contagious, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9197781/"&gt;95 percent vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; is needed to protect a community from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As a result, the majority of measles cases occurred in individuals 18 and under, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;nearly 86 percent&lt;/a&gt; of whom were known to be unvaccinated. Some of those people developed severe complications, including pneumonia, and nearly 8 percent were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The current surge is being fueled by an outbreak that started in an undervaccinated Mennonite community in West Texas. Cases have since spread to other Texas counties, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Two children in Texas with no underlying conditions and one adult in New Mexico have died this year as a result of measles. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There are definitely parallels. What we saw in New York was very much the result of years and years of spread of misinformation and disinformation around the safety of vaccines,” says Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source Coalition and previously a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped respond to the 2019 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cases eventually burned out in New York after a months-long effort that included both traditional public health approaches and policy changes at the local and state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“You need to take the first case seriously, because it's like kindling. You never know when that fire is just going to break out,” says Oxiris Barbot, the current president and CEO of the United Hospital Fund, who served as New York City’s health commissioner from 2018 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the disease spread, Barbot realized the city health department would need to go to the source of transmission, largely the Orthodox Jewish schools in affected neighborhoods. Working with school administrators, they reviewed vaccination records to identify unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. Following an exposure, those children were prohibited from attending school and childcare for 21 days, the incubation period for measles. Similar measures were taken in some counties outside the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It took a lot of staff time, a lot of leg work,” Barbot says. In one school, a contagious child led to more than 25 infections in other students and further spread outside the school. She says the health department was “heavily involved” in making sure schools were abiding by the quarantine measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE03akhoOE55VFlQb001ektpMURnSXR6R3FvWnhVTG1EdVh1ZmM5QmVDQXNnZk5mcUNMRnpBUnVlTEVwY3NCbnl5QzU3QVRlSnZxX3dxY19mdGJmcHFzdmd4ZXg1N1c3ZzhWaTRHZVM3T2NNQQ</guid></item><item><title>西南卫生区又有1例麻疹诊断标志着犹他州有10例病例- KSL新闻 | 1 more measles diagnosis in southwest health district marks 10 cases in Utah - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZU5RUXlxUmZXUHZRMXl1N0pTWUdsdjg2bzFqelpyT3BZejI3V2hqemVHMlJ1UkQzTDF2cGRZb2RIbEZQMldHaDg0S05ORXl2eVlrQ0JMdHB4NUJuc0VYbFpTQzNVa2Y0dWRaLV9CQnJVQUxKM0s4YWQ3ZlNKcUM1QXI1ZlMxaWlPYnc1R0ZKZFg3aFNDaU9fNzFhV25NZ2lfQUl4ZnZvdTgyVWhINUE4dDlLSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Another case of measles has been diagnosed in Utah, bringing this year's state total to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest case involves an unvaccinated person residing within the Southwest Utah Public Health District, according to a press release issued by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person reported self-isolating when they became sick, the release states, and the individual is already past the infectious period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 10 individuals who have been diagnosed with measles in Utah, at this point, are unvaccinated, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of them live in the Utah County Health Department. The health department announced on Friday that the measles virus had been &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/featured-news/measles-has-been-detected-in-provo-area-wastewater/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;detected in wastewater&lt;/a&gt; in Provo, indicating that at least one person in the area has contracted the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other three individuals who have confirmed infections are in the Southwest Utah Public Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it has not identified any new exposure locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/a&gt; typically appear about a week after exposure. Symptoms initially include a high fever, cough, runny nose, or red eyes and — after about four days — a rash will often appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department urges Utahns with symptoms to stay away from others and call their clinic or doctor before going out to prevent exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:26:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZU5RUXlxUmZXUHZRMXl1N0pTWUdsdjg2bzFqelpyT3BZejI3V2hqemVHMlJ1UkQzTDF2cGRZb2RIbEZQMldHaDg0S05ORXl2eVlrQ0JMdHB4NUJuc0VYbFpTQzNVa2Y0dWRaLV9CQnJVQUxKM0s4YWQ3ZlNKcUM1QXI1ZlMxaWlPYnc1R0ZKZFg3aFNDaU9fNzFhV25NZ2lfQUl4ZnZvdTgyVWhINUE4dDlLSQ</guid></item><item><title>婚姻建议：我妻子想多做爱。但我发现了一种更简单的方法来解决问题。- Slate Magazine | Marriage advice: My wife wants to have more sex.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6fg000o3b77kjcvhjta@published"&gt;I’m in a loving relationship with a woman I absolutely adore. We have sex two to three times a week, and it’s wonderful. But I’ve been using AI tools for masturbation nearly every day. It’s just so easy to explore wacky and fun scenarios (specifically in the fantasy and sci-fi genres) that I’ve found it dividing my attention from my girlfriend. I feel selfish and immature for not giving her all of my desire, and she’s told me she would like to have more sex. I really don’t know how to feel about this. Your perspective would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus, you’re probably hearing about AI &lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/06/ai-chatgpt-generator-grok-gemini-writing.html"&gt;ethical concerns &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/07/ai-college-cheating-gemini-chatgpt-students-policy.html"&gt;everywhere these days&lt;/a&gt; (and if you’ve somehow missed the discourse, you &lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/artificial-intelligence"&gt;can get up to speed on Slate&lt;/a&gt;). I think AI’s only going to become more integrated in our culture, whether we like it or not. So I’m accepting it as a given and treating it here like garden-variety porn, as you’re using it as a masturbation aid and the content is basically immaterial, or at least not nearly as important as its role as said aid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6lg000s3b77b9g7b881@published"&gt;You are allowed to have a sexual life of your own. Masturbation is healthy and a great way of keeping in touch (literally!) with your own body and sexuality. It becomes problematic when it causes distress and/or is subtractive from your lifestyle. If you had written to say that all of your sexual energy is taken up by your masturbation and porn viewing, and that you and your partner don’t like this, it would be a different issue. However, you are enjoying it and managing to have sex two or three times a week, which is above average. If you were preoccupied by said porn/unable to focus on your partner, again, it would be a different issue, but it seems as though you have struck a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6qr000t3b773eda0byr@published"&gt;If you think that less masturbation would yield more sex, and you actually want that, then by all means, cut back. You don’t have to abstain. Instead of nearly every day, you could masturbate every other day and see if that increases your energy and desire for partnered sex. Maybe on the days that you are feeling less sexual with your partner, you show up for her anyway and make out with her while she masturbates, give her oral, finger her, use toys on her, or something of the like. Make the session about her, not you. Perhaps there’s some aspect about the fantasies and scenarios you feel comfortable exploring through AI that you can share with your wife, either by viewing/reading porn together or role-playing. But it sounds like you’re having a healthy amount of sex. It could be that you’re at your natural limit for partnered sex, and masturbation is simply not affecting it. Again, experiment. Go a week without masturbating and see if your sex drive for your partner increases. You may surprise yourself, or you might not.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a very small amount of blood, but it means that the majority of my loads have a light pink or red tinge to them. I’m grateful that this is all I’m dealing with, as I’ve come to learn that prostatitis can present some serious, incredibly painful symptoms for people. From a medical point of view, I’m handling it. I’ve got a good urologist, am attending pelvic floor therapy, and am massaging my prostate regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu32002y3b77pzz8wpgz@published"&gt;But from a sexual point of view, I’m having a hard time. Cumming is not painful, I’m still horny, and my doc has assured me I should still ejaculate on a semi-regular schedule while I’m working to get this managed. But as a single guy who prefers low-key hookups, I’m struggling to figure out a way to finish with someone without having to explain the whole deal. And while I’ve become accustomed to it, I get that the sight of a red-tinged load of cum is not normal for someone (the first time I saw it myself, I actually fainted!) and isn’t a welcome surprise during climax. Unfortunately, I’m not into orgasm denial/chastity play, and getting off is an important part of a hookup for me if I’m going to have one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu33002z3b774gidhlod@published"&gt;From this, I’m left trying to figure out a way I could possibly hook up with someone (and finish) without them actually seeing my load. Should I make a big deal about being very turned on by cumming on a guy’s backside? Are there ways, both creative and ethical, that I could employ to enjoy some fun with a casual hookup that doesn’t require me to give them a spiel about why they’re seeing what they’re seeing? I’m vers, so I am open to pretty much any suggestion. I’m also on PrEP, vaccinated, and tested regularly—it’s just something about the presence of blood that makes me feel like nondisclosure here is more unethical, somehow. Any guidance is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3500323b77lwddrnkc@published"&gt;Your concerns make sense and underscore a paradox of modern gay hook-up culture: We put ourselves in vulnerable positions again and again with strangers who don’t know (or sometimes don’t &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;) much about us, so they may feel free to dispense their judgment openly, which makes us that much more vulnerable. Your rosé loads could be received by partners with not so much as a shrug, just as easily as they could be regarded with suspicion or even mockery. For you, each shot load is a crapshoot. You could take this as an opportunity: Partners’ reactions will show you whether they’re worth keeping around. You’ll see what they’re made of by what they make of you, to &lt;a href="https://genius.com/Ani-difranco-willing-to-fight-lyrics"&gt;paraphrase Ani DiFranco&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that would mean enduring the bad feedback as well as the good, and it seems like you want to avoid the bad entirely, which is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd69vj6e005x3b77qd4om6jh@published"&gt;Given that hematospermia is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3921834/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;generally regarded as benign&lt;/a&gt; I don’t think you have too much to worry about in terms of the ethics of disclosure here. Sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-in-the-semen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it’s caused by an STI&lt;/a&gt; but you know for a fact that’s not the case here. If it is discovered by your partner, you would definitely want to explain that it’s not the product of an STI, but it makes sense that you want to fly under the radar with your pinkish sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3600333b77zcgu2xuu@published"&gt;You could come inside of them, whether or not you use condoms. Burying your load is the best way to prevent your partner from seeing its color. Guys who want to be bred typically &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be bred, so you are unlikely to arouse suspicion. A condom would be even easier to manage, as you can handle the disposal yourself—tie it up, throw it in the trash, and no one is the wiser. And yes, you can pull out and shoot on their backs as well—offer to towel them down yourself after, and, again, handle the disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64w274003h3b77sv4ao14n@published"&gt;I’m a 38-year-old man, and my wife and I have recently opened our marriage for casual play. This is working out pretty well, all things considered, but we’re not ready for group play at the moment. My wife thinks that means that we can’t reach out to other couples who are looking to swap because her opinion is that a swap means group play with everyone in the same room. I think it’s more likely that you just swap partners in separate spaces. I know there’s no right or wrong answer here, but what’s the more common interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;

If you think about the way the greater culture of swinging and polyamory operates, swapping often takes place at parties/clubs, where the action is out in the open. Yes, some parties have private booths or sections where interested people can go for some one-on-one time, but the general vibe is all out in the open. That, of course, allows for people to scope out the action and potentially join. “Open” often has a multipurpose use when describing relationships—it is often taken as meaning not only that you are open to other partners, but open to a lot of different things that you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64w276003l3b77gf8j4roj@published"&gt;But why leave anything up to assumptions? People have boundaries, and they are best stated upfront. Even if people would normally enter a situation with another couple with the expectation that you all play together (or at least in the same room), you can counter said assumptions by stating your limits and preferences. People will then use that information to determine whether or not they’re willing to hook up with you. There may be couples that you encounter who have a rule that they only play together (in the same room). There may be others who are a bit freer (which is to say: open) and will accept your stated parameters because they’re really into you and want you however they can get you. You can explain to them your reasons for wanting the configurations that you do (you’re new to this, moving slowly, and full-on group play is off the table for the time being) or not. Just be clear and let people respond in kind. You’ll be fine. Certainly, what you are asking for is not unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse experiences and environments in childhood&lt;/strong&gt; may cause a chain reaction of mental and physical health problems later in life, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40289919/"&gt;new University of Georgia research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_102393" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-image-102393 size-medium" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp" alt="Environmental portrait of researcher Sierra Carter in an office in front of bookshelves" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-768x747.webp 768w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-549x534.webp 549w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-810x788.webp 810w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests growing up with negative events and in dangerous communities in early adolescence can alter an entire lifetime, particularly for Black men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that happen to you in childhood — from how you’re raised as a child to the environment that you’re in — can lead to long-standing issues,” said &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/a-new-associate-director-for-cfr/"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/a&gt;, co-author of the study and the new associate director of UGA’s &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/"&gt;Center for Family Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unfavorable environments, treatment in childhoods influence substance use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on data from the UGA-led &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/for-researchers/projects/fachs/"&gt;Family and Community Health Study&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1996, the ongoing study follows more than 800 families, all of which had a fifth grader at the start of the study. The researchers reinterview participants every two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study found starting at age 10, children were already able to register when their environments and treatment around them were unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsafe community environments affected not only the way the children acted but also created a physical, inflammatory response in their central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in young adulthood, these stressors on both body and mind translated to earlier and more frequent use of substances as a way of self-medicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a lag with these background childhood experiences and drinking,” said &lt;a href="https://psychology.uga.edu/directory/people/steven-beach"&gt;Steven Beach&lt;/a&gt;, corresponding author of the study and director of the Center for Family Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once kids moved out of the protective environment of their homes, the delayed inflammatory responses had a chance to emerge and influence their behavior in a bigger way, setting the stage for elevated alcohol consumption.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol misuse causes lasting physical consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol over time created measurable health complications in adulthood for participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who reported drinking heavily as young adults were at higher risk of heart problems as they got older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, those 29-year-olds had worse aging outcomes as a result of this drinking, meaning there was a possibly shorter life expectancy, and faster signs of aging across numerous body systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect of alcohol on aging was especially pronounced for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous childhoods have disproportionate effect on Black men, women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of adverse childhoods were compounded for Black men and women, largely due to the added effects of discrimination in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being exposed to racial discrimination puts you at risk for early alcohol use, which then puts you at risk for later alcohol use and other diseases down the road,” Carter said. “That’s a well-established pathway that gets people on this difficult trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black participants who experienced racism in early life were more likely to binge drink and experience cardiac issues and faster aging in their appearance and body functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I firmly believe that we can do better than we currently are in terms of protecting children in a whole variety of ways,” Beach said. “It’s just really important for us to think about the delayed effects of childhood experiences that carry forward and have an impact on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study also underscores the likely payoff of investments in children and building strong, safe communities. If we can intervene early, if we can support kids, the payoffs are likely to not just be immediate. They’re likely to be very long lasting, all the way out through adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was published in Development and Psychopathology and was funded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse awarded and National Institute on Aging. Co-authors include the late Ron Simons, Regents Professor in the UGA Department of Sociology, who passed away in March.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Chiara Maffei, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
      
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;A scientific team supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a new, ultra-high-resolution brain imaging system that can reconstruct microscopic brain structures that are disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. The new system is a significant advance over conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners that cannot visualize these tiny but clinically important structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system, called the Connectome 2.0 human MRI scanner, overcomes a significant hurdle for neuroscientists: being able to bridge different brain regions and probe tiny structures necessary to define the “connectome,” the complex matrix of structural connections between nodes in the nervous system, and to do it noninvasively in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research is a transformative leap in brain imaging – pushing the boundaries of what we can see and understand about the living human brain at a cellular level,” said John Ngai, Ph.D., Director of NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “The new scanner lays essential groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/neuroimaging-technologies-across-scales/brain-initiative-connectivity-across-scales"&gt;BRAIN CONNECTS&lt;/a&gt; program’s ultimate goal of developing a wiring diagram for the human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner is innovative in two major ways: it fits snugly around the heads of living people, and it has many more channels than typical MRI systems. These advances greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, providing much sharper images of very small biological brain structures than previously possible. These technical upgrades will enable scientists to map human brain fibers and cellular architecture down to nearly single-micron precision to study how subtle changes in cells and connections relate to cognition, behavior, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team showed that the scanner was safe in healthy research volunteers, revealing subtle microstructural differences (individual axon diameter or cell size) between individual brains. Before this new system, this was only feasible in postmortem or animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to build an imaging platform that could truly span scales – from cells to circuits,” said senior author Susie Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of the Department of Radiology at Mass General Hospital. “It provides researchers and clinicians with a powerful new tool to study brain architecture in health and disease, in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is an important step toward developing a complete wiring diagram of the brain, an achievement that requires novel approaches to map the brain at different scales: across large brain regions and circuits, as well as at the level of tiny cells and connections. It also opens the door for future advances in precision neuroscience, in which noninvasive brain stimulation may help treat brain disorders tailored to an individual’s unique brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded in part by The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. It supports the BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (BRAIN CONNECTS) program, which aims to develop the research capacity and technical capabilities to generate wiring diagrams that can span entire brains across multiple scales. The findings were reported July 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors gave her just a 32 percent chance of surviving the next five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I was in complete shock.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say breast cancer cases among young women are now &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fb-6039909/WHAT-BREAST-CANCER-PEOPLE-DOES-STRIKE-SYMPTOMS.html"&gt;rising by up to 1.85 percent per year, with an extra 4,000 women being diagnosed with the cancer annually in the US compared to a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While breast cancer in women in their 20s is rare, it's not unheard of. About 6.5 out of every 100,000 women in their 20s will receive a breast cancer diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They remain puzzled by the surge, especially in healthy, young individuals, though some have pointed to possible environmental triggers or earlier onset of puberty as potential factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Caldwell, who is from Russell,the diagnosis came with devastating physical symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortly after learning she had stage four breast cancer, the 25-year-old developed crippling back pain caused by a tumor pressing against her spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pain became so severe it made walking and even basic movement difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors immediately began an aggressive treatment plan, starting with 12 rounds of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell has already completed nine and may also undergo immunotherapy and radiation depending on how her body responds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caldwell is pictured above amid chemotherapy, she has been recommended for 12 rounds of the treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her story to local news station &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wsaz.com/2025/07/15/savannahs-story-local-woman-battles-breast-cancer-25/"&gt;WSAZ&lt;/a&gt; , she said: 'At night, especially when with my kids, whenever we cuddle up... I look over... and I just hope I get to see them grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things change minute-by-minute, but for the most part I am being very optimistic. I hope my will to fight can get me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to fight, I want to live and I want my story to be a beautiful one no matter how long or short it is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell said the chemotherapy has gone well so far, but that she has started to lose her hair and has been losing weight rapidly, now being down to 88lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an update after her fourth round of chemotherapy in June, she said: 'Between the third and fourth chemo a lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caldwell said her cancer is stage four and has spread to her ribs, spine and lungs. Doctors say she may also need radiation and immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hair is thinning a lot, just yesterday I noticed it is coming out in clumps. I am still experiencing a lot of back pain, neck pain, [pain] in my ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Through the night, I wake up very nauseous and almost projectile vomiting and it is harder to eat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I look forward to getting this over with, and getting through.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the ninth chemotherapy, she said she was 'still not sleeping much' but 'hanging in there'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have diagnosed her with invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer and behind about 80 percent of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her friends have started a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/savannahs-cancer-battle"&gt;fundraiser online&lt;/a&gt; to raise money to help cover bills and complications linked to the chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the page, they write: 'Savannah is not going to be able to work for a long time. Please help her fight this beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caldwell is pictured above after another round of chemotherapy and after starting to lose her hair, leading her to shave it off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She'd give the shirt off her back for any stranger she met.

        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Measles case confirmed in Cascade County &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from CCHD, the individual resides in Cascade County and is a reported vaccinated adult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person's vaccination status has not been confirmed at this time, and the source of exposure remains unknown. The person is currently isolating at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCHD is continuing to assess any potential exposures while the individual was contagious and may be contacting people known to be exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any additional/new exposures to the public can be found on the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/CCCCHD"&gt;Cascade County website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after, which is how long the measles virus can remain airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growing concerns over measles exposure in Great Falls:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Growing concerns over measles exposure in Great Falls&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. This month, the federal Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) reported the highest number of measles cases in the United States since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. As of July 8, 2025, there were 1,288 reported measles cases in 39 states. Montana has had a total of 26 cases of measles reported in four other counties in addition to Cascade County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have your records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the health department where you grew up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your home state immunization registries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible. CCHD does have MMR vaccine available. Please call 406-454-6950 to make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/DPHHSmeasles"&gt;state health department’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Additional information can also be found on &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MeaslesCDC"&gt;the CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, you should continue to stay home except for testing or urgent/emergency treatment. Please call your healthcare provider or urgent care to arrange for testing. It is extremely important that you do not enter a clinic building without calling ahead to the clinic so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCHD has a measles phone line at 406-791-9242. Please call this number for:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare provider reports of measles cases or suspected cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunization questions, record checks, or appointments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions about exposure or quarantine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any other measles questions or concerns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phone line is operated during business hours – if you call outside normal business hours and leave a message, we will contact you the following business day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But one day, maybe not far off, it could change the way many babies are made everywhere — posing new moral and political questions as reproduction could increasingly become an outcome not of sex but of genetic preselection and data-mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKYAQSE2Y5HU7KVX6JVIMVVDCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For something as consequential as your child, I don’t think people want to roll the dice,” the 30-year-old entrepreneur told The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GER27PVH3RE6LEELOQELAXJ5LM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is now standard for pregnant women and couples undergoing in vitro fertilization to test for rare genetic disorders stemming from a single gene mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. But Orchid is the first company to say it can sequence an embryo’s entire genome of 3 billion base pairs. It uses as few as five cells from an embryo to test&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for more than 1,200 of these uncommon single-gene-derived, or monogenic, conditions. The company also applies custom-built algorithms to produce what are known as polygenic risk scores, which are designed to measure a future child’s genetic propensity for developing complex ailments later in life, such as bipolar disorder, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYCJ7VHH9H2YNBUE968RW8JQ4R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid, Siddiqui &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1859232081202893153"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, is ushering in “a generation that gets to be genetically blessed and avoid disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFCKRQJAQBBQ7O6JMDNKCMS77A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Right now, at $2,500 per embryo-screening on top of the average $20,000 for a single cycle of IVF, Siddiqui’s social network in Silicon Valley and other tech hubs is an ideal target market.

Soon, she suggests, it will be unremarkable for hopeful couples to choose their embryos by spreadsheet, as her current clients do, weighing, say, a propensity for heart disease that is 1.7 times the risk of the general population against a 2.7 score for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LME7AKY6B5DANJI3SKP4JKWZL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Zilis, the mother of four of Musk’s at least 14 children, has been an Orchid client, according to two people close to the company, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. They said at least one of Musk and Zilis’s offspring is an Orchid baby. Siddiqui declined to comment on that assertion, which was first reported by the Information, a tech industry news site, last summer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Musk and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COTBZAATHBATLLK5DFGXAKM2ZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid represents a slice of a broader&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cultural movement in which powerful people in Washington and Silicon Valley are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pushing the importance of producing offspring. Vice President JD Vance, Musk and Siddiqui’s early benefactor, the conservative&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;billionaire investor Peter Thiel,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have all repeatedly argued that falling birth rates threaten&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the future of industrialized nations and that people should have more children to counteract the decline — a viewpoint known as pronatalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VCFB3AKAR5HY7PXAJBRIPK4OOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This growing movement, which is far from a monolith&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and has fierce debates within it, is giving a huge boost to a fertility industry already experiencing heightened demand. In February, the Trump White House issued an executive order pushing for expanded access to IVF. And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;while the loudest voices arguing that people should have more babies are on the right, there’s broader political&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;support for increasing access to fertility treatments: A California law mandating that all large insurers cover IVF and other fertility services went into effect on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WGOPNPUNRAJRAOPKVIG63EHJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Silicon Valley, innovations that could make these services more affordable and accessible are coming, some of them backed by people concerned with population decline. Thiel has funded the egg-freezing robotics start-up TMRW, launched a $200 million fund to bring fertility services to Asia and bankrolled a family planning app connected to a right-wing magazine. The investor, who is gay, has recently become a father to four children through IVF and surrogacy, according to people familiar with his family choices,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe personal relationships. Thiel declined, through a spokesperson, to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3J3H5D4UNJGY5GOORU6H2GNI6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui, who has already created 16 of her own embryos and plans to do more IVF rounds, says her company has an important role to play in advancing people’s ability to have more children.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;She told The Post that being able to have a healthy child should be considered a basic human right, and she has &lt;a href="https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/conceivable-with-noor-fighting-the-fertility-crisis-with-robin-hanson"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; a podcast episode&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;on “Fighting the Fertility Crisis,” a discussion about the causes of population decline. The extensive genetic screening Orchid provides, she said, can help more people have babies — both by improving the IVF success rate and allaying parents’ fears about future babies’ health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BYH7GAMZ3RB6PJBFZC5PF67EYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I think everyone who wants to have a baby should be able to have one,” she said, adding that IVF and genetic testing should be made available and affordable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UISXH2T5TBCMVCW63SBEFDTGTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Orchid doesn’t just help people have children; it helps them shape their future children in dramatically new ways. And that has sparked controversy. Some critics see its polygenic scoring as veering toward a contemporary form of eugenics, enabling a world in which the rich leap even further ahead with super intelligence and superior health starting from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R7YGDNPLPFEITLWDZSWMJZVWFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Musk, who has funded a population research institute at the University of Texas, wants to produce offspring with genes for superior intelligence, Zilis told one of Musk’s biographers. The two people close to the company said Siddiqui has provided intelligence screenings in the past to couples on an ad hoc basis — including, one of them said, to Zilis and Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SSQY2J4GI5CW7EH6O63TN2WUPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid declined to comment on that and vociferously rejected any association with eugenics. Siddiqui said Orchid helps prospective parents who would otherwise fear having children because of potential genetic disorders. IVF was controversial when it began in the 1970s, she said; protesters showed up with “pitchforks” at the offices of the scientists pioneering the breakthrough and tried “to put them in jail” for playing God. If they had prevailed, she added, “12 million people wouldn’t exist today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DULTN4J6PJA55NLJNBZSPBHO2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid screens for intellectual disability but does not provide intelligence predictions, Siddiqui said. A growing number of start-ups do, however. One of them is the Thiel-funded start-up Nucleus; another is Heliospect Genomics,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the research arm of Herasight, an executive of which is a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;bioethicist who advocates “liberal eugenics” — casting that term as applying not to governmental efforts to weed out undesirable births but instead to parents’ use of emerging biological tools to enhance their children’s prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6X2CWJFKFAI5LSQFRWPQQSG2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Until last month, Orchid’s website featured&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;advice from that bioethicist, Jonathan Anomaly, on overcoming skepticism about its service. “We intentionally alter our environments, breed crops so that they’re more nutritious and easier to harvest, and we’ve invented lightning rods and vaccines to make us less likely to die from natural disasters,” he wrote. “I find the playing God objection a bit tiresome.” Orchid removed the page after The Post asked about it. Anomaly said he now prefers the term “genetic enhancement” to “eugenics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HDREYTYJ4RAA7J3ZQYEWQEGBKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund who has invested in Nucleus, made a similar argument. “When you choose your married partner, you’re using a form of eugenics,” he said. “When your kids are older, you invest in tutors and great schools. What’s the harm in using a tool that allows you to amplify that type of effect?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LUEFSOBARVHHVPJZKPZX6SCCJU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LUEFSOBARVHHVPJZKPZX6SCCJU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;‘Russian roulette’ or a jet to the future?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5T6OBIJ4NFA55JWAVPK4SELMNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the United States, there are virtually no restrictions on the types of genetic predictions companies can offer, and no external vetting of their proprietary scoring methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHB4KE2IF5FEZGS62YVTZGWAFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid and a handful of other start-ups offering polygenic risk scores are barreling forward in this largely unregulated milieu.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The first Orchid baby was born in late 2023, and Orchid is now in 100 IVF clinics in the U.S. — more than twice as many as a year ago. (The company won’t say how many babies have been born using its service.) Nucleus launched its screenings, which test embryos for more than 900 heritable traits and conditions, last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTFY2BJ5O5FUTAZIQIEC5RRLEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet several genetic scientists told The Post they doubt Orchid’s core claim: that it can accurately sequence an entire human genome from just five cells collected from an early-stage embryo, enabling it to see many more single- and multiple-gene-derived disorders than other methods have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-image subtype-StaffPhoto size-large" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDR2IVFFHBE7LEWFI2ZNMBK53U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts have struggled to extract accurate genetic information from small embryonic samples, said Svetlana Yatsenko, a Stanford University pathology professor who specializes in clinical and research genetics. Genetic tests that use saliva or blood samples typically collect hundreds of thousands of cells. For its vastly smaller samples, Orchid uses a process called amplification, which creates copies of the DNA retrieved from the embryo. That process, Yatsenko said, can introduce major inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RUALSKIKBVAMFMU3QEJTSY7A3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re making many, many mistakes in the amplification,” she said, rendering it problematic to declare any embryo free of a particular disease, or positive for one. “It’s basically Russian roulette.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDGSGO2H5FFGDNDGQ6VFLAGX4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;George Church, a genomic sequencing pioneer at Harvard University and an Orchid investor, harbors no such doubts. Questioning the advancement&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that enables Orchid to sequence the full genome from such a small sample — enabling long-term health predictions and near-term defect detections in an embryo — is “like asking how much faster is a jet than walking,” Church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLG7SRM5ABGCVNWY7EHH6JIGA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Relying on a small number of cells is not the technology’s only shortcoming, other experts said. Numerous fertility doctors and scientists also told The Post they have serious reservations about screening embryos through polygenic risk scoring,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the technique that allows Orchid and other companies to predict future disease by tying clusters of hundreds or even thousands of genes to disease outcomes and in some cases to other traits, such as intelligence and height. The vast majority of diseases that afflict humans are associated with many different genes rather than a single gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V58QFNV5P51BQBT9CEACE6FZ9R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These algorithmic scoring methods&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are increasingly accepted by scientific and medical experts because they have shown promise in predicting the occurrence in a general population of a growing number of common ailments, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and breast cancer. Researchers and clinicians hope that such complex genetic predictions will come to significantly enhance the quality of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GAPD6DYK355U901Y6AD6YW9Z8W" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the genetic code reflects only propensities: Much is still unknown about how constellations of genes and gene variants interact with an individual’s environment and with one another to contribute to the likelihood of any individual getting a disease in life. And for traits such as intelligence, polygenic scoring has &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/how-well-can-genetic-scores-predict-iq-heres-what-the-latest-research-reveals/"&gt;almost negligible predictive capacity&lt;/a&gt; — just a handful of IQ points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DJCGJULSJDMPC3VWUJI6DGKRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Critics say&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;such scoring could compel&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;couples who have struggled with fertility issues to discard perfectly good and hard-won embryos based on inaccurate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;or incomplete information. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38805697/"&gt;2024 paper raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the scores could encourage couples to unnecessarily incur the cost and physical burden of additional rounds of IVF. Or parents might select against an unwanted trait, such as schizophrenia, without understanding how they may be screening out desired traits associated with the same genes, such as creativity. “Maybe we don’t want to screen those people out of our society,” said Lior Pachter, a computational biologist specializing in genomics at the California Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A33VGUDTUNCZJFFMSHHY25J3VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions from The Post, an Orchid spokeswoman, Tara Harandi-Zadeh, said the company explicitly counsels patients not to throw away embryos. Company executives also downplayed the value of Orchid’s polygenic scores, which one described in an interview as merely an “add-on” benefit of the full-genome sequencing the company provides. The primary benefit of its service, she said, is the ability to detect many more single-gene-derived diseases and nonhereditary mutations than a standard genetic test conducted in an IVF clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYYUCHBLK5FGNMI5ZC5TCMJYDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Hundreds of serious monogenic diseases — each with well-established genetic causes — can now be detected before implantation,” Harandi-Zadeh said in a statement. “These aren’t vague risks or statistical associations; they’re clear, causal mutations that lead to profound outcomes: seizures, organ failure, inability to walk or speak, early death. These are missed without comprehensive whole genome embryo screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CRJW7EGKMNBLRG5PCAQ3EPUBAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid’s marketing materials and Siddiqui’s own descriptions have repeatedly showcased polygenic disease screening, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J4YO2VWUV5G2BPAODAFM63E4VY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The parents and their physician get much more information” from polygenic scoring, Siddiqui &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-ZL3pYNxno"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a 2023 video. “They get information about neurodevelopmental disorders, birth defects, pediatric hereditary cancers, complex conditions, meaning conditions where it’s not just a single gene, but dozens, hundreds, to millions of genes that contribute risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OL3UFQ26B5F3LOAKOFA33DS3NU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics&lt;a href="https://www.gimjournal.org/article/S1098-3600(23)01068-7/pdf"&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of screening embryos for polygenic risks “unproven” and warns that such tests “should not be offered” by clinicians. A pioneer of polygenic risk scores, Harvard epidemiology professor Peter Kraft, has criticized Orchid, &lt;a href="https://x.com/genes_pk/status/1380553618777063427?s=46"&gt;saying on X&lt;/a&gt; that “the science doesn’t add up” and that “waving a magic wand and changing some of these variants at birth may not do anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCUXCTZJW5CBTKF4FCEU7AAGMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Still, many of those same experts say the scientific evidence supporting the validity of polygenic scoring methods is only getting better and already making its way into clinical use for adults. Consumer attitudes are liable to change, too. Asparouhov, the investor, said he was still critical of embryo selection based on polygenic scores. “Right now it’s a false choice,” he said. “But in the future, it’s the trust fund.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="5KVFM4MNYT5RQ632F0ZPMF90JC" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="5KVFM4MNYT5RQ632F0ZPMF90JC" data-testid="article-header"&gt;‘A license to do things’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DK84113F796B5FFPMNQCZGPT44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The availability and power of consumer genetic tests have exploded in the past six to 10 years, powered by far cheaper human genome sequencing and large public and private biobanks that store genetic data from hundreds of thousands of volunteers. Researchers have used that data to explore connections between genes and population-wide disease outcomes, in what are known as genome-wide association studies, or GWAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SXSMAOQ2FB73GBD5S4KDNPGPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z"&gt; influential 2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Genetics&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;showed that groups of genes could be analyzed to identify people at significantly increased risk for five common ailments, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. That paper and others opened up the possibility for clinicians to give people specific medical advice and treatments based on their genetic propensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F7LXB57M7JDBVKMUMLKRXWEMWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui founded Orchid the following year. She had moved to Silicon Valley from Northern Virginia after winning, in 2012,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a $100,000 grant from Thiel for aspiring entrepreneurs willing to ditch college to pursue a business idea.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Forgoing a university education was anathema to her Pakistani immigrant parents, she has said, so she applied in secret as a high school senior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBQ6PLMGQ5GLZIMUHA25UWNEUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui’s parents eventually came around, and she credits her mother with being the impetus for Orchid. When Siddiqui was a child, her mother developed retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease caused by a rare genetic mutation. Siddiqui became acutely aware that some people were “genetically privileged” — while others were not, like her mom, who was functionally blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1DT7A7KG9D13QAXZTN1G8ZU2DG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For people who haven’t had that type of tragedy hit them or their family, it’s really hard for them to relate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5CKL5Z4UBANTFHLHEL2PIZW5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a later stint at Stanford, where she completed degrees in computer science, Siddiqui became fascinated by the way data science was transforming biology, creating new potential applications for reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PO6ACZOZZRCD7ASCUYPQUC5X7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She also became steeped in a close-knit milieu of self-described builders who looked up to Thiel. Her husband is a cybersecurity entrepreneur she met while a Thiel fellow; a friend, Laura Deming, who was in Siddiqui’s Thiel Fellowship class, has been working on age-reversing technologies since she was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JPMJKYPMPBEDFGOXF5WUQU4VXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of Siddiqui’s early investors, billionaire Brian Armstrong, the right-leaning CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said he invested after seeing a tweet about a class she was teaching at Stanford, called “Frontiers of Reproductive Technology.” He has tweeted that preimplantation genetic testing is part of a “Gattaca stack” — a reference to a 1997 &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/"&gt;dystopian science fiction film&lt;/a&gt; — of emerging innovations that will “accelerate civilizational progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KKPQKLITMNGSPBOVS7CMSDXKTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Had she not come to Silicon Valley at an early age, Siddiqui said, she would never have had the confidence to start a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TMTWGZMVMFFOHFB3LFESAISLIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Everyone here took me incredibly seriously as a 17-, 18-year-old, working on medical start-ups,” she said in an interview next to San Francisco’s Ferry Building. “It’s just a place where everyone has a license to do things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YAWDSHFBKJBKPLOTTH2WJQQQQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Securing early funding from Armstrong, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, bitcoin and genetics entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, 23&amp;amp;me founder Anne Wojcicki, and others, Siddiqui got to work combing through scientific literature to build the company’s proprietary polygenic scoring methods. In 2022, Orchid had what it describes as its big breakthrough: an innovation that enabled it to sequence all 3 billion base pairs of the human genome from as few as five embryonic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WSGXNJ42NNCJ5K7FQ36HTLJMVM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the paper laying out that breakthrough, published last year in the peer-reviewed journal F&amp;amp;S Reports, is fundamentally flawed, according to Stanford’s Yatsenko and Aleks Rajkovic, chief genomics officer at the University of California at San Francisco Health Center for Clinical Genetics and Genomics. It excluded results that didn’t fit its thesis, Yatsenko said, and both scientists said that by using Orchid’s own lab to check those results, its authors didn’t adhere to ideal scientific practice. Orchid said that the paper’s findings had been verified by independent labs and that there were “zero discrepancies” in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDG4XRQBGZHHPH353XARIGGKUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Todd Lencz, the leader of a federally funded research project examining polygenic embryo screening, said the science isn’t clear enough for use in a clinic. Subtle differences among different companies’ algorithms “can produce strikingly different results in clinical contexts,” said Lencz, a professor at Hofstra University’s Zucker School of Medicine. “There’s no gold-standard consensus about which method is best.” Orchid countered that slight differences in algorithms’&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;results are no argument for preventing people from benefiting from the best scientific knowledge available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TL52DJY7WZFCRNMC6XCM2J7KCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another big issue facing Orchid and other start-ups is that polygenic scores can be up to half as accurate, according to some researchers, for some people with non-European ancestry. The primary pools of genetic data available to researchers come from European and American sources, especially the UK Biobank, a large database in the United Kingdom that includes the genetic data of a half-million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZKG574SI5BEMLG75Q3EE4POVBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui told The Post that Orchid is well aware of the potential for bias, noting that she is South Asian and her husband has Middle Eastern ancestry. She said the company uses standard statistical methods to correct for limitations in the scores. In some circumstances, she said, Orchid does not offer any score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ABFG5XSX7VHUNEHIMUW7P6MYLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The data used to create risk scores draws on the genetics of people who are now adults and often elderly, and it’s unclear how much the risks faced by people now in their 70s apply to babies being born today, said Patrick Turley, a statistical-genetics researcher at the University of Southern California. Environmental factors that affect the genes of present-day embryos in-vitro, such as microplastics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are different from environmental factors many years ago, he added. And lifestyle and behavior, which also impact genes and life outcomes, are different today than for generations past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOK26KISVVGIZCZOUNG2DSP5MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s hard to make projections about how well [polygenic scores] are going to predict in the future when the world’s a different place,” Turley said, while emphasizing that genetic embryo selection could benefit certain couples, such as those who are carriers of rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJPQW7WXRZHLTG4ECSZEOC7EGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid said research has shown that genetic predispositions are “remarkably stable” across decades. “Genetic signal doesn’t vanish just because the world changes,” spokeswoman Harandi-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZ6K2EFK3JFHFARXQOIO2Z4QJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pachter, the Caltech computational biologist, has called Orchid’s offerings “amoral nonsense” and said conveying genetic information in numerical scores gives a certain “class of people” the illusion of more control than they really have, and validates the feeling that “one’s own genome must be special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="9XVUTW6UMN2XQ8Y6DPYQZYRBMC" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid rejected Pachter’s criticism, too. “It’s easy to moralize from an ivory tower when your child isn’t the one who might be born with a fatal disease,” Harandi-Zadeh said. “This isn’t about ‘some illusion of control.’ It’s about giving families the ability to prevent real suffering based on the most accurate information modern science can provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZOLJDZ6YSVGQZOB7ET3IRF7W2Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZOLJDZ6YSVGQZOB7ET3IRF7W2Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Seeking ‘peace of mind’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WACPVFWZ5EJDB3H4LA7LVYM7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Roshan George, a start-up executive in San Francisco, said that when he and his wife, Julie Kang, used Orchid last year, the company’s genetic counselors gave detailed explanations about the probabilities of different predictions, emphasizing that “nothing is 100 percent certain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7VNTC56QJDPJELTDNDVFCFO6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple sought out Orchid after learning, during a standard parental genetic screening process at their IVF clinic, that both were carriers of a rare genetic mutation that causes irreversible hearing loss soon after the child is born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFA422BG3BH7PAR7CFVYPGURPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple’s main concern was whether they were passing the hearing loss variant on to their embryo. Though they probably could have found out by screening the embryos at an IVF clinic through standard processes, which amplify a snippet of the genome, George sought out full genome screening for “a more complete picture” and “peace of mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ELR6DR6X7ZCK7OMDBLKJU27O2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;George and Kang produced 12 embryos and used Orchid to screen all of them — a cost of $30,000 on top of IVF. Six were viable. Two had the hearing loss gene variant. Another two were carriers, which meant they could pass the gene on to their children but wouldn’t be affected themselves. And two, called embryos JK3 and 6-JK in Orchid’s report, were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OCCFSAPSJFB3ZAVI4PHXP6EGMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple pored over their spreadsheets, debating which of the two to select. One embryo had a 1.5 percent lifetime risk of bipolar disorder, about half that of the general population. But its type 2 diabetes risk — 29 percent — was slightly above average, about 1.2 times that of a typical person. Another had a slightly higher risk of obesity. Given his and Kang’s ethnicities — South and East Asian, respectively — George took the predictions with “a grain of salt.” After weighing all the other factors, the polygenic scoring became “the tiebreaker,” George said. Kang gave birth in March; so far, their daughter, Astra Meridian, has perfect hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6BG3KPUY5F5DG7W5SU2YRAOZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The family’s experience is likely to be a window into the future, scientists said, in which an abundance of data offers families improved odds for healthy children and fraught reproductive choices. If families seek that information, the medical industry shouldn’t be “paternalistic” and deny them, UCSF’s Rajkovic said, but companies have to be careful not to promise more certainty than science can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XBI3P25SZCNXOK4UXUZA7GVUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid’s offerings are “not ready for prime time,” according to Rajkovic. But the premise the company is pursuing — better odds for healthy babies — is “commendable in terms of pushing the barriers,” he said. “Because genetic disease can be devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-quote subtype-blockquote" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css blockquote border-box black font--article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="EJI4M3JCCZGUJHIJAJDQ5PJWDQ" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="LY2HXHBVL5D25HAN5P2SBXCHRI" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hiUTBI-isFirst-false"&gt;Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.

First, that specific foods directly affect dreams (the “food-specific” effect); second, that certain foods cause physical discomfort, disrupting dreams (the “food distress” effect); and third, that food changes sleep quality, which in turn affects dream content (the “sleep effects” theory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the survey were asked about their diet, food allergies, and intolerances, as well as their sleep habits and dream patterns, using tools such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Nightmare Disorder Index. What they found was quite illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little more than 40% of survey respondents reported that food had some effect on their sleep, with 24.7% stating that certain foods worsened their sleep and 20.1% claiming some foods improved their ZZZ’s. Just 5.5% of participants reported that eating specific foods before bed directly influenced their dreams, and when it did, it tended to be linked to nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-related nightmares were more commonly blamed on sweets (31%) and dairy products (22%). The researchers also found that people with food allergies and gluten intolerance were more likely to say their dreams were affected by food, and those with lactose intolerance were far more likely to report frequent nightmares. The likely culprit, the researchers noted, was gastrointestinal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nightmares are worse for lactose-intolerant people who suffer severe gastrointestinal symptoms and whose sleep is disrupted,” Dr. Tore Nielsen of Université de Montréal, lead author of the study, shared in a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/late-night-cheese-may-fuel-nightmares-new-study-explains-how/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This makes sense, because we know that other bodily sensations can affect dreaming. Nightmares can be very disruptive, especially if they occur often, because they tend to awaken people from sleep in a dysphoric state. They might also produce sleep avoidance behaviors. Both symptoms can rob you of restful sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/fermented-foods-sleep-study-11687048" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Food Group May Be the Secret to Better Sleep, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Food Group May Be the Secret to Better Sleep, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these findings shouldn’t deter you from your love of cheese just yet. As Nielsen noted, his team needs to continue its work to study more people of different ages, “walks of life, and with different dietary habits to determine if our results are truly generalizable to the larger population.” He added, “Experimental studies are also needed to determine if people can truly detect the effects of specific foods on dreams.” So, he’s hoping to run a study asking people to eat cheese versus “some control food before sleep to see if this alters their sleep or dreams.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if you’re someone who really seems to have nightmares after eating cheese, Nielsen says the answer is simple: Change your eating habits, which “could alleviate nightmares.” If you want to improve your sleep, the team found that fruit, herbal tea, and vegetables were all foods participants said helped them sleep better. But if you’re sleeping just fine after that mozzarella stick, then by all means, carry on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reviewed by&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Manaker MS, RDN, LD, CLEC&lt;/strong&gt;: Lauren is an award-winning registered dietitian and three-time book author, with more than 22 years in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cheese-consumption-linked-to-nightmares-11769272" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp;

&lt;p&gt;HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. — Florida health officials are warning residents after a flesh-eating bacteria has already killed four people, including one in the Tampa Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health is &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that there have been deaths in Bay, Broward, St. Johns and Hillsborough counties in 2025. This includes 11 cases reported throughout the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria, known as Vibrio Vulnificus, are a rare infection that lives in warm seawater and are part of a group of bacteria called “halophilic” because they require salt.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida DOH said not to enter waters if you have fresh cuts or scrapes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're immunocompromised, including if you have chronic liver disease, kidney disease or a weakened immune system, you should wear proper foot protection to prevent cuts and injury caused by rocks and shells on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus can also cause illness when ingested, sometimes in raw shellfish like oysters.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Do not eat raw oysters or other raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels) thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For shellfish in the shell, either boil until the shells open and continue boiling for five more minutes, or steam until the shells open and then continue cooking for nine more minutes. Do not eat those shellfish that do not open during cooking. Boil shucked oysters at least three minutes, or fry them in oil at least 10 minutes at 375°F.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid cross-contamination of cooked seafood and other foods with raw seafood and juices from raw seafood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat shellfish promptly after cooking and refrigerate leftovers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish harvested from such waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear protective clothing (e.g., gloves) when handling raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The European Space Agency (ESA) and UK-based &lt;a href="https://www.fnc.co.uk/"&gt;Frazer-Nash&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.fnc.co.uk/discover-frazer-nash/news/pioneering-new-programme-to-realise-lift-off-for-horizontal-space-launch/"&gt;kicked off INVICTUS&lt;/a&gt;, a research programme with the goal of developing hypersonic technologies applicable to future reusable vehicles capable of horizontal launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;INVICTUS is funded through ESA’s &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Shaping_the_Future/About_the_General_Support_Technology_Programme_GSTP"&gt;General Support Technology Programme&lt;/a&gt; (GSTP) and &lt;a href="https://technology.esa.int/program/tde"&gt;Technology Development Element&lt;/a&gt; (TDE) and is a fully reusable experimental aerospace vehicle capable of flying at Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vehicle will demonstrate key technologies for sustained hypersonic flight in the atmosphere and will be upgradable, allowing for the exchange of materials, software and propulsion systems between flight test campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVICTUS builds on previous technology developments managed by ESA and will offer industry, agencies and academia an opportunity to test future hypersonic technologies in a relevant environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges of operating a hypersonic vehicle is that at high speed, due to shock heating and surface friction, the outer surface of the aircraft and the air entering the engines are extremely hot. These conditions call for specialised technologies as well as unique propulsion systems to power the vehicle through the high speed ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Perigo, ESA’s chemical propulsion engineer and the programme’s technical lead, explains: “The INVICTUS programme will prove the suitability of a hydrogen-fuelled precooled air-breathing propulsion system for horizontal take-off and hypersonic flight. It will provide an invaluable opportunity to test the complete engine flow path, from intake to afterburner, at full scale in an integrated aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The precooler system, building on technology developed through ESA's &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/12/SABRE-powered_launch_system_beyond_2030"&gt;SABRE&lt;/a&gt; study, was designed by UK-based Reaction Engines Ltd and funded through ESA’s GSTP in its initial stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This innovative technology, able to chill superheated air in a fraction of a second, has already been successfully demonstrated through integration with conventional jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a cooling system, the lightweight architecture of a SABRE-like engine paves the way for true spaceplanes, able to take off horizontally from a runway, taking us a step closer to widespread access to space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Ford, Head of ESA's Chemical Propulsion Section, comments: “INVICTUS is an important next step in developing the technologies required for future spaceplanes and will give Europe a unique asset for exploring this type of flight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Wilkes, Managing Director at Frazer-Nash, said: “INVICTUS is an exciting opportunity to provide advanced technology for space and realise dual-use capabilities. With strong industry support and deep engineering and aerospace expertise – including Frazer-Nash colleagues with a decade of propulsion experience – we have all the right ingredients to make this ambitious vision a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommaso Ghidini, Head of ESA’s Mechanical Department, adds: “Hypersonic flight is not just the next frontier of aerospace – it is the gateway to a new paradigm of mobility, defence, and space access. With INVICTUS, Europe is seizing the opportunity to lead in technologies that will redefine how we move across the planet and reach beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By mastering reusable, air-breathing propulsion, we are laying the foundation for aircraft that take off like planes and reach orbit like rockets – revolutionising both terrestrial and orbital transportation. This is where dual-use innovation meets strategic autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Forsythe, Head of Space technology at the UK Space Agency, said: “This exciting project, made possible by our investments in the European Space Agency, has significant potential to build on advanced cooling and hypersonic propulsion technology developed by UK engineers over many years. We look forward to seeing how the work develops and the opportunity it presents for boosting economic growth and national security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 months, the INVICTUS consortium, led by Frazer-Nash and including &lt;a href="https://www.spiritaero.com/"&gt;Spirit AeroSystems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/"&gt;Cranfield University&lt;/a&gt;, will deliver the preliminary design of the full flight system.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have not been able to identify a single or even a handful of causes for precocious puberty, though experts have previously told MailOnline that some underlying factors include obesity, stress, and genetics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, the scientists assessed 1,407 Taiwanese teens, who undertook diet questionnaires and urine tests, and discovered 481 had undergone early puberty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They found the artificial sweetener sucralose showed a stronger link with early puberty in boys, while aspartame, glycyrrhizin and regular added sugars showed a stronger link in girls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts also found t&lt;/span&gt;he risk was most pronounced in those who already had a genetic predisposition towards an earlier puberty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, and has yet to be published in full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But common limitations of diet studies include the fact eating habits are often self-reported.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sucralose is made from normal sucrose table sugar but is chemically altered so the body doesn't process it as a carbohydrate, meaning that it contains no calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the main ingredient in the Canderel sweetener. Glycyrrhizin, on the other hand, comes from liquorice roots and is a natural sweetener.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research from the same team found that some sweeteners can affect the release of puberty-related hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The risk was most pronounced in those who already had a genetic predisposition towards an earlier puberty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Particular products containing aspartame — which entered the market in the 1980s — include Diet Coke, Dr Pepper as well as Extra chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts. Some toothpastes, dessert mixes, and sugar-free cough drops also contain it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the chemicals were having this effect by influencing the function of cells in the brain or by altering the make-up of bacteria in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns about the impact artificial sweeteners, which are added a plethora of products to make them TAST sweet with fewer calories, could be having health, including its cardiovascular impact, have circulated for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But critics highlight such studies are only observational, meaning they are unable to prove artificial sweeteners are the culprit and cannot rule out other external factors being to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fears have also been raised about links between artificial sweeteners and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These worries were heightened in 2023 after the World Health Organisation controversially classified the artificial sweetener aspartame, found in drinks like Diet Coke, as&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12299515/Outrage-unnecessary-fears-sparked-WHOs-aspartame-cancer-ruling.html"&gt; 'possibly carcinogenic to humans'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UN agency ruled it only posed a risk to those who consumed massive amounts and that an 11 stone (70kg) adult could safely drink about 14 cans a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research also suggests that girls who go through puberty at earlier ages could be at risk for health issues later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 US study found that girls who started their period before the age of 13 were at a higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7ad589e0-623c-11f0-af39-83939e4799b9"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and suffering strokes in adulthood than their peers who began menstruating later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another, published in the Lancet, found that girls who started their periods at early ages were at an increased risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have put the surge in girls starting puberty younger down to the ongoing obesity crisis, with fat cells containing hormonal properties triggering puberty at a younger age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780443138034000057"&gt;big business&lt;/a&gt;. Marketed as quick fixes for fatigue and performance dips, energy drinks are especially popular among &lt;a href="https://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/S1056-4993(10)00031-3/abstract"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/use-of-energy-drinks-in-sport-perceived-ergogenicity-and-side-effects-in-male-and-female-athletes/335349F12D8EBE19FA91B032546ADC87"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563047/"&gt;sports enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, and so-called "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2966367/"&gt;weekend warriors&lt;/a&gt;" – people who pack their workouts into the weekend instead of exercising regularly. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-020-09442-8"&gt;Gamers&lt;/a&gt; are now a major target too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the market grows, so do concerns about what's actually in these drinks – and what these &lt;a href="https://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk426/files/content/infosheets/fact-pro-energydrinks.pdf"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; might be doing to our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many energy drinks contain some combination of three familiar stimulants: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, found naturally in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, tea and cacao; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874113005771"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt;, an Amazonian plant rich in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/taurine"&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring amino acid found in scallops, mussels, turkey and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Discover Unexpected Link Between Diet And Lung Cancer Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine, in particular, has drawn both hype and hope. It is credited with &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00438-0#Abs1"&gt;performance-enhancing properties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/#abstract1"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But new research is raising important questions about how it behaves in the body – and when it might do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-07711-z"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sparked headlines and unease in equal measure. It found that taurine may fuel the progression of &lt;a href="https://bloodcancer.org.uk/understanding-blood-cancer/leukaemia/"&gt;leukaemia&lt;/a&gt;, a group of blood cancers that begin in the bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that while healthy bone marrow cells naturally produce taurine, leukaemia cells cannot. But they can absorb taurine from their surroundings and use it as a fuel source to grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on mice and in human leukaemia cell samples demonstrated that taurine in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8194051/"&gt;tumour microenvironment&lt;/a&gt; – the area around a tumour that includes blood vessels, immune cells and structural support – accelerated the progression of leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, when researchers blocked taurine uptake by leukaemia cells (using genetic techniques),  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; progression slowed significantly. The authors suggest taurine supplements could potentially worsen outcomes in people with leukaemia and propose that developing targeted ways to block taurine uptake by cancer cells might offer a new treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taurine: friend or foe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the human body, found in especially high concentrations in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8400259/"&gt;heart, muscles and brain&lt;/a&gt;. In healthy people, it's &lt;a href="https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0148607190014002183"&gt;mainly obtained through diet&lt;/a&gt;, but the body can also synthesise taurine from the amino acids &lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(22)02429-4/pdf"&gt;methionine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275665776_L-Cysteine_metabolism_and_its_nutritional_implications"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;, provided it has enough &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in foods such as salmon, tuna, chicken, bananas and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people consuming a typical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/"&gt;western diet take in 40mg–400mg of taurine&lt;/a&gt; a day from food alone. This figure refers only to taurine that is directly ingested, not including the additional amount the body can synthesise internally, which may vary depending on age, diet and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is listed on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Taurine#section=FDA-Generally-Recognized-as-Safe---GRAS-Notices"&gt;generally recognised as safe (GRAS) database&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2815"&gt;European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)&lt;/a&gt;, it's safe to consume up to six grams per day. By comparison, a serving of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5215981/"&gt;Red Bull or Monster&lt;/a&gt; contains around one gram – comfortably below that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent concerns about a possible link to blood cancer progression, taurine isn't inherently harmful. In fact, some people may benefit from supplementation, especially those receiving long-term &lt;a href="https://www.uhsussex.nhs.uk/resources/understanding-parenteral-nutrition/"&gt;parenteral nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, where nutrients are delivered directly into the bloodstream because the gut isn't working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.biomolther.org/journal/view.html?uid=948&amp;amp;vmd=Full&amp;amp;"&gt;chronic liver, kidney or heart failure&lt;/a&gt; may also have trouble producing or holding on to enough taurine, making supplementation helpful in specific clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some research suggests taurine may actually &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/cancerjournal/fulltext/2015/11020/effect_of_taurine_on_attenuating.35.aspx"&gt;help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in leukaemia patients&lt;/a&gt; – even as emerging studies raise concerns that it could also fuel the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contradiction underscores how much context matters: the effects of taurine depend not just on dosage and delivery, but also on the patient's underlying condition. What helps in one context, could harm in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the catch: taking taurine as a supplement for particular health reasons is very different from consuming large quantities through energy drinks, which &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdr2.1177"&gt;often combine&lt;/a&gt; taurine with high levels of caffeine and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination can put strain on the heart, interfere with sleep and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10535526/"&gt;increase the risk of side effects&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for people with underlying health conditions or those taking other stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research raises important questions about whether taurine-heavy products could be harmful in some cases, especially for people with, or at risk of, blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, should you worry?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-drinks-evidence-brief/"&gt;According to the current evidence&lt;/a&gt;, if you're a healthy adult who occasionally sips an energy drink, there's little cause for alarm. But moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming multiple high-taurine drinks daily or taking taurine supplements (without prior professional consultation), on top of a taurine-rich diet might not be wise, especially if future research confirms links between taurine and cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more is known, the safest approach would be to enjoy your energy boosts by consuming a nutritious diet &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/energy-drinks-and-young-people.html"&gt;rather than consuming energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any underlying health conditions – or a family history of cancer – it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before diving into taurine supplementation or consumption of energy drinks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256957/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The implant mimics the spinal cord’s structure with a fine, electrically conductive mesh, boosting neuron and stem cell growth in lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the fibre layout, the team improved the implant’s effectiveness, opening possibilities for wider medical use.

In Ireland, more than 2,300 individuals and families are living with spinal cord injury, but no treatment currently exists to effectively repair the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, therapeutic electrical stimulation at the injury site has shown potential in encouraging nerve cells (neurons) to regrow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Promoting the regrowth of neurons after spinal cord injury has been historically difficult however our group is developing electrically conductive biomaterials that could channel electrical stimulation across the injury, helping the body to repair the damaged tissue” explains Professor Fergal O’Brien, Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation and Professor of Bioengineering and Regenerative Medicine at RCSI and Head of RCSI’s Tissue Engineering Research Group (TERG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unique environment provided by the AMBER Centre which sees biomedical engineers, biologists and material scientists working together to solve grand societal challenges provides a major opportunity for disruptive innovation such as this”.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers at RCSI’s TERG and the Research Ireland Centre Advanced Materials and Bioengineering Research (AMBER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used ultra-thin nanomaterials from Professor Valeria Nicolosi’s laboratory in the School of Chemistry and AMBER at Trinity College Dublin which are normally used for applications like battery design and integrated them into a soft gel-like structure using 3-D printing techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting implant mimics the structure of the human spinal cord and features a fine mesh of tiny fibres that can conduct electricity to our cells. When tested in the lab, the implant was shown to effectively deliver electrical signals to neurons and stem cells, enhancing their ability to grow.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modifying the fibre layout within the implant was also found to further improve its effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These 3D-printed materials allow us to tune the delivery of electrical stimulation to control regrowth and may enable a new generation of medical devices for traumatic spinal cord injuries” said Dr Ian Woods, Research Fellow at TERG and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond spinal repair, this technology also has potential for applications in cardiac, orthopaedic and neurological treatments where electrical signalling can drive healing.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCSI and AMBER researchers teamed up with the Irish Rugby Football Union Charitable Trust (IRFU-CT) on the project and brought together an advisory panel to oversee and guide the research. The group included seriously injured rugby players, clinicians, neuroscientists and researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through their expertise, the advisory panel helped deepen our understanding of the lived experiences of individuals with spinal cord injuries, their treatment priorities and emerging treatment approaches” said Dr Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our regular meetings allowed for a consistent exchange of input, ideas and results.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Irish Rugby Football Union Charitable Trust, AMBER the Research Ireland Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research and an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this SCI and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e626f7b7c6f6f606a6b7c7d61604e7c6d7d6720676b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Laura Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rcsi.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RCSI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Laura Anderson – RCSI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;3D-Printing of Electroconductive MXene-based Micro-meshes in a Biomimetic Hyaluronic Acid-based Scaffold Directs and Enhances Electrical Stimulation for Neural Repair Applications&lt;/a&gt;” by Ian Woods et al. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D-Printing of Electroconductive MXene-based Micro-meshes in a Biomimetic Hyaluronic Acid-based Scaffold Directs and Enhances Electrical Stimulation for Neural Repair Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No effective treatments are currently available for central nervous system neurotrauma although recent advances in electrical stimulation suggest some promise in neural tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hypothesized that structured integration of an electroconductive biomaterial into a tissue engineering scaffold can enhance electroactive signaling for neural regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electroconductive 2D Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; MXene nanosheets are synthesized from MAX-phase powder, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility with neurons, astrocytes and microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve spatially-controlled distribution of these MXenes, melt-electrowriting is used to 3D-print highly-organized PCL micro-meshes with varying fiber spacings (low-, medium-, and high-density), which are functionalized with MXenes to provide highly-tunable electroconductive properties (0.081 ± 0.053-18.87 ± 2.94 S/m).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embedding these electroconductive micro-meshes within a neurotrophic, immunomodulatory hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix (ECM) produced a soft, growth-supportive MXene-ECM composite scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of neurons seeded on these scaffolds promoted neurite outgrowth, influenced by fiber spacing in the micro-mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a multicellular model of cell behavior, neurospheres stimulated for 7 days on high-density MXene-ECM scaffolds exhibited significantly increased axonal extension and neuronal differentiation, compared to low-density scaffolds and MXene-free controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate that spatial-organization of electroconductive materials in a neurotrophic scaffold can enhance repair-critical responses to electrical stimulation and that these biomimetic MXene-ECM scaffolds offer a promising new approach to neurotrauma repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📊 &lt;strong&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/strong&gt; completed the largest whole-body imaging project, scanning 100,000 volunteers over 15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 The project provides an unprecedented dataset for advancing disease research, diagnostics, and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Researchers are leveraging the data to develop AI models for early disease detection and understanding organ aging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Over 1,300 scientific papers have been published, showcasing the transformative impact of this &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive dataset&lt;/strong&gt; on medical science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank has achieved a monumental breakthrough in medical imaging, completing the world’s largest whole-body imaging project. This endeavor, stretching over 15 years, saw the participation of 100,000 volunteers, who contributed immensely to advancing disease research and diagnostics. By scanning brains, hearts, abdomens, blood vessels, bones, and joints, UK Biobank has provided researchers with an unprecedented dataset. This accomplishment is not just about numbers; it represents a significant leap forward in understanding human health, influencing prevention methods, and enhancing treatment options worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Detailed Look Inside the Human Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, a cohort of 100,000 dedicated volunteers embarked on an ambitious journey with the UK Biobank, contributing to what would become the largest imaging project of its kind. Among them, Alison, a member of the Participant Advisory Group, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating her motivation was to &lt;i&gt;“create a healthier future for all of us to enjoy.”&lt;/i&gt; These volunteers provided critical data, including lifestyle information and blood samples, which paved the way for groundbreaking research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by a substantial £60 million investment, involved extensive imaging sessions. Each volunteer underwent five-hour imaging appointments, where researchers collected 12,000 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and abdomen. Additionally, ultrasounds of carotid arteries and comprehensive body scans were conducted, measuring bone density and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dJWyw35s9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-redefining-urban-mobility-envos-utility-personal-transporter-unleashed-as-the-future-of-compact-electric-vehicles/"&gt;“We’re Redefining Urban Mobility”: Envo’s Utility Personal Transporter Unleashed as the Future of Compact Electric Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging data has equipped scientists with the tools to explore diseases in unprecedented detail. According to Professor Louise Thomas, &lt;i&gt;“researchers can measure the size, shape, and composition of nearly every organ and tissue in the body in seconds, rather than hours per person.”&lt;/i&gt; This capability marks a significant advancement in the realm of medical research, offering insights previously unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Bright Future for Disease Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging data is already catalyzing significant discoveries in disease research. Scientists are leveraging this vast dataset to develop advanced AI models, such as one for a healthy heart, which aims to detect diseases early. Notably, researchers are beginning to grasp the concept that our organs might age biologically at a different rate than we do. This understanding is reshaping how we perceive age-related diseases and their onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kFAML4AF8u"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-about-to-break-the-ocean-speed-limit-revolutionary-kite-powered-sailboat-closes-in-on-historic-world-record/"&gt;“We’re About to Break the Ocean Speed Limit”: Revolutionary Kite-Powered Sailboat Closes In on Historic World Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the remarkable findings from this dataset is the intricate connection between the heart and brain. Such revelations are possible due to the immense scale of data being integrated into machine learning platforms, allowing for disease prediction years before symptoms manifest. Professor Paul Matthews highlighted the potential of this data, remarking on a study that used brain imaging from 20,000 participants to develop an AI tool capable of predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. &lt;i&gt;“The beauty of UK Biobank is the breadth of the data collected… the imaging scans add another layer of exquisite detail,”&lt;/i&gt; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unprecedented Scale and Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project is remarkable not just for its scale but also for its profound impact on the scientific community. Described as more than ten times larger than any prior studies, this project offers researchers the ability to discern disease patterns previously invisible. By providing a panoramic view of the human body, the data allows for a holistic understanding of how various aspects of our lives, from lifestyle choices to genetic predispositions, influence our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m7mJIol9S7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/i-built-it-to-break-the-rules-mit-students-pocket-sized-3d-printer-creates-complex-objects-in-just-seconds/"&gt;“I Built It to Break the Rules”: MIT Student’s Pocket-Sized 3D Printer Creates Complex Objects in Just Seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 peer-reviewed scientific papers already published based on this data, the UK Biobank has set a new standard for medical research. The rapid analysis of heart scans in under a second is just one example of the technological advancements made possible by this dataset. The ability to see inside the human body &lt;i&gt;“in ways that were previously impossible”&lt;/i&gt; opens new avenues for research, enabling scientists to make connections that can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Volunteers and Continuous Advancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the success of the UK Biobank’s imaging project is the role played by its volunteers. These individuals, driven by a desire to contribute to a healthier future, have collectively enabled a dataset of immense value to be compiled. Their commitment has not only enhanced our understanding of disease progression but also provided a foundation for future breakthroughs in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the dataset continues to grow, so too does its potential to transform healthcare. The integration of lifestyle and health data with imaging results creates a comprehensive picture that can inform personalized medicine approaches. The ongoing contributions from these volunteers ensure that the UK Biobank remains a pivotal resource in the quest to unravel the complexities of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project signifies a monumental stride in medical research, offering insights that promise to revolutionize disease prevention and treatment. As we continue to explore the depths of this dataset, one must wonder: how will these insights shape the future of global healthcare, and what new frontiers will we uncover next?&lt;/p&gt;

The idea that Parkinson’s could be linked to a virus had been theorized for years, but this is the first study to pinpoint a specific virus as more common in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The message that we want to give to the general public is, it opens a new field of investigation, something that we didn’t know about,” said Dr. Igor Koralnik, Northwestern’s chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder caused by the loss of neurons that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger in the brain. Why these neurons break down is unknown, but it’s thought that this breakdown is caused by many factors, both genetic and environmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used a tool called ViroFind, which is able to test samples for all known viruses that infect humans much quicker than the usual one-at-a-time “brute force” method. The lab found human pegivirus, or HPgV, in 5 of the 10 Parkinson’s-affected brains they tested, and none of the brains without Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fifty percent of any population having this virus would be very, very high,” Barbara Hanson, the lab’s post-doctoral fellow, said. Estimates calculate HPgV as being present in about 5% of blood donors in North America, and people with healthy immune systems generally lose the virus within two years of exposure. It is not known to cause disease in humans, so most who catch the virus will never know they had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this study, Hanson said, HPgV had not been found in human brain tissue. It was understood to primarily “live” in blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this virus to be present in the brain, there must be a reason for that,” Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the virus itself is a trigger for Parkinson’s, though. It could be that an as-yet unidentified genetic mutation that makes people susceptible to Parkinson’s, also allows for the virus to spread throughout the body differently than in people without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;And even if further research shows HPgV as a direct cause of Parkinson’s, both Koralnik and Dr. Danny Bega, medical director of Northwestern’s Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center, said people shouldn’t necessarily worry about getting HPgV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patient likely has to encounter a couple of different factors before they develop Parkinson’s, Bega said. He puts it in terms of “hits” — a hit could be genetic, or it could be environmental, such as exposure to a virus or pesticide. These “hits” build up over time until there are enough factors to cause the neuron degeneration specific to Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that this is why Parkinson’s risk increases with age, Bega said. The longer you live, the more of these “hits” you take, as you encounter different Parkinson’s risk factors throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always caution people who try to blame their Parkinson’s on one thing,” he said. “Rest assured, it’s never one thing that you could have done or should have done differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work to treat and hopefully one day prevent Parkinson’s is being done through finding these factors and eliminating them one by one. “The more targets that we have, the more likely we are to be able to achieve a treatment that actually can slow things down,” Bega said.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two tubs of salted butter in the snug space and another two tubs holding different varieties of salt, both of which Moore’s sous-chefs are sprinkling liberally onto roasted chickens, into pots of pasta water, and onto great wheels of chicken schnitzel that are served with tufts of salted salad on top. “It’s all about those first two bites,” Moore says. “They have to be memorable — they have to pop.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoycf00163b78hsqnvgk0@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;Moore, who has lost 80 pounds in the past two years on what he describes as a diet of “green beans and coffee,” is looking a little wistfully at the bowl of rigatoni carbonara that has been placed at the pass for his inspection before being whisked out into the crowded dining room. This sinful agglomeration of bacon, salted pork jowls, and salted butter that’s finished with clouds of salty Parm and a heavy egg yolk for good measure is one of the restaurant’s best sellers. Ditto Moore’s signature poulet rôti, a recipe he perfected years ago at a long-vanished fine-dining establishment called Montrachet after he’d ordered too many chickens for the evening service. To sell as many of the excess birds as possible, he injected a mix of herbs and salted butter under the skin, filled their salted cavities with a bread stuffing, and served the dish with a gravy made of buttery pan drippings. The chickens sold out, and he’s been featuring the dish at his restaurants ever since. “If we didn’t add a lot of seasoning to everything,” Moore says, “people would complain, that’s for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoye400173b78mw86s13l@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;If you’ve spent any time dining around town in the increasingly clamorous, pricey, TikTok-addled world of upscale big-city restaurants, you may have noticed a marked rise in the use of the favorite flavor enhancers of professional cooks everywhere. “Costs are going up, portions are getting smaller, everyone’s distracted and taking pictures, so the way you get people’s attention is to amp everything up,” says one chef, who calls this the age of “Maximum Flavor.” There seems to be more butter on everything, more umami-rich fats and oils, and ever-more salt, which was so thick on a $130 order of prime rib during a recent visit to Daniel Boulud’s opulent steakhouse, &lt;a href="https://www.latetedorbydaniel.com/"&gt;La Tête d’Or&lt;/a&gt;, that I took a couple of eager, tasty bites before quietly pushing the dish away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoyg000183b7831qgjwfu@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;In this time of Maximum Flavor, it’s not uncommon to find a $25 salad bombed with salted nuts or handfuls of crisp fried shallots, among other salt-laden goodies (the French Wedge at La Tête d’Or includes a generous garnish of smoked beef tongue). Chefs have many different tricks to achieve Maximum Flavor: Paul Carmichael sears and fries Tyrannosaurus-size pork chops at &lt;a href="https://kabawa.com/"&gt;Kabawa&lt;/a&gt;, Maxime Pradié whips a bit of liver into the chicken ragout he tosses with pasta at &lt;a href="https://www.zimmisnyc.com/"&gt;Zimmi’s&lt;/a&gt;. “Everybody knows restaurant food is more decadent than home cooking,” Moore notes. But for all the talk of celebrating seasonal Greenmarket vegetables, cooking with alternatives to recently vilified seed oils, or ditching high-fat strip steaks in favor of dry-aged branzino charred on the grill, restaurant food is not health food — and the one ingredient that chefs will never abandon is lowly table salt, which in a world filled with conspicuous hazards might just be the most conspicuous hazard of all. Anyone who eats out even a couple nights each week is probably, but unknowingly, pummeling their systems with the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoym500193b7829am7gl1@published" data-word-count="157"&gt;“Salt is the reason my doctor didn’t want me eating in restaurants,” says Andrew Friedman, who has written cookbooks with numerous prominent, salt-happy chefs and who suffers from congestive heart failure, a condition that is thankfully under control. Too much salt is a major cause of high blood pressure, which is associated with all sorts of gloomy outcomes, including cardiovascular problems, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, gastric cancer, obesity, eyesight loss, kidney failure, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, kidney stones, gout, and bloating. (Estimates suggest that excessive sodium consumption also kills up to 100,000 people per year in the U.S.) The American Heart Association considers less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium to be the “ideal” daily amount for adults, but even the FDA’s more permissive suggestion — fewer than 2,300 milligrams per day — is, by the standards of a professional kitchen, minuscule. “That’s roughly a teaspoon of salt,” Friedman says, “so you can imagine what you’re getting at a restaurant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoyoh001a3b78a13ws1fe@published" data-word-count="199"&gt;To figure out exactly how much, my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; ordered popular dishes from well-known restaurants around town and &lt;a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/article/fine-dining-low-sodium-nutrition-facts-testing.html"&gt;sent them, frozen but otherwise untouched, to a lab for testing&lt;/a&gt; and analysis. It would take about a dozen generous pinches of salt to reach that daily recommended teaspoon, and when the results came back, they showed that anyone eating a nice dinner in this town is likely eating an entire day’s worth of sodium in one sitting (or, occasionally, in one course). A meal at &lt;a href="https://www.viacarota.com/"&gt;Via Carota&lt;/a&gt; consisting of chef Rita Sodi’s sherry-and-shallot-dressed green salad, a bowl of Pecorino-laced cacio e pepe, and a few hunks of fried rabbit for the entrée clocks in at approximately 1,900 milligrams of sodium. &lt;a href="https://minettatavernny.com/"&gt;Minetta Tavern&lt;/a&gt;’s famous Black Label hamburger with caramelized onions and a tidy pile of perfect fries is 1,385 milligrams. (A serving of Fritos, for comparison, offers 170 milligrams of sodium.) Moore’s roasted chicken, designed to be split among diners, nevertheless carries over 900 milligrams, plus 1,660 more for the mashed potatoes and stuffing. Dessert, in the form of an enormous slice of devil’s-food cake at &lt;a href="https://www.claudnyc.com/"&gt;Claud&lt;/a&gt;, could mean adding nearly 1,000 more milligrams before the check is paid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoypx001b3b78gyxqykoi@published" data-word-count="183"&gt;Friedman points out that generous salting is encouraged in the cookbook realm (“to taste” is the preferred phrase) and that all cooking icons going back at least to Julia Child are proud, stout members of the Salt and Fat School. Friedman remembers being taught how to blanch vegetables at cooking school downtown and hearing the instructor cry, “Your water should taste like Coney Island!” Every great cuisine needs a measure of salty goodness to taste delicious, and in the world of gourmet cookery, nobody seasons their food as rigorously as the French. “French cooking is more tortured; there are more steps to everything,” says Moore, who was once charged with concocting up to 16 different soups each day when he worked for Boulud. “You can’t add the salt at the end of the recipe and have the same flavor — you have to season as you go, so the more steps, the more layers of flavor you’re building, the more salt.” Moore concedes that the palates of many top chefs have been blitzed by too much salt, a necessary risk of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoyy6001c3b78t0j6e5f3@published" data-word-count="198"&gt;“The deal on salt is the more of it you eat, the more you prefer, and if you’re already eating a lot of salt, you need more of it to make your food taste better” says the nutritionist Marion Nestle, who has been critical of the excess salt in restaurant and processed foods for years. Another critic is the sustainability entrepreneur Sam Kass, who rose to prominence as the health-conscious chef for the Obamas during their White House years. He says there are myriad ways to avoid salt at home, but he hasn’t seen much change in the restaurant culture. “The chef’s attitude is, ‘We could make really healthy food, but then people will go somewhere else,’” he says. “They’re not wrong. They’re trying to run their businesses and keep their employees paid.” Kass remembers being repeatedly cursed out by a sous-chef at his first fancy European restaurant job for not adding enough butter to a dish, then looking out into the dining room and realizing in the moment that “everybody looks like shit out there, everybody looks sick, everybody looks really unwell.” He quit the job soon after and stayed away from restaurant work from then on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoyzq001d3b785msjtm2v@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;If you want to avoid salt at a restaurant, the rule is don’t &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to a restaurant, because it’s more or less everywhere. Prime culprits include any pieces of meat, even “healthy” options like grilled swordfish or nicely roasted halibut, all of which get mounted with spoonfuls of salty butter during the cooking process or served with enticingly salty sauces (like Jonathan Waxman’s Italian salsa verde enriched with anchovy fillets and salt-packed capers). Potatoes in any form are salt sponges — “Don’t ever eat a potato,” one of my doctors says. “They shouldn’t be allowed in restaurants” — and so are knotty vegetables like green beans or Brussels sprouts. Moore salt-roasts his sprouts, then finishes them in a mix of vinegar, honey, and the spreadable Italian pork sausage ’nduja. “It’s a very delicious way to eat something heinous,” he says. “At home, I’d probably give them a little salt and some lemon juice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoz1e001e3b78kqt16ozf@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;Reasonable restaurants will try to accommodate requests for no salt, provided a diner asks and understands that certain items start being salted days before they’re actually cooked. And within the five boroughs, chains with 15 or more U.S. locations are required to warn customers about which of their dishes exceed the FDA’s recommended daily sodium limit. But at bespoke and critically lauded restaurants, there’s no way to know for sure. Michael F. Jacobson, co-founder of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has been fighting the food industry and the FDA to reduce sodium levels since the 1970s. (He is also sometimes credited with popularizing the term &lt;em&gt;junk food.&lt;/em&gt;) Throughout his career, he’s tested sodium levels in all types of cuisines — and it’s the same story everywhere. “We’ve found generally huge amounts of sodium in every kind of restaurant,” he says. “It’s cheap flavoring.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoz4g001f3b785s43miqd@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;Jerold Mande spent decades on public-health and food policy at the FDA and USDA, including leading the graphic design for the contemporary version of nutrition-facts labels on packaged foods. He says that, quantities aside, there’s no difference between the salt in those Fritos and the salt in the Black Label burger: “When it comes to the negative health impacts, sodium is sodium.” Mande laments that so many restaurants have been able to provide gluten-free menu options, but salt-light items remain a rarity. “I blame the industry,” he says. “They’ve convinced a lot of people that if you want your food to taste good, don’t do ‘low sodium.’” (When Mande worked on reducing sodium levels in school lunches for Barack Obama’s USDA, he heard industry complaints that the food was underseasoned. “The plan was dependent on the FDA and CDC leading the effort and setting mandatory goals to bring down sodium across society,” he says. “They just never did their part.”)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoz61001g3b784bif9xjg@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;Greg Drescher, who co-leads many of the Culinary Institute of America’s initiatives on health and sustainability, explains that higher-quality ingredients can negate the need for excess salt. “More fruits and vegetables by themselves, that would solve much of this,” he says, since they require very little sodium to taste good. “But as soon as you start saying, ‘How do we reduce the amount of sodium in a double bacon cheeseburger?,’ it’s harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzozba001h3b781xcn3ulp@published" data-word-count="167"&gt;Back in the kitchen at Cafe Commerce, chef Moore has kindly agreed to show me how he roasts two chickens from upstate — one in accordance with his famous bistro recipe and the other the way he would roast a chicken for a Sunday dinner at home. The two birds sit side by side; one of them looks slightly bloated and unwieldy, like the breast-heavy birds McDonald’s is rumored to use in its vast McNuggets-industrial complex, and the other looks like, well, a chicken. The restaurant bird has been salted on the inside; injected under the breast skin with large deposits of salty, generously herbed butter; and left to sit overnight in order for the salty enzymes to register the greatest impact. Moore doesn’t believe in brining, so the homestyle bird, meanwhile, is scattered with its first liberal dose of kosher salt (while more salt goes on the already-sodium-blasted restaurant chicken) just before both are popped into the oven for 40 or so minutes at 500 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcyzoziz001i3b78zg4xle0e@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;When they come out of the heat, Moore’s homestyle Sunday chicken looks golden brown and relatively puny next to the bronzed, cheffed-up bird. The bulging, crackly skinned bistro chicken sits in a great pool of drippings and melted butter, which one of Moore’s cooks pours in a pan and commences to sauté with onions, buttered croutons, and nuggets of foie gras, salting the recipe every step of the way. Both chickens are quartered for serving, but the home chicken is garnished with a simple lemon, while the bistro bird is paired with the deliciously fatty foie gras stuffing. Which one tastes better? Not surprisingly, in my delicate, salt-addled state, I find myself focusing on the simpler chicken, although I can’t resist the foie gras stuffing, especially the buttery, salty, comforting croutons, which I devour one after another until every one is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists can now judge how fast your whole body is aging based on a single snapshot of your brain, researchers claim in a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists, who published their findings July 1 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7391971888444674095&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00897-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fa-single-mri-can-reveal-how-quickly-youre-aging-scientists-claim" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00897-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00897-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fa-single-mri-can-reveal-how-quickly-youre-aging-scientists-claim" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have developed a benchmark of biological aging based on brain MRIs. The team says the tool can predict an individual's future risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, chronic conditions like heart disease, physical &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/frailty" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/frailty" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;frailty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our paper presents a new way of measuring how fast a person is aging at any given moment using the information available in a single brain MRI," said first author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ahmad.hariri" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ahmad.hariri" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ahmad Hariri&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. "Faster aging increases our risk for many diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and dementia," he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hariri and colleagues used data from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/about-us" target="_blank" data-url="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/about-us" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dunedin Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which followed 1,037 people from Dunedin, New Zealand, from birth to middle age. These participants, born in 1972 and 1973, periodically received 19 assessments to check the function of their heart, brain, liver, kidneys and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To develop their tool, the team analyzed the brain MRIs taken from this cohort at age 45 and ran the data about brain structure — the volume and thickness of various brain regions and the ratio of white to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32605-why-is-gray-matter-gray.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32605-why-is-gray-matter-gray.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gray matter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — through a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared the processed brain data to other data collected from the participants at the same time, such as tests of physical and cognitive decline, subjective health statuses, and signs of facial aging, like wrinkles. They asserted that bigger declines in those areas were tied to a faster pace of aging, overall, and then correlated features of the brain data to those metrics. They called their resulting model "Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from Neuroimaging," or DunedinPACNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/epigenetics-linked-to-the-maximum-life-spans-of-mammals-including-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/epigenetics-linked-to-the-maximum-life-spans-of-mammals-including-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetics linked to the maximum life spans of mammals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDh76A57tAmfyPWNRJ433" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDh76A57tAmfyPWNRJ433 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the team created a similar tool called Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73420" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73420" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DunedinPACE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That metric looked at methylation — chemical tags that attach to DNA molecules — in blood samples to estimate people's pace of aging. Methylation is a type of "epigenetic change," meaning it alters genes activity without changing DNA's underlying code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[DunedinPACE] has been widely adopted by studies with available &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37703-epigenetics.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37703-epigenetics.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;epigenetic data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," Hariri said. "DunedinPACNI now allows studies without epigenetic data but with brain MRI to measure accelerated aging." The researchers directly compared DunedinPACNI to DunedinPACE, finding that they generated similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if their new tool could be useful beyond Dunedin, the team used it to estimate the pace of aging using MRIs in other datasets: 42,000 MRIs from the U.K. Biobank; over 1,700 MRIs from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and 369 from the BrainLat set, which includes data from five South American countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Making sure our findings generalize across datasets and demographic groups is a big priority for brain imaging research," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/ethan-whitman-0" target="_blank" data-url="https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/ethan-whitman-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ethan Whitman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral student at Duke, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that DunedinPACNI could also estimate the rate of aging in these other cohorts, and that it did so as accurately as other measures used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Biobank and ADNI also include measures of specific health effects of aging, including tests of physical frailty, like grip strength and walking speed, as well as rates of heart attack, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and death from all causes within the cohorts. Using these additional measures, the team was able to link faster aging rates, as determined with DunedinPACNI, with increased risks of heart attack, stroke, COPD and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hariri believes DunedinPACNI has the potential to be widely adopted because the type of MRIs it uses are routinely collected. Now it's a matter of crunching the data and determining standards of what reflects "healthy" and "poor" aging, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that it worked well with the BrainLat data is a big win for the investigators because it supports the generalizability of the model,” said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ariadnelabs.org/profile/daniel-henderson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ariadnelabs.org/profile/daniel-henderson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Dan Henderson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved with the study. "It would still be worth looking at other data sets where genetic and other factors might be different in important ways," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson said he could see DunedinPACNI eventually being used in place of conventional health measures to fine-tune medical interventions for individual patients. Whitman also sees broad implications for the research. Assuming it's validated for use by doctors, he thinks it could help patients prepare for age-related health issues before they manifest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We were really amazed that our tool was able to predict disease risk before symptoms had started," Whitman told Live Science in an email. "We think this is a great example of why it's important to study aging in general, but especially in younger, healthy people. If you only study people after they have gotten sick, you're missing a lot of the story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body"&gt;Brain quiz&lt;/a&gt;: Test your knowledge of the most complex organ in the body&lt;/h2&gt;

Some popular peanut butter brands even boast about their protein content on their labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRPPVH4ONZGMRFUXDN3N44GRKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11022925/#s0006" target="_blank"&gt;in a report&lt;/a&gt; published in a top sports nutrition journal last year, exercise and sports nutrition scientists cautioned that peanut butter isn’t as high in protein as many people think. The report noted that peanut butter is an “energy dense” food: Ounce for ounce, it has a lot more dietary fat and calories compared with eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats, chicken breast, beans, fish and other high-protein foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHASUYW6CJAMPKFTSOMWTRJTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Peanut butter is certainly nutritious. It contains &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/14/high-fiber-meal-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. But it contains at least twice as many grams of fat as protein. You should consider it a great source of fat, rather than a great source of protein, said Jose Antonio, an author of the report and a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VME3BIY6YFC25IYWPNMQEPYGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you read the nutrition label on any jar of peanut butter, you will see that it’s mostly fat,” said Antonio, who is also the chief executive of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XH2J4HCF6RDUZCUNWCYPZQZYYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two tablespoons of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;creamy peanut butter — the amount in one serving, or one ounce — has about seven grams of protein, 16 grams of fat and 190 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFNDUEGEFNA6JO77UA7FF7BHFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the report noted that people who use peanut butter to help them meet their protein needs should consider eating it in moderation because of its high &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/13/weight-loss-calories-fiber-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;calorie&lt;/a&gt; density. Otherwise, the authors warned, they may be setting themselves up for “unintentional weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TC334XRZABHF3CC7P3T2KLA4HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Peanut butter is a healthy food, but calories still matter,” Antonio said. “If you want to gain weight, eat a bunch of peanut butter.

It is also used off-label to treat other health issues, including low back pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past studies have also found that using gabapentin may increase a person’s risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study reports that people who receive six or more prescriptions of gabapentin for lower back pain are at a higher risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found these risks were more than doubled in adults between the ages of 35 to 49 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all medications, gabapentin has some potential side effects, including dizziness, tiredness, water retention, and dry mouth.

They also categorized study participants into different age groups: 18–64, 18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and 65 or older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, there is a discrepancy on whether taking gabapentin increases a patient’s risk for developing dementia,” &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMyxOfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/a&gt;, a 4th-year medical student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH, and first author of this study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there lacks a strong understanding of how gabapentin impacts cognitive function and whether it contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Previous studies have shown mixed findings on this topic. Thus, we decided to explore this gap in the field,” explained Eghrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, researchers found that study participants who received six or more gabapentin prescriptions had a 29% higher risk of developing dementia, and an 85% greater chance of being diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The significance of this finding is an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia on a nationwide level,” Eghrari explained. “Though this does not imply causation, this warrants further investigation on the drug’s long-term effects.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of clinical significance, I recommend that physicians prescribing gabapentin for chronic pain perform cognitive exams on a regular basis when seeing patients,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d also advise patients who are taking this drug to alert their physician if they notice any cognitive deficits, including confusion, poor memory, or slowed thinking,” said the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eghrari and his team also discovered that when looking at participants by age groups, the risks for dementia more than doubled and more than tripled for MCI in people who were 35 to 49 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find this relatively higher risk in the non-elderly population,” Eghrari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that gabapentin may have a greater cognitive impact on non-elderly individuals, as elderly individuals are already at risk for neurodegeneration due to their older age. This finding warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanism of how gabapentin may impact cognition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway of this study is that patients prescribed gabapentin for chronic back pain should be closely monitored by their physician for cognitive decline,” he continued. “Moreover, gabapentin should be prescribed with caution due to the associated risk of dementia/cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to carry this research forward and explore whether there is a true causative relationship between gabapentin and cognitive impairment,” Eghrari added. “We also plan to investigate the underlying mechanisms of how the drug may impact cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://infospine.net/meet-dr-anand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Neel Anand&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MCh Orth, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon and director of the Cedars-Sinai Spine Center in Los Angeles, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anand, who was not involved in the research, commented that there are pros and cons to studies with big data sets as there are many variables and it is hard to determine the true causative factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, little or no information was provided on any other illnesses participants may have had or other medications they were taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best thing I would take from the study is […] [that] there’s not a single drug without a side effect — they all have some issues,” Anand pointed out. “So the answer is, if you’re chronically going to take something, you better watch out — something’s [potentially] going to go wrong somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anand said the best way to prove anything is to take a cohort of study participants who take a specific medication and nothing else, and compare them to another cohort who does not take the medication. And researchers need to ensure that participants take the medication if it is prescribed to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that, in some cases, patients do not follow the doctor’s indications regarding prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they do more, sometimes they’ll take less,“ Anand said. “The only way to actually study [the real-life effects of long-term drug use] would be to literally take a thousand people and give them gabapentin and nothing else, and a thousand you don’t, and then follow them over 5 years or more,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he admitted that “at least we can be cognizant“ that there may be a heightened risk of dementia with prolonged gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is “a possibility that [doctors] needs to be aware [of] or at least counsel our patients [on] — that’s fair,” Anand added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:20:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQaG5DYUV0cU1qREE2YnZnMXRmYTFkZnl0ZUNVeGxWVGtTUTZQclAzRTZPQWhUNWdJWkNxMGxOX2t5a1B1UThjU3d4bU5heWxJMUNXUHgtRmptN25OdVVJeGotN0pTZjJEWU1GRk1fUkdaY3o4TzZtLWRBdUJkVk1VWkhidk1xeGEzcUZneEo5SGVWRjF0QmxNLU9ObXE3T2Z1cGxtV25HeW5pUQ</guid></item><item><title>即使是健康的大脑也会随着年龄的增长而衰退。以下是您可以做的事情-美国国家公共广播电台 | Even healthy brains decline with age.

                Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people," says &lt;a href="https://www.tgen.org/faculty-profiles/matt-huentelman/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Huentelman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman should know. He helps run &lt;a href="https://mindcrowd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;MindCrowd&lt;/a&gt;, a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was "exceptional," meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/" target="_blank"&gt;McKnight Brain Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To preserve cognitive function in later life, "we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level," says &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/the-mcknight-brain-research-foundation-announces-alice-luo-clayton-phd-as-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice Luo Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another speaker was &lt;a href="https://mbi-umiami.org/lab-member/christian-agudelo-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Agudelo&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12250" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep stages&lt;/a&gt;, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile," he says. "You feel refreshed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can "being active, both socially and physically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those behaviors increase "sleep pressure," the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, "we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/639/charles-decarli---neurology---dementia---alzheimer-s-disease-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles DeCarli&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But &lt;a href="https://diversevcid.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?" he says. "And the answer seems to be yes."&lt;/p&gt;

The factors include not smoking, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/health/mediterranean-diet-shopping-list-printable-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutritious diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular exercise, a healthy weight, optimal blood pressure, controlled blood sugar and well-managed cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed 483 studies on the impacts of maximizing Life’s Simple 7 on the health of many different body systems over the course of people’s lives in a meta-analysis published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038566" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining ideal levels of at least three of Life’s Simple 7 metrics was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, even if someone had a genetic predisposition, according to the data. And better scores across all of the factors showed benefits in many body systems beyond cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A few years ago, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/health/heart-dementia-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health and brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health and brain health&lt;/a&gt; are very closely tied. Through this review, we found that almost every organ system and bodily function also benefits from maintaining the healthy lifestyle behaviors of Life’s Simple 7,” said lead study author Dr. Liliana Aguayo, a research assistant professor at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and the Global Diabetes Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were pleasantly surprised to find that Life’s Simple 7 at optimal levels touched every aspect of health, from head to toe. It goes well beyond just cardiovascular health to encompass whole-body health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating plant-based foods can help heart health, said Dr. Nour Makarem of Columbia University. - FG Trade/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It doesn’t take much to see the benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a systemic review of studies that followed a gold standard approach, said Dr. Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology and co-leader of the Chronic Disease Unit at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. Makarem was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant findings of the research is that a little change makes a big difference when it comes to lifestyle and health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study assessed adherence to Life’s Simple 7 using a scale from 0 to 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each improvement by 1 point was associated with an 11% decrease in dementia risk, a 6% decreased risk of eye disease, a 23% decreased risk of fatty liver disease, and an 11% decreased risk of chronic kidney disease, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that small changes, for example, moving from obesity to overweight, adding any physical activity even if below recommended levels counted as progress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the studies showed an adherence to Life’s Simple 7 was associated with maintaining brain and lung function, vision and hearing, and teeth and muscle strength over the course of aging, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The essential 8 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies included in the meta-analysis used Life’s Simple 7 to evaluate lifestyle behaviors, but the AHA has since updated the metrics to Life’s Essential 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines are more comprehensive, such as including avoiding secondhand smoke, vaping and nicotine products in the not smoking factor and pointing people to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/mediterranean-diet-cancer-prevention-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/health/best-diets-heart-aha-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; under the healthy eating metric, Makarem said. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the update added an eighth metric that recognizes the role of sleep in long-term health, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep means seven to nine hours a night for most adults, 10 to 16 hours for children ages 5 and younger, 9 to 12 hours for kids ages 6 to 12, and 8 to 10 hours for adolescents ages 13 to 18, according to the AHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that adopting a healthy lifestyle is important to achieve optimal health as well as managing the conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease –– weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Even adding a little bit of exercise can help. - Oleg Breslavtsev/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes make a big difference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday lifestyle choices have a big impact on overall health, and it’s worth it to take steps toward better cardiovascular health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key message is that it is never too early or too late to make small, feasible changes,” she said in an email. “Small improvements in diet, physical activity, smoking, or managing risk factors (weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar) can have meaningful benefits, not just for heart health, but for all the body, from head to toe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a heart-healthy diet, Makarem recommends focusing on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains and consuming lean proteins such as fish. She also recommended limiting processed foods, sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity — like walking, dancing or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/the-best-garden-tools?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gardening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gardening&lt;/a&gt; — or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week, Makarem added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even considering how impactful small changes can be, ideal cardiovascular health is very rare –– with less than 4% of people worldwide meeting the criteria, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must do more to support young people, especially women, by making it easier, more affordable, and achievable for all to improve their cardiovascular health,” she added. “Cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer of women. Supporting the heart health of young people and women is both cost-effective and the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/a&gt;.

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE53dzc4LXUwSmlGalJMa0Z0MnE2LUU1aFJCZEIyUXJfMklUQnQ0NWF5bFBlVUdEMDJsTlMxaHdacjhDYjI2VjZYdlFYVDdNZk84TmpxN3VjT3EyRkJsaUhxLVRVY05BZjEySGVsQkxESmZKa1hoQTdneTUwRmp0RUU</guid></item><item><title>我用来让孩子倾听的1个平静短语-雅虎 | The 1 calming phrase I use to get my kids to listen - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQeDBBRnpGanpqOHZNNzQwZDUxeWJic3RlMk1PVktzbUJnODRvQ3NpVHhvX3g4dGdtUk81ZThRSG9Bc1cxcFJRSkl6aThzNlhkaGpSVDlOZkNGRnU2a3lVX09tVjlJUnA3bFNWblI3VWZxZmNkbWhWUWpwV1hKb0xtbFU4WlVnV0NrdjVQQVI1UGYyajhKdGdZdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being a parent often means feeling like a broken record.

But there are other, more effective ways to handle things when your kids don’t seem to hear you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the eighth episode of their podcast, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-lifestyle&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=4ae9a3a0-3fc1-47b8-8bef-571082f15848&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=After+Bedtime+With+Big+Little+Feelings&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BvZGNhc3RzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9wb2RjYXN0L2FmdGVyLWJlZHRpbWUtd2l0aC1iaWctbGl0dGxlLWZlZWxpbmdzL2lkMTcwNTI4NjMzOSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGFlOWEzYTAtM2ZjMS00N2I4LThiZWYtNTcxMDgyZjE1ODQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BvZGNhc3RzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9wb2RjYXN0L2FmdGVyLWJlZHRpbWUtd2l0aC1iaWctbGl0dGxlLWZlZWxpbmdzL2lkMTcwNTI4NjMzOSJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAASB5vXJ7MB3OD-dJVKv3cdNU3_4C2YSphc8xfyYGm8Jf&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fafter-bedtime-with-big-little-feelings%2Fid1705286339&amp;amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Farticle%2F1-calming-phrase-kids-listen-090047300.html" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:After Bedtime With Big Little Feelings;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Bedtime With Big Little Feelings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-lifestyle&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=4ae9a3a0-3fc1-47b8-8bef-571082f15848&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=Big+Little+Feelings&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2JpZ2xpdHRsZWZlZWxpbmdzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRhZTlhM2EwLTNmYzEtNDdiOC04YmVmLTU3MTA4MmYxNTg0OCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9iaWdsaXR0bGVmZWVsaW5ncy5jb20vIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAeG7NkG-tnEGHoHel08jdzJ-vV_QiISPF_-8ZEXNpE2L&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbiglittlefeelings.com%2F&amp;amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Farticle%2F1-calming-phrase-kids-listen-090047300.html" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Big Little Feelings;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Little Feelings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; founders Deena Margolin, a child therapist specializing in interpersonal neurobiology, and Kristin Gallant, a parenting coach with a background in maternal and child education, shed some light on what parents often get wrong about kids’ ability to listen and why it can be triggering when it seems like your child is ignoring you. In this edition of Yahoo’s "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/after-after-bedtime-the-parenting-experts-behind-big-little-feelings-are-here-to-help-231102104.html" data-ylk="slk:After After Bedtime;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;After After Bedtime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;" column, Margolin shares the key phrase she uses to get her kids to listen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening is not the same as hearing. Just because your child heard you say, “Put on your shoes,” doesn’t mean their brain has the skills to stop what they’re doing, shift gears, hold the request in their working memory and actually follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are executive functioning skills — and they’re housed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is only 25% developed by age 3 and still under construction into the mid-20s. So when we expect a 4-year-old to “listen the first time,” we’re essentially expecting a flip phone to operate like an iPhone 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not listening does not equal disrespect. Most of the time, it’s dysregulation (they’re overwhelmed), distraction (they’re in the zone) or developmental immaturity (their brain literally isn’t there yet). The takeaway? Listening is a skill, not a character trait. It’s built over time through modeling, connection, co-regulation and repetition — not through punishment or yelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="why-is-it-so-triggering-when-our-kids-dont-listen-and-how-can-parents-stay-calm-instead-of-reactive"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it so triggering when our kids don’t listen, and how can parents stay calm instead of being reactive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your child ignores you for the third time, it’s not just about the moment. It taps into something deeper. It can feel like, “They’re not respecting me,” “I must be failing as a parent” or “No one listens to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These thoughts activate our own nervous system, especially if we weren’t listened to or respected as kids or if we were punished harshly for “not listening.” That’s why the first step isn’t even about your child — it’s about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try this when you feel that surge of anger rise up: Put your hand on your chest. Take a breath and say, “I’m safe. I’m a good parent. My child’s brain is still developing.” It sounds simple, but that pause interrupts your stress response and brings your thinking brain back online so you can respond instead of react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="whats-one-surprisingly-effective-phrase-that-builds-real-cooperation-with-your-kids"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one surprisingly effective phrase that builds real cooperation with your kids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One phrase that’s been gold in my house: “Let’s do it together.” When I see one of my kids spinning out, ignoring me or avoiding the task, instead of demanding compliance, I lean into connection: “Need help starting?” “Let’s race to the shoes!” “Should we do the first step together and then you finish?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason this works is simple neuroscience: Connection regulates the brain. Regulation opens the mind. An open mind is capable of cooperation. The goal is never perfect obedience. It’s building real skills — focus, flexibility, follow-through — through a foundation of safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tools I love and use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get into their world.&lt;/strong&gt; Before you ask them to enter your world (put shoes on, clean up, come to dinner), enter theirs — even just for 10 seconds. This might look like narrating what they’re doing: “Whoa, you’re building a giant spaceship!” Or offering playful connection: “Can your astronaut help me blast off to the bathroom for teeth brushing?” Here’s why it works: It helps their brain shift gears with less resistance. You’re not dragging them out of a flow state — you’re inviting them into connection first. This signals safety, which opens the door to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it short and positive.&lt;/strong&gt; Skip the lecture. Give the instruction in five words or fewer, and tell them what &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; do instead of what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do. “Walking feet.” “Hands stay to yourself.” “Shoes on, please.” Why it works: Their developing brain can only process so much at once. Short, clear cues reduce feelings of being overwhelmed and keep their nervous system calm enough to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it concrete and visual.&lt;/strong&gt; If you find yourself repeating the same instructions over and over, make it visual. Create a morning routine chart with pictures, a simple checklist with drawings or photos, or a timer or hourglass to show how long until you leave the house. Why it works: Visuals reduce verbal overload, increase independence and help kids see what’s expected, which is especially helpful for neurodivergent kids or during transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="final-thought"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your child listens 25% of the time and their brain is only 25% developed, that math actually checks out. It doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong. It means you’re parenting a human, not a robot. And the more you understand the brain behind the behavior, the less you take it personally and the more powerful you become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:00:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQeDBBRnpGanpqOHZNNzQwZDUxeWJic3RlMk1PVktzbUJnODRvQ3NpVHhvX3g4dGdtUk81ZThRSG9Bc1cxcFJRSkl6aThzNlhkaGpSVDlOZkNGRnU2a3lVX09tVjlJUnA3bFNWblI3VWZxZmNkbWhWUWpwV1hKb0xtbFU4WlVnV0NrdjVQQVI1UGYyajhKdGdZdQ</guid></item><item><title>寻找无宿醉的嗡嗡声-彭博社 | The Quest for a Hangover-Free Buzz - Bloomberg</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQR3pTb2U0WXFoVk12b1ZNWDNXYmR3clQxNVgxZHlJLTNOMWJGYmxPZ0VuTlVYdEp1aElleGZLTFIzZmRPeTEtUXlKbmVRY1RZX1ZDS2J4U2I5Mld1MzdlWXl5Q3pnckdmRzlsTUtjSnEtSHJEZjltRkNBYW5FbnZTakh6bWcxT21mMDZKOW54cmpRRkRfcll0eGZBQzI3ZHk2cXctUEotQ3l5UkRhd09kSEYzcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_body__G_0n2"&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.nutt" title="David Nutt Profile | Imperial College London" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;David Nutt&lt;/a&gt; is an accomplished professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, but he hasn’t always been great at reading a room. In 2009 he was the UK government’s top adviser on drugs, a key voice on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs" title="A collection of the council's reports." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;a council tasked with recommending changes to the nation’s drug policies&lt;/a&gt;. That was until he argued that the field’s greatest challenge, the substance responsible for the most widespread harm, was alcohol. While this would have been considered heresy in many societies, it proved to be an especially untenable position in Britain. He was asked to resign from his government post two days after he shared his views with the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;All these years later, Nutt is quick to clarify that he appreciates the upside of drinking. “Most people meet their partners with the help of alcohol,” he says. “It promotes sociability, and there’s not much else like it.” What he’s been after, he says, is a safer, healthier way to approximate the buzz of booze—something that can deliver the fun bits and skip the addiction, the cirrhosis, the sloppy aggro nonsense. By the time he was on the government council, research had made clear that the root of many problems with alcohol was its neurological complexity, that the good parts were intertwined with the bad ones. Once Nutt had more time on his hands, he decided to try making his own molecule, one that could give him the fuzzy feelings of a couple glasses of wine and leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bloomberg</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQR3pTb2U0WXFoVk12b1ZNWDNXYmR3clQxNVgxZHlJLTNOMWJGYmxPZ0VuTlVYdEp1aElleGZLTFIzZmRPeTEtUXlKbmVRY1RZX1ZDS2J4U2I5Mld1MzdlWXl5Q3pnckdmRzlsTUtjSnEtSHJEZjltRkNBYW5FbnZTakh6bWcxT21mMDZKOW54cmpRRkRfcll0eGZBQzI3ZHk2cXctUEotQ3l5UkRhd09kSEYzcw</guid></item><item><title>肿瘤学家需要将抗菌素耐药性视为癌症护理提供危机- STAT | Oncologists need to see antimicrobial resistance as a cancer care delivery crisis - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxObm91X0hTTFJ5OUFZT0R2QldlTlBYdC16Qy1FY21nVm5WWXdEOGxEVjBGMTNtT3JHM0d0SUlZVUV4QmtIZGZOVFJrYm1IZW1iLUM0bldfTDhMdjlMX3RwSEVoeElLcV9MOWFhSmQxbHVUeG51TE15aGw3aFpIeWRjaFFoN2dGUWxkbGhJUmpiX0tOMkROc0hEbnp1MXk2bGNicVFfVVJZTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a medical oncologist, one of the first threats I inform new patients about during the informed consent process for cancer treatment is how vulnerable they now are to infections. Cancer weakens the immune system, and common therapies on which we rely, such as chemotherapy, further diminish the body’s ability to protect itself from infections. An upper respiratory infection might be an inconvenience for a healthy adult. For an immunocompromised person living with cancer, it could be fatal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t understand how important antibiotics are to cancer care. My entire ability to treat a patient’s cancer is predicated on the idea that antibiotics will both cure and prevent opportunistic bacterial infections throughout their course of care. It is no exaggeration when I say that antibiotics have helped nearly every cancer patient whom I have successfully cared for during their hospital admission for complications of their cancer or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, when I was invited to be part of a joint task force and research team focused on antimicrobial resistance among cancer patients, I hesitated. My first thought was, “That’s not a cancer specialist’s problem, that’s an infectious disease problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, colloquially known as “superbugs,” are a fast-emerging global threat that are now associated with more than &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00876-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;4.5 million deaths annually&lt;/a&gt;. They cause complex infections that cannot be treated with standard antibiotics, and they are more common in immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern medicine, but there’s very little discussion so far of what it means for cancer care. Part of the problem is that in the hyper-specialized worlds of medicine and health policy, superbugs are the remit of infectious disease specialists while cancer occupies the realm of non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on how dependent my patients are on antibiotics, I stepped out of my silo and joined the research team. What we have found is alarming and should serve as a wake-up call to oncologists everywhere to join the global fight against antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our first study, published in &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39673173/__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!LlL5ZS4mJdElE7G7rOX85Tf-_aMHQc7aJCIG2N7mlSRJs3QsJHbTSdo146aWJy3eIQBUNc4Nybkq4U90Ai14zEakD2k8oVQ3bbOsw6M%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cancer Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, examined data from more than 4 million admissions across 168 hospitals in the U.S. and found that hospitalized cancer patients were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to have an antibiotic-resistant infection compared with hospitalized patients who did not have cancer. Several of the drug-resistant bacteria for which cancer patients were at increased risk, according to our study, have been flagged by the World Health Organization as “priority pathogens,” meaning they pose a notable threat to global public health, and there are few new drugs in development against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our second study, recently published in &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00128-7/fulltext__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!LlL5ZS4mJdElE7G7rOX85Tf-_aMHQc7aJCIG2N7mlSRJs3QsJHbTSdo146aWJy3eIQBUNc4Nybkq4U90Ai14zEakD2k8oVQ3fUJ8ODU%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lancet Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, we observed a similar elevated risk in the outpatient setting. In our analysis of more than 1.5 million bacterial isolates collected from 198 outpatient facilities in the U.S., we found that rates for antimicrobial resistance among priority pathogens were up to 3 times higher in cancer patients compared with non-cancer patients who received care in the outpatient setting; for the multidrug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the rate was five times greater among patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also of concern is that our data showed that cancer patients had significantly higher rates of infections caused by bacteria that were resistant to a class of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones. That’s troubling, as the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend prophylactically administering fluoroquinolones when patients have an elevated risk of developing neutropenia, a complication that results in reduced numbers of specific white blood cells, and is a relatively common side effect associated with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Superbugs and cancer are both global challenges that disproportionately affect those in low- and middle-income countries, and the dangerous synergies our studies identified between cancer and antibiotic resistance are likely amplified many times over in countries with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are basic precautions we can take to mitigate the threat. Clinicians, patients, and their families need to adhere to infection control and prevention guidelines, as well as recommended immunization guidelines. Handwashing, disinfecting shared surfaces, and vigilantly monitoring for symptoms of an infection are some of the best ways to protect vulnerable patients from infections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Governments and drugmakers also need to work toward revitalizing research and development into new antibiotics and faster, more precise diagnostics for bacterial infections. There are approximately &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330420/9789240000193-eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;50 new antibiotic candidates&lt;/a&gt; in clinical development compared with more than &lt;a href="https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/global-oncology-trends-2024#:~:text=More%20than%202%2C000%20new%20oncology,multispecific%20antibodies%2C%20and%20radioligand%20therapies." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1,500 cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; and vaccine candidates in development. Without effective antibiotics, we’ll never fully reap the benefits of immunotherapies, precision medicines, and other recent advances in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, cancer providers need to speak up and spotlight the threat antibiotic-resistant infections pose to our patients. Treatment guidelines pertaining to antibiotic-resistant infections among cancer patients continue to lag. The most recent American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Practice Guideline Update for management of neutropenic fever in adult cancer patients was in &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.77.6211" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;. Very few cancer societies address, let alone prioritize, antibiotic resistance as a global public health crisis to promote with their members. And there is scant published research on antibiotic resistance and its current and long-term implications for cancer care; the research that does exist tends to be in infectious disease journals, not oncology journals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cancer patient and an infectious disease patient are often the same person, and our siloed systems artificially bifurcate how clinicians approach each ailment. A holistic approach to the care of our patients requires that we equally advocate for newer cancer therapies at the same time as we join the fight against antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urgently need to build an evidence base that can better inform how we care for our patients in the age of superbugs, and we need to draw on experts from across disciplines to develop strategies for educating patients on this emerging risk. In other words, we need to step out of our silos.&lt;/p&gt;

The first weeks of medical school are brutal — students struggling not just with their coursework but with the sheer adjustment to the relentless pace of their new reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emily (not her real name) was one of those students. Coming from an engineering background, she had never encountered microbiology beyond the minimal exposure provided by the MCAT. Within days of starting medical school, she was drowning. Concepts like bacterial structures, viral replication, and antimicrobial mechanisms weren’t just new — they were foreign, making it nearly impossible for her to grasp the foundations of infection-related pathology and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And she’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical schools require biology, chemistry, physics, and sometimes advanced biochemistry or genetics. But one critical subject is missing from that list: microbiology. Without it, students like Emily enter medical school at a disadvantage, scrambling to understand pathogens, antibiotics, and infectious diseases while trying to keep pace with a curriculum that assumes they already have this knowledge. Medical schools must make microbiology a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pathogens behind infectious diseases is fundamental to medicine. A future physician must know bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites — their structures, replication processes, and virulence factors — to accurately diagnose, treat, and manage infections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Consider bacterial cell walls. Knowing their composition determines which antibiotics will work and why some bacteria develop resistance. Without this knowledge, prescribing antibiotics becomes guesswork — a dangerous game in an era of rising antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to assume microbiology matters only for infectious disease specialists, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Every field of medicine — from surgery to oncology to cardiology — relies on microbiological knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgeons must understand microbial flora to prevent postoperative infections. Oncologists must account for a patient’s microbiota when administering monoclonal antibody treatments. Cardiologists managing endocarditis rely on microbiological principles to tailor treatment strategies. Microbiology isn’t a niche topic — it’s foundational.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance, medical schools often dedicate only a few weeks to microbiology, leaving students underprepared for clinical applications. This gap becomes glaringly obvious after the second year of medical school. That’s when students reach their Step 1 board exams, where microbiology makes up &lt;a href="https://www.usmle.org/exam-resources/step-1-materials/step-1-content-outline-and-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;10-20%&lt;/a&gt; of the content. Suddenly, they’re expected to master a subject they barely covered — often resorting to rote memorization instead of deep understanding. Why are we forcing students to learn critical knowledge in a panic instead of giving them the foundation they need from the start?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not just about making sure students who are clearly talented can graduate from medical school. It’s also about making sure that they are able to practice effectively once they do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine. As pathogens evolve, physicians must stay ahead, understanding the mechanisms of resistance — enzyme production, drug target modification, efflux pumps, and more. Yet current medical curricula barely scratch the surface of these topics. Ensuring a strong microbiological foundation must begin before students even set foot in medical school.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 made one thing clear: Understanding microbiology is non-negotiable. The rapid emergence of new pathogens, the complexities of viral replication, and the global nature of infectious diseases demand that physicians enter the field prepared. Yet, with limited microbiology training, are we truly equipping them to handle the next pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every year, students like Emily struggle — not because they lack intelligence or dedication, but because they weren’t given the foundational knowledge they needed before medical school. When Emily started preparing for Step 1, she was shocked at how much microbiology dominated the exam. If she had taken microbiology before medical school, her coursework and board preparation would have been far less stressful and far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical schools have the power to fix this. By making microbiology a prerequisite, they can ensure that incoming students possess the critical knowledge necessary to succeed from day one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This change isn’t just about making medical school easier — it’s about making future doctors better. A stronger foundation in microbiology means better clinical decision-making, improved patient care, and a more prepared medical workforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical education must evolve. And the first step? Start small — start with microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;C.A. Tolchinsky, Ed.D., is a medical education learning specialist at Nova Southeastern University College of Allopathic Medicine. Bryn Tolchinsky, M.S., is a senior scientist at Eli Lilly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog parents need to take care of their furry friends’ needs, whether it be big or small. Apart from meals and medicine, owners also need to make their playtime as engaging as possible for their canine companions. A recent clip on social media captured a similar moment, with the pet parents doing something unique for their pups’ pool time. The video shows a pack of &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retrievers&lt;/a&gt; going wild over their new pool floatie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retrievers-take-turns-to-enjoy-their-new-pool-floatie-in-fun-video"&gt;Golden Retrievers take turns to enjoy their new pool floatie in fun video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A user, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoldensloanes/?e=122f8907-406b-42cb-bf6f-839f3b845877&amp;amp;g=5"&gt;@thegoldensloanes&lt;/a&gt;, recently took to Instagram to share the playful pool time of their pack of dogs. The account is dedicated to posting the adorable moments of the furry babies. In the latest video, the Golden Retrievers get a new pool floatie for their swimming sessions. The pups are immediately drawn to the brand-new item, leading to a memorable pool time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Instagram Reel begins with the dog mom offering the floatie to the dogs, and later, she helps the canines get on top of the same to enjoy the pool in a different way from how they were used to. One by one, the Goldens start jumping into the water and take a look at their new toy. Soon, the owner finds one of the dogs, named Scout, chilling on the floatie and realizes that she really likes it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog mom then suggests getting Shoni on the floatie. As a result, the pup is carefully put on the same, and she seems to enjoy it as well while receiving some head scratches from her dad. The pet parents are moved by her cute expressions as they write, “Look at that adorable face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theo and Brady also enjoy the floatie. In the meantime, one of the dogs does a sideways belly flop into the pool, leaving the parents in splits. The dog owners are left satisfied with their pack’s floating experience. They took the opportunity to thank the commenter who first recommended the pool floatie to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They expressed their feelings on the caption, “We finally got a floatie… and gave every dog their turn. Safe to say it was a hit!.” They added, “Huge thanks to the commenter who suggested this exact floatie. You nailed it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
