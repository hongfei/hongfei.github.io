    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15xkcd006o26nkbj3j4emt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000b356nwyypmzry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fehbs&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7Cc69cf664776b4c40810908de100dc423%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638965848813438983%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=IniV8PEDIsA5e3qIr0csq9UENlHcJO0on2bkGaZXtzI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Employer Health Benefits Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000c356n3krydd27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000d356n9k9f6erz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/health/weight-loss-drug-insurance-denials/index.html"&gt;limited Americans’ access&lt;/a&gt; to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000e356n474nvlle@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000f356n456eun78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000g356n8fnvp1z6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000h356n8j6boi8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; place last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000i356nzh04gyih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000j356nk42d22xt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/ozempic-trump-oz"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000k356n1wgxwp3o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000l356nweh83jjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000m356nq90t3bsg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000n356n05wwvanj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000o356n7431ymgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000q356nsp2gk5xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000r356nawov76si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000s356nfkh0ly5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000t356nvlscox5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000u356njd36arps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/business/health-insurance-premiums-cost-increase"&gt;coverage for 2026&lt;/a&gt; could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000v356ncdv3zyr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

As well as changing the way someone’s body looks on the surface, the results show that feminizing hormones have impacts at a molecular level, with implications for susceptibility to various health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by scientists at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) in Victoria, Australia, included 40 adult trans women receiving one of two common forms of gender-affirming hormone treatment: estradiol, coupled with either cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suite of 5,279 blood proteins was examined before starting treatment and after six months. The proteins from the participants were also compared against &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hidden-changes-to-us-health-data-swapping-gender-for-sex-spark-fears-for-public-trust-79894" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from cisgender women taken from the UK Biobank, a long-running study of 500,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the researchers discovered was that over time, receiving hormones caused protein changes in the trans women that made them more closely align with those in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sex-and-gender-operate-differently-in-the-brain-finds-study-of-nearly-5000-kids-75133" target="_blank"&gt;cisgender women&lt;/a&gt;. Of the top 100 proteins that normally differ between males and females, 36 and 22, respectively, shifted towards the “female” form in the trans women after either hormone regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were similar to what is seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/menopause-misconceptions-what-actually-causes-the-symptoms-of-menopause-63920" target="_blank"&gt;menopausal&lt;/a&gt; women who receive &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-drugs-heart-health-and-chimpanzees-heres-the-latest-in-menopause-research-76493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For transgender women we found gender affirming hormone therapy alters the levels of many protein biomarkers that reflect what happens clinically,” explained senior author and MCRI Associate Professor Boris Novakovic in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may go onto impact the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect more females, but decrease the risk of heart disease, more commonly seen in males. This highlights that human biology is malleable and that even in adulthood, our bodies respond to sex hormone changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as decreases in some protein biomarkers linked to male reproduction, there were also increases in proteins involved in body fat, breast development, immune function, and good heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in proteins linked to sperm formation was particularly notable in the group receiving cyproterone, which was put down to the fact that this particular combination treatment causes a greater drop in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could have implications for how transgender people receiving hormones are monitored over the long term. Novakovic said that as well as considering aspects of health that are unique to trans women, it’s important that providers recognize that trans women may also face similar health challenges to cisgender women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally, these findings could help optimize hormone therapy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying proteins could help with the development of personalised treatment approaches by monitoring the effectiveness of gender affirming hormone therapy in trans women and help us with early detection of potential side-effects on heart health or immune function,” explained co-author Professor Ada Cheung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was relatively small and only looked at feminizing gender-affirming hormones, so more research will be needed to assess whether similar changes may be seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/gender-affirming-mastectomies-have-an-overwhelmingly-low-regret-rate-70184" target="_blank"&gt;transgender men&lt;/a&gt; or non-binary individuals receiving masculinizing hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been established that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/male-and-female-mammals-have-different-pain-receptors-and-we-dont-know-why-74613" target="_blank"&gt;biological sex&lt;/a&gt; affects the risk of certain diseases – females are more prone to autoimmune conditions, but males are more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases, for example. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is an &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hormone-therapy-in-teens-associated-with-better-mental-health-for-transgender-people-62209" target="_blank"&gt;important treatment&lt;/a&gt; for many trans and non-binary people experiencing gender dysphoria, so a better understanding of how it impacts the body – even down to the molecular level – is vital to protect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/genderaffirming-hormone-therapy-is-not-bad-for-young-hearts-new-study-reports-59767" target="_blank"&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt; of this patient population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04023-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:07:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPaFc1NERqTElhdmdMcHBuWi1HUmFZNGpXRUZGaXNpRFkyLXg2cFNaVEhEdDNpMnplbXZ6ZDNhbUdwcC15Q1BZOU91anRVMlpOZkNZUmpiQVZBWTdOb3FXM1NaQUtnblpoQXpMMlZCcXhrZDVXVi16V1BYejhWY1pSLU9rZ2tBeXljREF1bVkweVA1bzhqZ0ZWWmNSRDhuY3RCbTRILWk5WTFYS3RNUDZZang3QkQwMTg1eHJJMVNOblRGZG5L</guid></item><item><title>灰色头发的人，快乐！灰色可能与天然癌症防御有关- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/gray-haired-people-rejoice-the-gray-might-be-related-to-a-natural-cancer-defense-2000675051</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While graying hair might feel like just one more unpleasant symptom of aging, new research reveals that it may actually be the result of a biological process that defends against cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a study led by the University of Tokyo and published earlier this month in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used lab mice to investigate how a type of stem cell reacts to DNA damage, revealing a connection between hair graying and a form of skin cancer called melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;DNA damage, aging, and cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our body’s cells are continuously faced with internal and environmental agents that can cause DNA damage, which plays a role in both aging and cancer. Scientists have struggled to pin down the specifics of this role, especially how damaged stem cells impact tissue health in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117"&gt;Stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are cells that can self-renew (make more of themselves) and differentiate (turn into other cells). Within this context, the team specifically analyzed melanocyte stem cells (McSCs)—stem cells that produce mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give color to hair and skin. In mammals, McSCs live in hair follicles in the form of immature melanoblasts (melanocytes’ precursors), where they perpetuate pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, McSCs permanently differentiate and are then lost, which results in graying—a process called seno-differentiation. However, when McSCs come into contact with some carcinogens, they maintain their ability to self-renew and expand clonally. Simply put, they avoid seno-differentiation even when DNA is damaged, pushing McSCs “toward a tumor-prone fate,” according to a University of Tokyo &lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates—exhaustion or expansion—depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” Emi Nishimura, lead author of the study and a biologist at the University of Tokyo, said in the statement. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Two potential fates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, both results may come from how McSCs react to DNA damage, when they can go one of two ways—differentiate and leave the system (which leads to graying) or carry on dividing, where the persistence of damaged McSCs could ultimately result in a tumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the researchers emphasize that their research does not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, it does suggest seno-differentiation to be a protective pathway triggered by stress that does away with possibly detrimental cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“McSC fate tracking in mice revealed that McSCs undergo cellular senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation) in response to DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in their selective depletion and hair graying, and effectively protecting against melanoma,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So next time you or an older family member complains about their gray hair—remember that it might be a trait that naturally protects against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                A new study finds that cognitive training can increase the levels of a key chemical messenger in the brain responsible for decision-making, and reverse a process associated with aging.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists are &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557825/" target="_blank"&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt; by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The increase "is not huge," says &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/etienne-de-villers-sidani-md" target="_blank"&gt;Étienne de Villers-Sidani&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. "But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/michael-hasselmo-d-phil/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Hasselmo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The result backs earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10613518/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5477556/aging-brain-health-lifestyle-diet-exercise-social-alzheimers" target="_blank"&gt;improve thinking and memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Never skip brain day &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures," he says, "but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers used a &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/33S" target="_blank"&gt;special kind of PET scan&lt;/a&gt; to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think," Hasselmo says. "You go into a delirious state."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a "profound and notable effect" on memory and thinking in older people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hasselmo notes that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949236/" target="_blank"&gt;earliest Alzheimer's drugs&lt;/a&gt; reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For people with abnormally high blood sugar levels, losing weight is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;often proposed&lt;/a&gt; as the primary approach to preventing full-blown  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177747" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study challenges this approach by evaluating the efficiencies of other methods to bring levels back to safer levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the study found that the risk of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; could be cut by as much as 71 percent by following dietary and exercise guidelines, even if participants lost little to no weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaping-increases-your-risk-of-prediabetes-study-suggests"&gt;Vaping Increases Your Risk of Prediabetes, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings don't dismiss the importance of losing weight in reducing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-additive-combos-in-food-and-drinks-may-raise-risk-of-type-2-diabetes"&gt;diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt;, they could prompt a rethink on which outcomes to prioritize in strategies to treat prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Restoring a normal fasting blood sugar level is the most important goal in preventing type 2 diabetes and not necessarily the number on the scale," &lt;a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/meldung/744"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; diabetologist Andreas Birkenfeld, from the University of Tübingen in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 1,105 people with prediabetes, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0526"&gt;who were advised to follow&lt;/a&gt; a 12-month program to improve their diet and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-exercise-is-an-important-pillar-of-any-weight-management-regimen"&gt;exercise routines to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 234 members who hadn't lost weight by the end of the year, 51 still met the blood sugar criteria for prediabetes remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177750" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart.jpg" alt="Diabetes research chart" class="wp-image-177750 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177750" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Those who had reached prediabetes remission (R) were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those who hadn't (NR), even without weight loss.

Those in the group of 51 were some 71 percent less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes, compared to the other 183.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is similar to the 73-percent-reduction in risk seen in participants who had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-weight-loss-mechanism-could-one-day-trick-your-body-into-thinking-youve-exercised"&gt;lost weight&lt;/a&gt; and reached prediabetes remission after a year, compared to those who had lost weight but saw no remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further analysis on a subset of the volunteers revealed that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/whether-you-carry-fat-in-your-arms-or-legs-could-predict-risk-of-dementia"&gt;location of fat storage&lt;/a&gt; in the body is a significant factor. The group whose blood sugar levels returned to normal without weight loss had a lower percentage of visceral fat (around the organs) compared to those whose blood sugar levels stayed elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects what we know about the relationship between visceral fat and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2010.59"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exercise and a balanced diet have a positive effect on blood sugar levels, regardless of whether weight is reduced," &lt;a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/meldung/744"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Birkenfield. "Losing weight remains helpful, but our data suggests that it is not essential for protection against diabetes."&lt;br&gt;

While our bodies may reach their peak in early adulthood, evidence now suggests that the brain continues to develop and can perform at its highest level much later in life. Understanding when cognitive and emotional abilities peak offers a fresh perspective on aging, productivity, and leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Intelligence, led by Gilles E. Gignac, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Australia, examined a wide range of psychological traits that influence real-world performance. The research focused on core cognitive abilities—including reasoning, memory span, processing speed, knowledge, and emotional intelligence—as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124640846" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that several traits reach their highest levels later in life. Conscientiousness tends to peak around age 65, while emotional stability may not reach its maximum until approximately 75. Overall psychological functioning appears to crest between ages 55 and 60, before gradually declining from the mid-sixties and more sharply after age 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wisdom and Moral Reasoning Improve With Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond personality traits, the study also highlights cognitive skills often overlooked in discussions of aging. Moral reasoning and the ability to resist cognitive biases—mental shortcuts that can distort judgment—frequently continue to strengthen into the seventies and eighties. Gignac noted that these improvements may explain why demanding leadership positions in business, politics, and other fields are frequently held by individuals in their fifties and early sixties. While certain abilities like processing speed may decline with age, gains in judgment, perspective, and decision-making help balance these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124640846" id="div-vdoai-mid-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124640846" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Age Should Not Define Capability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these positive findings, older adults still face challenges in the workforce. Age discrimination persists, even though the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects workers aged 40 and above. According to a survey by résumé-building platform Resume Now, nearly 90% of employees over 40 reported experiencing workplace ageism, with roughly half indicating that employers favor younger candidates. Some professions, such as airline pilots and air traffic controllers, enforce mandatory retirement ages due to the high cognitive demands of these roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings challenge societal assumptions about aging. History shows that many notable achievements occurred in midlife or later. Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species at 50, Beethoven premiered his Ninth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/symphony-ltd/stocks/companyid-10473.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;Symphony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at 53 while profoundly deaf, and contemporary leaders like Lisa Su have delivered significant professional breakthroughs in their fifties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gignac emphasizes that cognitive ability varies widely among individuals, and evaluations should rely on actual performance rather than age assumptions. He encourages age-inclusive hiring and retention practices, reminding society that significant achievements often occur well past what is traditionally considered “peak age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend lifestyle measures to support long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/brain-health" target="_blank"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and fish, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and continuous learning can all help maintain cognitive functioning well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical performance typically peaks in early adulthood, usually between ages 25 and 35, researchers note that mental and emotional abilities follow a different timeline. Rather than declining with age, key psychological traits continue developing well into middle and late adulthood. Experts also emphasize that while genetics play a role in how the brain ages, lifestyle factors make a significant difference. Regular mental challenges—such as learning new languages, playing strategic games, or engaging in creative pursuits—can help sustain memory and reasoning skills. Combined with healthy habits, these activities may delay cognitive decline and enhance overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights how perceptions of aging often fail to match scientific evidence. Society tends to associate getting older with decline, yet data suggests that many individuals continue to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/excel-realty-n-infra-ltd/stocks/companyid-29124.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;excel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in complex thinking and emotional understanding well into their later years.

Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Fluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was "impossible" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, he said there had been a push for "generic, cheap medications" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said implementing the findings of this report would see "the 85% reduce dramatically" with "more people accessing better treatments".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The researchers are developing &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psymatik.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;a free online tool&lt;/a&gt; to help doctors and patients choose the right drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment.

But many people in their 60s, 70s and beyond may struggle for a variety of reasons to maintain the step count they used to reach. Until now it has been unclear how much people need to do as they age to reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research led by Harvard University has some answers. The large prospective study examined not only how many steps older people took but how often they reached step targets across the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers found achieving 4,000 steps per day on one or two days a week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death and lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared with not reaching this level on any day. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2025-110311" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study followed 13,547 American women over 62, with 72 the average age. They wore activity trackers for seven consecutive days between 2011 and 2015 and were followed for over a decade. None had heart disease or cancer at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the monitoring period to the end of 2024, 1,765 women died and 781 developed heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clocking up at least 4,000 steps a day on one or two days of the week was associated with a 26% lower risk of death from all causes and a 27% lower risk of dying from heart disease, compared with not reaching this threshold on any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those achieving this step count on at least three days of the week, the lower risk of death from any cause increased to 40%, but remained at 27% for the risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers said the important takeaway was that it is the amount people walk, rather than the number of days on which they achieve a certain number of steps, that is most important for reducing the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no “best” way to take your steps, they added. The key thing is just to get your steps in. They concluded that a “greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On average, the women took 5,615 steps a day. This was an observational study, and as such no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. There were also several limitations to the research, notably that physical activity was assessed for only one week, and only in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers wrote: “The present study … suggests that frequency of meeting daily step thresholds is not critical (even 1to 2 days a week of [more than] 4,000 steps a day was related to lower mortality and CVD), and that step volume is more important than the frequency of meeting daily step thresholds in the older population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They added: “An important translational implication of these findings is that since step volume is the important driver of the inverse associations, there is no ‘better’ or ‘best’ pattern to take steps; individuals can undertake [physical activity] in any preferred pattern (eg ‘slow and steady’ v ‘bunched patterns’) for lower mortality and CVD risk, at least among older women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They concluded: “These findings provide additional evidence for considering including step metrics in the next [physical activity] guidelines, and that ‘bunching’ steps is a viable option for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 22:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOOVFsNkMycFFsZGRmTW5CdUhhV0owa2V1VDRyWGJRSDZwa1cxN1h2WTlPTW0tR2VQQkZQWVd6SlhjOHJBVTdqaWNQLURHT2ZaY210XzR3czNTQkRjWTdUWk5rMDNKU0pMT053dG05aFlZaGNvcmNRX0xobk9yYnJXaXVzUVh6eXdwYlpjWmdfT1VBNTd1aVFMUURsWEJSeXlOVU13ZjdPVUwzSXd6bUE</guid></item><item><title>根据科学，每天感觉更好的秘诀- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/the-secret-to-feeling-better-every-day-according-to-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling better does not always require big changes. A week of five to ten minute practices improved emotional well-being and sleep while lowering perceived stress in 17,598 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program asked people to complete simple micro-acts, such as making a gratitude list, celebrating a friend’s success, or watching a short nature video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains grew with consistent participation, and the largest benefits often appeared among people facing financial strain or lower social status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-tiny-actions-matter"&gt;Why tiny actions matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elissa Epel, of the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;), co-authored the study and has examined how stress shapes health for years. Her team’s results fit with evidence that brief positive activities can shift emotions and thinking in reliable ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, found that positive psychology interventions can raise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-gut-brain-communication-affect-emotional-well-being/"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; and reduce depressive symptoms. Effects were small to moderate, which is typical for low burden approaches that are easy to keep doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/bigjoy?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Big Joy Project&lt;/a&gt; also tracked happiness agency, the sense that your emotions are within your control, and used a single group pre-post design, which is a before-and-after measurement approach without a comparison group, to evaluate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-seven-days-asked"&gt;What the seven days asked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day centered on gratitude, a practice with evidence from a classic randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12585811/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, showing that listing blessings can lift mood and life satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another day asked participants to do something kind for someone they already interact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An awe component used a short nature video followed by a few reflection prompts. The emotion of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25984788/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;awe&lt;/a&gt; is linked to a smaller sense of self and a greater willingness to help others, which can strengthen social connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other days focused on sharing a moment of celebration, ranking values, and noticing daily joy. Each activity took under ten minutes, including brief check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-benefited-most"&gt;Who benefited most&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits were not limited to people with many resources. The largest average gains appeared among participants reporting financial strain, lower education, lower subjective social status, or identifying as Black or Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger adults showed larger increases in emotional well-being and larger drops in perceived stress than older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;dose-response pattern&lt;/a&gt;, a trend where stronger participation leads to stronger results, pointed to consistency as a key ingredient, with full participation outperforming partial participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-small-moments-reshape-the-brain"&gt;How small moments reshape the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that emotional habits can change the neural pathways that govern mood and attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people focus on positive emotions, activity increases in the prefrontal cortex and decreases in the amygdala. These shifts may explain why simple joyful actions can help people feel calmer and more in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short bursts of joy may also influence the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-the-body-and-mind-during-extreme-sports/"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s built-in relaxation network that slows heart rate and supports recovery after stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeating small positive behaviors can strengthen these calming responses, much like short workouts strengthen muscles. The biological effects may be subtle each day but meaningful when practiced regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-not-claim"&gt;What this does not claim&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design did not include a control group, which means other explanations like expectation effects or outside life events cannot be ruled out. A randomized controlled trial will be important to test durability and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week of micro-acts is not a treatment for major depression, anxiety disorders, or trauma. It is a low cost practice that can help daily life feel more manageable while other supports are pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joy is a skill they can build,” said Epel. That perspective matches the finding that people reported greater control over their own happiness after the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-put-this-to-work"&gt;How to put this to work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick one micro-act that fits naturally into your day. Do it for one week at the same time to create a steady cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the action so easy that it takes five minutes. If you want more momentum, stack a second micro-act after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track whether your stress feels a notch lower, whether you fall asleep a bit faster, or whether your patience holds a little longer. If the practice helps, keep it and rotate a new one next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are under care for a mental health condition, check with your clinician before changing your routine. These practices can complement therapy and medication but do not replace them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-research-goes-next"&gt;Where research goes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work needs randomization, follow up, and tests of what parts carry the weight. Hints point to shifts in attention, values, and social connection as likely drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dose matters here, and so does access.

														&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a new class of CBD-like compounds that they say are even more effective at treating epilepsy and also promote brain cell development. But rather than extracting them from the cannabis plant, the scientists conducting the federally funded study used a common household kitchen spice: caraway seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) psychology students and faculty took the non-cannabis spice—which is commonly incorporated into breads, stews, cheeses and more–and genetically manipulated it to create compounds that closely resemble the molecular structure of non-intoxicating CBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a scientific feat on its own, the researchers are especially enthused about the results of pre-clinical trials using the caraway CBD that appear to show those compounds pack a “greater punch in stopping seizures” than natural cannabidiol found in the cannabis plant itself, with similarly low risk of adverse health events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These fully synthetic compounds, made from a safe plant extract and free of THC, not only prevented seizures and reduced seizure-related deaths but also promoted healthier brain cell development—without the sedative side effects of current treatments,” Dustin Hines, study co-author and professor of neuroscience at UNLV, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Childhood seizure disorders are often resistant to available drugs, and both the seizures and the current frontline therapies can severely affect brain development, cognition, and quality of life, making the discovery especially promising,” he &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/caraway-cure-engineering-cbd-seizure-treatments-without-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02220-1#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology late last month, found the synthesized CBD from the seeds of caraway, which is also known as meridian fennel, “significantly reduces seizure-related mortality in both C57Bl6 adults and a developmental epilepsy mouse model, supporting its potential for further preclinical and clinical development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported with National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, through the NIH component agencies the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors stressed that this is just the beginning of their research into the medical potential of these novel compounds, which they hope will lead to the development of new therapeutics for epilepsy. Currently, there’s one Food and Drug Administration- (FDA) approved CBD prescription drug, Epidiolex, that’s derived from cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advancing this new class of therapeutics holds significant promise for patients who have exhausted existing treatment options, whether due to debilitating side effects or a lack of response to currently available therapies,” Adriana Carrillo, a UNLV student who participated in the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging to help build the foundation for future treatment options that could one day offer families safer and more effective choices,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also offered a word of advice for the curious: Caraway seeds on their own do not contain CBD, so don’t expect to derive the benefits simply by loading up on the spice, because the seeds “just contain the scaffold to create it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy will begin publishing “public health alerts” in the coming month, CIDRAP Director Michael Osterholm &lt;a href="https://idweek2025.eventscribe.net/aaStatic.asp?SFP=WldXSkRZU0dAMjQyMjY#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced at the IDWeek conference&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alerts “will basically serve to be a way to convey the information that once was shared in the MMWR with all of us in a very timely way,” he said at the opening plenary of the conference of infectious disease specialists, according to a recording shared with STAT. “We encourage all of you to begin thinking about submissions of outbreaks or data you think should be evaluated. So, I hope you’ll help participate in that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for NEJM said the alerts would be published in a new section of its NEJM Evidence journal as needed — as opposed to being published on a weekly basis — and be made available for free. “In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more information on a new, rapid digital alert to disseminate essential data on disease outbreaks and other issues of public health importance,” created in partnership with CIDRAP, she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MMWR has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published weekly since 1952&lt;/a&gt; and has become part of the bedrock of public health; historically it’s been where details of new outbreaks and emerging diseases are first reported. But many public health practitioners’ trust in the publication has been shaken. In the earliest days of the Trump administration, new articles could not be published because of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administrations-cancels-scientific-meetings-abruptly/"&gt;communications pause&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first time in the journal’s history that it &lt;a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/lets-hope-the-mmwr-resumes-publication-sooner-rather-than-later/2025/01/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;missed publishing a new edition&lt;/a&gt;. Weekly editions have been paused again during the government shutdown, and earlier this month, much of the team behind the journal was laid off before &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;being reinstated hours later&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Kent, the journal’s former editor-in-chief, left the agency in February. She &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;previously told STAT&lt;/a&gt; that administration officials were pressuring the journal to change the way it reports information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told STAT the agency “is committed to the MMWR as the nation’s trusted, science-driven source for timely and accurate health information.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CIDRAP has begun taking on tasks that have generally been done by the federal government. In April, the center &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project-help-safeguard-us-vaccine-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;created the Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, which has put out parallel vaccine recommendations to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. Several professional societies, including the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, have adopted the Vaccine Integrity Project’s recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Osterholm said more is to come from CIDRAP as it aims to shore up public health infrastructure at a moment when political support is scarce. His center, he said, turned to private foundations to secure funding for eight graduate students. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We all understand it’s hard to do anything without resources. I am here tonight to actually report to you that there are a series of activities ongoing, and I’m involved with several of them, where more than 65 foundations are going to be pooling their resources to give out in a way to protect science,” he said at the conference. “This is a very critical time that the philanthropic world has to take a very different look at what they do and how they do it. It can’t be business as usual. … Tonight I am happy to report to you we will be following up with you in the near future not just with words but with dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story has been updated to say that the public health alerts will be published in a new section of NEJM Evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Vaccine Integrity Project aims to safeguard US vaccine use so that it remains grounded in the best science, free from external influence. CIDRAP is the publisher of CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were proud to work with IDSA to help provide the evidence necessary to write COVID vaccination guidelines that people who are immunocompromised can rely on to protect their health," Kevin Griffis, Vaccine Integrity Project spokesperson, told CIDRAP News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IDSA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians have all stepped up to fill the vital need for evidence-based immunization recommendations this fall and winter, prioritizing the health of their patients, especially those at greatest risk of severe disease," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDSA panelists reviewed evidence published in the 18 to 24 months since the evidence base for the last Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations were published (the search was started in June 2024). Most of the evidence was on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel included scientists who specialize in adult and pediatric infectious diseases, including the treatment of immunocompromised patients; vaccines and vaccine research; and transplant medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The panel established one clinical question for the use of each vaccine ('should [virus] vaccine vs no vaccine be used in immunocompromised patients?') and identified patient-importance outcomes for both vaccine effectiveness and adverse events (eg, hospitalization, mortality, progression to severe disease; and serious adverse events, or exacerbation of immunocompromising or autoimmune conditions, respectively)," the news release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With moderate-certainty evidence, the literature review found a link between COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised people and a reduction in related hospitalization. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates, which ranged from 33% to 56% in studies, included one cohort study (VE, 46%) and four test-negative case-control studies (VE, 37%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Less critical illness, death, healthcare use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination was tied to reductions in critical COVID-19 illness (VE, 40%) and death (VE, 61%), although the evidence was of low certainty, and COVID-related emergency department/urgent care visits (VE, 34%) and outpatient visits (VE, 40%), with moderate certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared clinical decision-making is essential, allowing flexibility in timing and dosing to accommodate immunosuppressive therapy schedules, travel, and individual risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most studies, follow-up time or time since last vaccine dose was relatively short, with a median of less than two months," the guideline authors wrote. "Given that vaccine protection decreases over time, these estimates are likely to represent higher-end values."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several adverse outcomes of interest, such as heart attack and stroke, were less common among vaccinated people. Although cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) were seen in the vaccinated group, the risk was lower than that in their unvaccinated counterparts, likely due to an increased risk of myocarditis due to COVID-19 infection itself. But the authors warn that this estimate was imprecise because cases were rare and because the evidence it was based on was of low certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All immunocompromised individuals aged ≥6 months should receive at least one dose of the current season’s COVID-19 vaccine, with additional doses based on prior vaccination history and clinical judgment," the guideline authors wrote. "Shared clinical decision-making is essential, allowing flexibility in timing and dosing to accommodate immunosuppressive therapy schedules, travel, and individual risk factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called for future research into, for example, correlates of protection and immunogenicity (ability to provoke an immune response) thresholds for diverse immunocompromised subgroups and vaccine-protection durability and waning in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolving immunosuppressive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Researchers say fewer children developed peanut allergies after guidelines were put into place calling for introducing peanut products to young children.

   &lt;p&gt;For years, parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts, to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. But 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;a landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;a new study published&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Early allergen introduction works," Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. "For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1500186" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence," Hill says, "and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;research was published&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack&lt;/a&gt; called Bamba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The revised recommendations, including in the&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more" in the past decade, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called &lt;a href="https://www.leapstudy.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt; (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's highly persistent," Hill says. "Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy."&lt;/p&gt;

The team sequenced semen samples from individuals between the ages of 24 and 75, using very high-precision technologies, and found that the male germ line (the line of cells that produce sperm) is subject to a combination of mutation and positive selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists used a duplex sequencing technique called NanoSeq, which can detect rare mutations with a very low margin of error. This allowed them to analyze 81 sperm samples from 57 donors. The results showed that a man's sperm adds an average of 1.67 new mutations every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But the most striking aspect of the study is not limited to the mere accumulation of mutations with age. The authors discovered that the male germ line is subject to positive selection. That is, certain mutations offer an advantage to cells that produce sperm and expand. They identified that many of these mutations are in genes related to developmental disorders or a predisposition to childhood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;"We expected to find evidence that selection influences mutations in sperm," said Matthew Neville, coauthor of the study published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09448-3"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature. "What surprised us was how much the number of sperm carrying mutations associated with serious diseases increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;What Does This Mean for Children of Older Fathers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers estimated that about 3 to 5 percent of sperm from middle-aged and older men carry some potentially pathogenic mutation in the exome (the coding part of the genome). That represents a higher risk than previous estimates. In more concrete numbers, the estimated fraction for men in their thirties was close to 2 percent, while it reached about 4.5 percent for men in their seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;From the evolutionary and clinical perspective, the implications are significant. Evolutionarily, it shows that the male germ line is not simply a "machine" that accumulates errors: There is a dynamic process of mutation and selection that can modify the genetic “quality” of the sperm with the age of the father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On the clinical side, however, it raises questions about reproductive planning, genetic counseling, and the additional risks associated with an older father. The authors argue that although the percentages remain modest, the the accumulation is not only linear but also has a selection component that favors mutations with the potential to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 18:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQNXhTdWxCQkk1ZDJzLTU2SkVMcFZuSzhyTk9veW15ZDRuRThGdHpSQzY0YnZNQ3ZsVjBaTVZ6elVHcVdLcEk4bW5XTHZaZ2ZERGsyTi12QTZ6V0FWZmtSRGN1Qy1WR29YUGNkN2lVXzZ2MlplTzZoMzd5WnhRUHl0Sm80TQ</guid></item><item><title>中风在55岁以下的人群中呈上升趋势。您知道要寻找什么吗？ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Stroke can happen to anyone, at any age and at any time. The number of strokes among younger adults under 55 is rising worldwide, and every day in the UK around 240 people experience the traumatic and life-changing effects of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/stroke-891"&gt;A stroke&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes described by doctors and stroke awareness campaigns as a "brain attack" to help people understand that a stroke is as urgent and life-threatening as a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-attack-2519"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Both happen when blood flow is suddenly cut off, depriving vital tissue of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of stroke. In an ischaemic stroke, blood flow to the brain is blocked, usually by a clot in a blood vessel. Without oxygen, brain cells begin to die, which can cause loss of movement, speech, memory or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;Huge Study Links 99% of Heart Attacks And Strokes With Four Risk Factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a haemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel inside the brain bursts. This is often due to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/high-blood-pressure-6076"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, which weakens blood vessel walls and makes them more likely to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating a stroke is a race against time because, as doctors say, "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4921513/"&gt;time is brain&lt;/a&gt;": the longer the brain is starved of blood and oxygen, the more brain cells die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments that can dissolve or remove a clot in an ischaemic stroke or lower dangerously high blood pressure in a haemorrhagic stroke must be given quickly to limit brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a suspected stroke should be taken by emergency services directly to a specialist stroke unit. Patients admitted to these dedicated units tend to have better outcomes because they receive expert care from doctors trained specifically to manage stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to recognise the signs of stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of early recognition of stroke symptoms &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ane.13618"&gt;is linked to&lt;/a&gt; higher mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acronym "Fast" (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) has been a cornerstone of public stroke awareness for more than 20 years. It was developed as a quick screening tool for use before hospital admission, helping people recognise the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/symptoms"&gt;signs of a stroke&lt;/a&gt; and seek urgent medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast highlights the most common warning signs of stroke, but some strokes present differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sure fewer cases are missed, additional symptoms such as dizziness, visual changes and loss of balance have been added, creating the Be Fast acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; = Balance problems. A sudden loss of balance or coordination, dizziness, or a sensation that the room is spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = Eyes. Sudden blurred vision, loss of vision in one or both eyes, double vision, or difficulty focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; = Face. Facial weakness or unevenness, often with a droop on one side of the mouth or eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = Arm or leg weakness or numbness, often affecting one side of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; = Speech difficulty, slurred speech, trouble finding words, or an inability to speak clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; = Time to call an ambulance. Make a note of when symptoms began, as this helps doctors decide which treatment is most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke symptoms often develop suddenly and can vary from person to person. Some people, particularly women, may experience stroke symptoms that are not included in the Be Fast acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are less likely to be recognised as having a stroke because their symptoms can differ from men's. These may include sudden fatigue, confusion, nausea, fainting, or general weakness rather than clear paralysis or slurred speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible signs for any person include a severe headache with no clear cause, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, agitation, or sudden memory loss. In some cases, a person may collapse, lose  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="178338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, or have a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stroke symptoms last only a few minutes or hours before disappearing completely within 24 hours. This may indicate a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transient-ischaemic-attack-tia/"&gt;Transient Ischaemic Attack&lt;/a&gt; (TIA), sometimes called a "mini stroke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TIA happens when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted, causing temporary symptoms. The difference between a TIA and a full stroke is that the blockage clears on its own before permanent brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a TIA is still a medical emergency and a serious warning sign that a major stroke could soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Advances in technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17474930241298450"&gt;Telemedicine has become an important tool&lt;/a&gt; in making rapid diagnosis and early treatment possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using secure video links, paramedics can consult with hospital stroke specialists in real time, even while still at the scene or en route to hospital. This allows early diagnosis, faster decision making and immediate preparation for treatment once the patient arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some ambulances now operate as mobile stroke units equipped with brain imaging scanners and clot-busting medicines. In London, &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/facetime-calls-between-doctors-and-paramedics-at-999-call-outs-improves-life-saving-stroke-care-12428277"&gt;video calls&lt;/a&gt; between senior doctors and paramedics at emergency scenes have helped speed up care and direct patients to the most appropriate treatment centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While telemedicine connects specialists to paramedics on the move, other tools are bringing medical help directly to patients within moments of a 999 call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.goodsamapp.org/"&gt;GoodSAM app&lt;/a&gt; was first developed to improve survival after cardiac arrest by alerting nearby trained responders to begin CPR before an ambulance arrives. The platform has since expanded to support other life-threatening emergencies, including stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-type-affects-your-risk-of-an-early-stroke-study-reveals"&gt;Your Blood Type Affects Your Risk of an Early Stroke, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone calls for help, the system identifies clinically trained staff or volunteers in the area and dispatches them to the scene while paramedics are on their way. These responders can provide rapid assessment, basic first aid and reassurance to the patient and family, and can help ensure that key information such as the time symptoms began is ready for the arriving medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining digital technology, trained volunteers and rapid communication, the app is helping bridge the critical gap between the onset of symptoms and hospital treatment: the period where, quite literally, every minute matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stroke can strike suddenly and without warning, but quick recognition and immediate medical attention can mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning the Be Fast signs and acting immediately could save a life, protect the brain and preserve a person's ability to speak, move and think.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266039/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="50 percent of both men and women" data-node-id="3.4" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;50 percent of both men and women&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication’s absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it’s derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sweetener" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; derived from the &lt;em data-node-id="7.3"&gt;Stevia&lt;/em&gt; plant.

Minoxidil, however, &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10461613/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10461613/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors&lt;/a&gt;, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;To test their new idea, researchers used &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a35876748/scientists-grow-mouse-embryo-outside-womb-are-humans-next/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a35876748/scientists-grow-mouse-embryo-outside-womb-are-humans-next/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mouse" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt; models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“While the mouse model results are promising, &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a66068104/immortality-xenotransplantation-human-longevity-research/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a66068104/immortality-xenotransplantation-human-longevity-research/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="human" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told &lt;em data-node-id="11.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-sweet-trick-could-make-hair-loss-treatments-rogaine-more-potent-2000668902" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://gizmodo.com/this-sweet-trick-could-make-hair-loss-treatments-rogaine-more-potent-2000668902" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gizmodo" data-node-id="11.3.0" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Unwanted hair loss isn’t a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65789451/longer-lasting-clothes-better-wash-cycle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65789451/longer-lasting-clothes-better-wash-cycle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="science" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.&lt;br data-node-id="12.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="13" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-15-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-a6tzot e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-15-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-79dz2t eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get Stronger With An Exclusive MH Program&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="inner-carousel" data-theme-key="carousel-inner-wrapper" class="css-cbaigl e1kgjrvy0"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="item" data-theme-key="carousel-item" class="css-m9cksi e1kgjrvy6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-33w51f e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-u94zfv e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div class="css-9xcc4r e1ghppmw15"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/recomp-landing-page-67733437617bd.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=640:*" alt="body recomp central" title="body recomp central" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-s7sxc4 e1ghppmw12"&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-mwacyu e1geg53v2"&gt;COURTESY DAVIDSON; ANDRE L.

The disease affects the macula, or the central part of the retina, and leads to vision loss in the center of the eye. In advanced AMD, a process known as geographic atrophy causes significant damage to retinal cells, which can cause full blindness in that eye. Geographic atrophy affects about &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 million people worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before receiving the implant, it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted," Sheila Irvine, a participant in the study who was diagnosed with AMD, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small clinical trial, 38 European patients with AMD had a small electronic chip implanted under the center of their retina below cells that had died. The chip wirelessly connects to a pair of augmented-reality glasses attached to a small computer that they each wear on their waistbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This setup, called the photovoltaic retina implant microarray or PRIMA system, uses a video camera in the glasses to capture images of text. The glasses then project that image as infrared light onto the implanted chip. Then, the chip converts the light into electrical signals, which the brain interprets as vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Xh5NVpxpMJCWqfLdnit7CN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Xh5NVpxpMJCWqfLdnit7CN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9c10684e-0db7-42a9-84b1-f63c6851ac04"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;In a small trial, an implanted chip placed just under the retina's cells is helping adults with age-related macular degeneration read again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Science Corporation)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="13caa200-6dc9-4ad5-86e3-243c1db6f5f1"&gt;"It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter," Irvine said in the statement.

A zoom function on the camera also helps users read fine-print text, such as that on a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ab8279ff-9d3e-483b-bc2b-bcd8ba585400"&gt;The PRIMA system does have some limitations,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doctors.masseyeandear.org/details/146" target="_blank" data-url="https://doctors.masseyeandear.org/details/146" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Demetrios Vavvas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear, who was not involved in the study, told&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tiny-eye-implant-special-glasses-legally-blind-patients-can-read-rcna238488" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tiny-eye-implant-special-glasses-legally-blind-patients-can-read-rcna238488" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;NBC News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In its current form, the device only restores vision in black and white, not color or grayscale, so it can't be used to recognize faces. In addition, it's not yet clear if the device will remain as effective after multiple years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, "as the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients," Vavvas told NBC.&lt;/p&gt;

But what is it about rolling your shoulders and flexing your upper back that brings stress relief? We finally have an explanation, thanks to new &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12441015/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Physiological Reports&lt;/em&gt;. The short answer is that this simple action may trigger the body’s parasympathetic nervous system, providing an almost immediate sense of calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this discovery and how you can use these findings to your advantage, we called up Jorge L. Reyes-Castro, MD, MS, a cardiac electrophysiology fellow in the Department of Medicine at University of Minnesota Medical School and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you stretch your upper back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, physicians at University of Minnesota Medical School and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine had 24 healthy adults perform a simple upper back and neck stretch. “We asked them to roll their &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-shoulder-exercises-1"&gt;shoulders&lt;/a&gt; back to more or less the level of their ears, while stretching their neck back,” Dr. Reyes-Castro says. Subjects were instructed to hold the stretch for at least 10 seconds, while continuing to breathe normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Reyes-Castro, this stretch resulted in a “substantial” drop in blood pressure—“a dramatic response for just rolling your shoulders,” he says. Crucially, the drop in blood pressure was not accompanied by a meaningful increase in heart rate. “Usually, what you expect in normal physiology is that when you have a drop in blood pressure, you will have a compensatory increase in your heart rate,” he says. “But in this case, the heart rate doesn't increase much, which could potentially contribute to the pleasant sensation that we feel when we stretch our shoulders, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-back-exercises"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;, and neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that this simple stretch triggers a reflex that activates the body’s parasympathetic nervous system. “The nervous system is controlled by two systems—the sympathetic and the parasympathetic,” Dr. Reyes-Castro explains. “When you’re doing anything that is intense, your sympathetic system is dominating. But when you are resting or calm, then your parasympathetic system is activated and the sympathetic system withdraws. So, what you are probably doing with this [stretch] is enhancing and activating the parasympathetic system, resulting in a state of pleasure, relaxation, and calmness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick stress relief whenever you need it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s participants were all seated for the duration of the experiment, Dr. Reyes-Castro says that you can reap the instant feel-good rewards of a quick upper-back stretch while standing or going about your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNdV8xSjdCbDRUaHUtMXFjWkZBZWt1WnFpd0ZnWGMtVVplZEVQbzVJODN0QUU2SVNfRV92WmFxcFZQT2NDWlExeE1Na19iaVRpMVJ4ZU5mZk9uOWxuN1h3ZGNRVjdjLUg4ZnlxN0VkWmVvWWVrVGlYM29LSU45VF8xaEtn</guid></item><item><title>Gulf Breeze老师在18轮化疗后敲响了钟声，标志着一个胜利的里程碑- WEAR-tv</title><link>https://weartv.com/news/local/gulf-breeze-teacher-rings-bell-after-18-chemo-rounds-marking-a-triumphant-milestone</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GULF BREEZE, Fla. -- October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and it's filled with stories of survival and hope. However, those stories often begin with fear and lives turned upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittany Kirk is in her element -- teaching at Oriole Beach Elementary, smiling and living with a confidence she never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four and a half years ago, her world shifted on its axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was taking a shower on May 5, and I was just washing in the shower," Kirk said. "I felt a bump that definitely was not there the day before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days, she had a double diagnosis -- triple positive invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no family history or genetic indication, she was suddenly facing a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, already in stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What in the world? I am 35 years old. I have a 3-year-old. I have a 6-year-old, and I was in a struggling marriage," Kirk said. "I had no idea how I was going to do this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day at a time, Brittany started fighting for her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a double mastectomy and 18 grueling rounds of chemo and additional medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother and her two boys gave her strength, and her care team gave her hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brittany talks about Dr. Alex Brown at Ascension Sacred Heart Cancer Center, she puts it bluntly: "The man saved my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For him, an essential part of cancer care is empathy for what the patient is going through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That drives you to learn; it drives you to understand everything you can about the disease that you're trying to treat," Dr. Brown said. "It will keep you motivated to be with that patient when things are tough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lobby of the cancer center, patients ring a bell when they finish their chemo treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittany made it to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I rang that bell all 18 times, one for every treatment," Kirk said. "It is the best feeling in the world to make it through that storm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting care immediately may have saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown says science and technology are increasing the chances for survival every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can tell folks, even if they have a stage of disease that isn't considered curable, that if we can just keep it under control, that new developments will happen," Dr. Brown said. "I can say that without any hesitation because it's true, and that's very inspiring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's another side; there's a light at the end of the tunnel," Kirk said.

Foods such as fish and seafood, meat, non-starchy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, eggs, and even full-fat dairy may play a key role in maintaining cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the Power of the Ketogenic Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the University of Missouri, researchers are exploring how these foods influence brain function. Their work focuses on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan known as the ketogenic diet. Early results suggest that this approach could not only support long-term brain health but also slow or even prevent cognitive decline, especially among individuals who face a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, Ai-Ling Lin, a professor in the School of Medicine, and doctoral student Kira Ivanich are examining how the ketogenic diet may benefit people with the APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their recent study using mice, Lin and Ivanich found that females with the APOE4 gene developed healthier gut bacteria and showed higher brain energy levels when following a ketogenic diet compared to those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Males did not show the same improvement, suggesting that gender may influence who benefits most from this dietary approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Brain Uses Fuel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key lies in how the brain produces its energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we eat carbs, our brains convert the glucose into fuel for our brains, but those with the APOE4 gene -- particularly females -- struggle to convert the glucose into brain energy, and this can lead to cognitive decline down the road," Ivanich said. "By switching to a keto diet, ketones are produced and used as an alternative fuel source. This may decrease the chance of developing Alzheimer's by preserving the health of brain cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the potential of "precision nutrition," an approach that adapts diets and interventions to fit a person's unique biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead of expecting one solution to work for everyone, it might be better to consider a variety of factors, including someone's genotype, gut microbiome, gender and age," Lin said. "Since the symptoms of Alzheimer's -- which tend to be irreversible once they start -- usually appear after age 65, the time to be thinking about preserving brain health is well before then, so hopefully our research can offer hope to many people through early interventions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing Research Through Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin joined Mizzou in part for its collaborative environment and advanced imaging facilities located in the NextGen Precision Health building and at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can do a lot of things in-house here that at other places we would have to outsource," Lin said. "This is team science. The impact we make will be much better when we work together than by ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cutting-edge imaging equipment and both research and clinical spaces under the same roof, the NextGen Precision Health building allows Mizzou to move quickly from preclinical models to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ivanich, that real-world impact is personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When my grandmother got Alzheimer's, that sparked my interest in this topic, so being able to make an impact to help people preserve their brain health is very rewarding," she said. "With Mizzou being a leading research university and having a tight-knit community feel, I know I'm at the right place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ketogenic diet modulates gut microbiota-brain metabolite axis in a sex-and genotype-specific manner in APOE4 mice" was published in the Journal of Neurochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Brain scans revealed increased levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down the brain’s “bliss molecule,” anandamide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance means less natural mood regulation and greater vulnerability to stress and relapse. The findings uncover a potential biological target for treating cannabis use disorder, especially in those who co-use tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Brain Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Co-use of cannabis and tobacco increased FAAH levels, reducing the “bliss molecule” anandamide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The imbalance may explain higher anxiety, depression, and relapse risk among co-users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying this mechanism could guide the development of targeted medications for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who use both cannabis and tobacco show distinct brain changes compared to those who use cannabis alone, according to a new study led by McGill University researchers at the Douglas Research Centre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding may help explain why people who use both cannabis and tobacco often report increased depression and anxiety, and why quitting cannabis is harder for them than for people only using cannabis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first evidence in humans of a molecular mechanism that may underlie why people who use both cannabis and tobacco experience worse outcomes,” said lead author Rachel Rabin, Associate Professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this mechanism is an important step toward finding targets for future medications to treat cannabis use disorder, especially among those that co-use tobacco. Right now, the only available treatments are behavioural therapies such as counselling,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Canada, about one in 20 people who used cannabis in the past year are considered at risk for cannabis use disorder. That figure rises to one in three among people who use it more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tobacco-smoking rates are declining overall, most people who use cannabis also use tobacco, the researchers note. Most studies have looked at cannabis and tobacco in isolation, Rabin added, leaving a gap that this preliminary study begins to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifts in brain’s ‘bliss molecule’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET brain scans revealed that people who used both tobacco and cannabis had higher levels of FAAH, relative to people who only used cannabis. FAAH is the enzyme that breaks down anandamide, a naturally occurring molecule sometimes called the “bliss molecule” for its role in mood and stress regulation. More FAAH means less anandamide, a pattern previously linked to anxiety, depression and relapse when trying to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed scans from 13 young adults. Eight smoked only cannabis, while five also smoked cigarettes daily. Cannabis users averaged just over one gram per day, while cigarette use ranged from one to 12 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the data was originally collected for another study, the research did not include a tobacco-only group. So it’s possible tobacco alone caused the changes. However, the researchers say the results suggest something more is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised us was how strong the effect was, and how different it was from those who only used cannabis, compared to those who used both tobacco and cannabis,” said co-author Romina Mizrahi, Professor of Psychiatry and director of the McGill Research Centre for Cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now recruiting people who smoke cigarettes and people who vape nicotine in a new study to test whether the same brain changes occur without cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study received funding form the National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059119906"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about the effects of smoking tobacco and cannabis together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: People who use both cannabis and tobacco show higher levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down anandamide, which is linked to mood regulation and addiction resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059162464"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The altered brain chemistry could explain why co-users often face greater mental health challenges and find it harder to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059180210"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What comes next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Scientists are now testing whether similar brain changes occur in people who smoke or vape nicotine without cannabis, to isolate the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dfd1ddd8d59ad0d1c4d5c4d1f4d9d7d3ddd8d89ad7d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2025.100369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;” by Rachel Rabin et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco is commonly co-used with cannabis. This is unfortunate because tobacco co-use exacerbates select clinical consequences associated with cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence demonstrates that low levels of anandamide, a prominent endocannabinoid, correlate with worse clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) degrades anandamide, and greater FAAH levels may underlie poorer clinical outcomes in people who co-use relative to those who use only cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we tested whether tobacco co-use increases FAAH levels beyond those associated with cannabis use alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis-using participants (N = 13) were parsed into individuals with daily tobacco use (CT, n = 5) and no current tobacco use (CAN, n = 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated group differences in FAAH, quantified using positron emission tomography and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CURB, while controlling for sex and FAAH genotype in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, sensorimotor striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. A significant group x ROI interaction for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CURB λk&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [F(5, 45)= 3.15, p = 0.016] emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests indicated greater FAAH levels in CT compared to CAN in the substantia nigra (p = 0.023, d=1.54) and cerebellum (p = 0.003, d=1.76), while a trend emerged in the sensorimotor striatum (p = 0.054, d=1.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings suggest that tobacco co-use is associated with elevated FAAH activity relative to cannabis-only use, which may underlie poorer clinical outcomes associated with co-use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:10:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1QNE1peVEwWkdhT1ZGU29GbkZoNVYwSUZ6blZ0NDQwSHRBQU1US2FSVUZjZ0xiNUJBd201MmFDdFFsN3Nqd3ozMTN1SVRQNndiV2R2WXVNZTcwdEMxRFdtRUxKVXlCNzJJVGRnQ1o3aTRLS05lSzJLUVZ3</guid></item><item><title>儿童肥胖的男性往往阴茎较短- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/men-who-were-obese-as-children-tend-to-have-shorter-penises/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in Vietnam investigating men who came to Hanoi Medical University Hospital for reproductive health checks found that those who were obese as children tended to have shorter penises as adults. Penis size was not associated with participants’ current body mass index, but there were some weak associations with waist and hip circumference. The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdaf184"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size and appearance of the human penis has long been a topic of interest both in medical research and in everyday discussions. For many men, penis size is associated with self-esteem and feelings of masculinity. Media, and particularly social media, often discuss the significance of penis size, promoting the idea that there is an “ideal size” and making penis size a source of anxiety for some men. However, although there are rare medical conditions (such as micropenis) that involve extreme deviations from the average penis size, most men who worry about the size of their penis fall within the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In scientific research, penis size is typically assessed using several measurements, including length and diameter (or circumference), in flaccid, stretched, and erect states. For instance, length is often measured along the top of the penis from the pubic bone to the tip of the glans, while girth is measured around the mid-shaft. Studies show that average erect penis length is about 13 to 14 centimeters (5 to 5.5 inches), with natural variation among individuals and populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Bac Hoai Nguyen and his colleagues note that penile development is a complex process influenced by genetics, hormones, and environmental factors. One such potential factor is obesity, particularly in childhood. Obesity is associated with declines in the male sex hormone testosterone during puberty, and testosterone is important for penile development. With this in mind, they conducted a study aiming to examine the association between prepubertal obesity and penis size in Vietnamese men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 290 heterosexual men who visited the Department of Andrology and Sexual Medicine of Hanoi Medical University Hospital for reproductive health check-ups between June 2023 and July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors measured participants’ height, waist and hip circumference, length of the second and fourth digits on both hands, and penis dimensions: pubic-to-tip flaccid length, skin-to-tip flaccid length, and pubic-to-tip stretched length. Study authors also measured the diameter of the glans and the mid-shaft in the flaccid state. They also had participants estimate their body mass index when they were 10 years old by adjusting the characteristics of 3-dimensional models. The age of 10 was selected because that is a time just before the start of puberty for most children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that 63% of participants had a normal body mass index when they were 10 years old. Of these, 26% became overweight, 31% became obese, and 4% became underweight as adults. Of the participants who were overweight as children, 30% had a normal body mass index as adults, while 46% became obese. Of the individuals who were obese as children, 27% became normal-weight, 24% became overweight, and none became underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants’ penises had a pubic-to-tip flaccid length of 8.9 cm, which increased to 14.4 cm when stretched. The average diameter of the penis was 2.93 cm at the glans and 2.83 cm at the middle. The study found that obese men had slightly wider mid-shaft diameters than overweight men, but not necessarily compared to normal-weight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who were obese as children tended to have shorter penises as adults. This was the case for stretched penis length and both measures of flaccid length. Higher waist circumference as an adult was associated with shorter skin-to-tip flaccid penis length. Higher hip circumference was associated with slightly longer pubic-to-tip stretched length. Penis dimensions were not associated with participants’ body mass index in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood obesity is associated with penile growth, while adulthood obesity relates to the appearance of the penis rather than the actual size. Thus, there is a need for early interventions to mitigate the potentially long-term effects of childhood obesity on penile development,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between obesity and penile development. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a group of men seeking medical help for reproductive issues and may not be representative of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdaf184"&gt;Associations between obesity across the lifespan and adult penis dimensions: a retrospective observational study of Vietnamese men using 3D-modeled prepubertal BMI,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Bac Hoai Nguyen, Quan Minh Pham, Anh Bui Quoc Nguyen, Anh Phuong Nguyen, Vu Bui Duy Nguyen, Andrea Sansone, and Emmanuele A.

&lt;p&gt;And Dengue in California:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is investigating the year's first case of locally acquired &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5159" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;dengue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in a San Gabriel Valley resident. The patient, who became ill in late September and is recovering, reported no travel to areas endemic for the mosquito-borne infection. Last year was the first year LA reported local dengue, with 14 cases. The risk of widespread dengue virus transmission in Los Angeles County is low, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more H9N2 &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/two-new-h9n2-avian-flu-cases-reported-china" target="_blank"&gt;human cases in China&lt;/a&gt;. That makes 21 in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of new reports of avian flu &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/us-documents-dozens-new-avian-flu-cases-wild-birds-paho-notes-human-case" target="_blank"&gt;In wild birds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Cambodia again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cambodia yesterday announced its 16th H5N1 avian flu case of the year, the first since &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodia-announces-15th-human-h5n1-infection-year" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;early August&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, according to a Cambodia Ministry of Health press release translated and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/10/cambodian-moh-announces-16th-h5n1-case.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;posted today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. The patient is a 3-year-old girl from Kampong Speu province who is in intensive care. Chickens and ducks in the patient's home and in neighboring houses had been sick and dying for roughly a week when the child became ill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The latest human cases in the country have involved a reassortant (2.3.2.1e) between an older H5N1 clade that has circulated in Cambodia since 2014 and the newer clade 2.3.4.4b virus that is circulating globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first locally acquired case of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/first-locally-acquired-us-case-more-severe-clade-1-mpox-identified-california" target="_blank"&gt;Clade 1 mpox&lt;/a&gt; was reported in Long Beach, California. Previous cases had all been travel-related.  And now &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/3rd-case-locally-acquired-clade-1-mpox-california-officials-warn-community-spread" target="_blank"&gt;There are 3.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the good news is that &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/last-ebola-patient-dr-congo-discharged-countdown-end-outbreak-starts" target="_blank"&gt;The last case in the DRC outbreak of Ebola&lt;/a&gt; is being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of good news about vaccines.  &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/study-finds-no-link-between-mrna-covid-vaccines-early-pregnancy-and-birth-defects" target="_blank"&gt;No link between Covid vaccine in pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and any of the 75 birth defects they studied.  The Southern Hemispere flu vaccine was about &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/protection-flu-vaccine-around-50-southern-hemisphere-data-reveal" target="_blank"&gt;50% effective&lt;/a&gt;, and this year's Northern Hemisphere formula will be the same, so probably equally effective.  Never super good, not with a slippery virus like flu.  But always helpful.  Covid mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-mrna-vaccines-may-be-able-train-immune-system-attack-cancer-cells-boost-survival" target="_blank"&gt;Appear to help the immune system fight cancers&lt;/a&gt;.  And shingles vaccine, more than other vaccines it was compared to, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/shingles-vaccine-tied-significant-reductions-risk-dementia-heart-disease-and" target="_blank"&gt;Significantly reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia, heart disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

Such events happen every day as medicine progresses, but this one stands out because “enteral ventilation” is more popularly known as “butt-breathing” or a few other names you can probably fill in for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dna-discovery-signals-a-bum-breathing-turtles-survival-63657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Australian turtle species&lt;/a&gt; have found a way to delay the dangers of coming to the surface to breathe by extracting oxygen dissolved in water using their &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-its-so-damn-hard-to-tell-the-sex-of-a-dinosaur-79503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cloaca&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, they have gill-like features in their bums that supplement their oxygen intake. &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dragonfly-babies-breathe-through-their-butts-but-thats-not-all-76934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-pasted="true"&gt;Dragonfly nymphs do something similar&lt;/a&gt;, and even expel the water afterwards as a form of jet propulsion. This, however, is Australia, and you can probably find seventeen weirder animal behaviors within a stone’s throw of a butt-breathing turtle (arguably including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-endangered-turtle-breathes-out-of-its-butt-and-is-one-of-the-most-evolutionarily-distinct-reptiles-on-the-planet-47107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their headwear&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical applications were probably not the first thing on the mind of those who discovered the trait. However, sick of watching patients struggle for breath with various lung conditions, and inspired by loaches (fish that process air through their stomachs), Dr Takanori Takebe of the Institute of Science, Tokyo, proposed to take an algal leaf out of the turtles’ book. Inevitably, the work was awarded the 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dead-trout-swimming-and-pigeon-missiles-2024-ig-nobel-prizes-are-outrageous-as-ever-75943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ig Nobel physiology prize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pigs-and-rodents-can-breathe-through-their-rectums-so-we-probably-can-too-59716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;demonstrating the viability&lt;/a&gt; of mammals being able to breathe through their butts on some no doubt surprised pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the challenges of getting taken seriously, Takebe has ploughed ahead, and the first results are promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takebe stressed in a &lt;a href="https://scienceblog.cincinnatichildrens.org/ignobel-butt-breathing-idea-from-2024-moves-closer-to-real-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reptiles’ metabolisms are so much slower than those of mammals that they need far less oxygen, so it is perhaps unsurprising that they can get useful amounts this way. Even then, no known turtle species can rely entirely on this approach for their oxygen needs, the highest being about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Takebe and colleagues knew they couldn’t just blow some air up a patient’s ass to keep their blood oxygenated. Their approach is to create a liquid rich in dissolved oxygen, much like deep-sea divers used in the science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, but provide it anally for absorption through the colon. After all, if nutrients can make their way from the intestine straight to the blood, why not oxygen? The liquid, perfluorodecalin, can hold 40-50 times as much oxygen by volume as can be dissolved in water, and about twice as much as human blood holds, but releases it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the idea actually requires less advanced technology than mechanical ventilators when lungs are failing, and so might be available in remote regions or where finances are more limited. Moreover, ventilators can cause lung injuries, with long-term consequences for the short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, 27 healthy Japanese men were administered perfluorodecalin liquid rectally and asked to hold it for 60 minutes. Quantities were increased through the trial, in some cases reaching a liter and a half of the liquid. Twenty of the 27 reached the 60-minute goal, and while those on the larger amounts reported some discomfort and abdominal bloating, there were no serious side effects, nor detectable absorption of the liquid. Discomfort appeared to have been associated with not having defecated during the previous 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="87126" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;People have yet to breathe through their butts, but the study showed the carrier liquid is safe, making a first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Med&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, this was just a safety test, and the perfluorodecalin was not carrying oxygen. Trials using an oxygenated version of the liquid will be next, still on healthy volunteers. If these are similarly successful, the team will move on to those struggling to breathe. They hope the work will be particularly useful for newborns whose lungs are not yet operating properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2313680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1.5 million critically ill adults&lt;/a&gt; undergoing tracheal intubation each year in the USA alone, 10-20 percent of whom suffer damagingly low oxygen levels, there is the potential for widespread demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the way influencers try to turn everything into a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fibermaxxing-valid-health-hack-or-a-fast-pass-to-flatulence-80291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wellness trend&lt;/a&gt;, we do have some concerns, however, and would rather not be around when yoga instructors encourage participants to “breathe out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are expensive, and gaining funding is always a struggle, but that challenge has increased exponentially this year. Takebe is taking advantage of the publicity the work attracts to seek funds, and said that the better that goes, the faster research can progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Med&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:43:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQUlRybnFNa1VFdElJQWVxeDduTVB4QnVpQXV5VEZjSTVBSlBYbGJnOElBcXVKRjQ1OEVzSnZpUHVIUEVUUHh0WHRoWnVlbFZXcmM3TFBmS3lvalpiLTFKTEI1UVBmQzAxRE4wX181ZF96Z1NPaHFBWkxsR1J2dGZkNi1FWFY3czdPQ1RJaXZDYm80ajRiMHZxeDVYLXdjekJTVExvRXhycEhORENXbVF1RDhn</guid></item></channel></rss>
