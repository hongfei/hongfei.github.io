Earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the influential vaccine panel, replacing them with his own picks, many of whom have spoken out against Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c18cb" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist who has falsely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;called the Covid vaccine the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” first &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-wants-limit-cdcs-role-infectious-diseases-rcna228543" target="_blank"&gt;moved to limit access to shots&lt;/a&gt; in May, when he bypassed the typical regulatory process and announced the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391b91" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s sign-off on Monday does not mean people younger than 65 are barred from getting a Covid vaccine — they still can do so, after consulting with a doctor or pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b293" class="body-graf"&gt;Adding in this so-called shared clinical decision-making essentially “puts up one more little barrier” to getting the shot, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University. “It’s kind of a vague term that says you should have your doctor or your provider or pharmacist tell you what the risks and benefits are before you get the vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838119" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC said that the vaccine panel's recommendations for people under 65 found the most benefit for someone at  increased risk for severe Covid due to underlying conditions. The benefit of vaccination was lowest for people under 65 who aren't at increased risk for severe Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b397c5" class="body-graf"&gt;But how easy it is to get a Covid shot may depend on where you live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b07538" class="body-graf"&gt;In previous years, states have generally mirrored the CDC’s vaccine guidance, particularly that of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-eligibility-limit-over-65-health-conditions-cdc-rcna232374" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, which had been considered one of the foremost authorities on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-737bdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to the CDC’s announcement, 26 states (mostly blue states with Democratic governors) had already set their own Covid shot guidance to keep access as broad as possible, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca1e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;The result is a complex hodgepodge of Covid vaccine policies nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d6a91" class="body-graf"&gt;“We now have had a breakdown in consensus between the federal government and the states as to how to manage Covid immunization,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We are facing an unprecedentedly complicated landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467879" class="body-graf"&gt;Illinois, Maryland and Washington, D.C., for example, officially recommend universal Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Other states, like California, Michigan and Minnesota, recommend the shots for everyone 3 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f973e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Viruses don’t respect state borders,” Levy said. “From the perspective of protecting the public against infectious diseases, the last thing you would want as a strategy is to protect different states differently. It’s confusing, it’s inconsistent, and it leaves certain people vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ea36" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, some doctors’ offices might not have any incentive to stock the vaccine since the CDC’s recommendation focuses on older adults. Last season, 23% of adults and 13% of children got the Covid vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-888eb6" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s all kinds of ways where people who want the vaccine might not be able to get it because of all of these little obstacles that are put in place, even though, in theory, anybody 6 months and older should be able to get them,” said Maldonado, who is also a pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2d6ac" class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS Health, said its pharmacies would be ready to administer Covid shots for people ages 5 and older as soon as the CDC signed off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens starts Covid vaccines at age 3. A spokesperson for Walgreens said in an email that the pharmacy chain “will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide” without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-fed0a5" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a Covid shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b3e482" class="body-graf"&gt;While a summer uptick in cases appears to have peaked in most areas of the country, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, every year since the Covid pandemic started in 2020 has also had a winter wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3264b" class="body-graf"&gt;Like the flu shot, the Covid vaccine doesn't necessarily stop a person from getting infected with the virus. But it does reduce the chances of severe illness, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b3e3d" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer and Moderna’s updated Covid shots target the LP.8.1 variant, which was the dominant strain in the U.S. earlier this year but has been&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt; overtaken by newer variants&lt;/a&gt;. Novavax’s updated Covid shot targets an even older strain, called JN.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1838f1" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Sept. 27, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt;LP.8.1 accounts for just 3%&lt;/a&gt; of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. A strain called XFG is now dominant, accounting for at least 85% of new Covid cases. All are descendants of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/omicron-symptoms-covid-what-to-know-rcna9469" target="_blank"&gt;omicron variant&lt;/a&gt;, which emerged in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-faf171" class="body-graf"&gt;Research presented by Moderna and Pfizer at an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186595/download" target="_blank"&gt;FDA advisory committee meeting in May&lt;/a&gt; found that the updated shot generated a modestly stronger immune response to the strains circulating at that time than last year’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3a43d" class="body-graf"&gt;It typically takes a few weeks after the Covid vaccine for immunity to build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99f37a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Covid shot free?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a548f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people with insurance who want a Covid vaccine should be able to get it free this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-347ae6" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead of the CDC’s advisory committee meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;AHIP&lt;/a&gt;, a health insurance industry trade group, said that private plans will continue to cover all CDC-recommended vaccines that were recommended as of Sept. 1, meaning its previous Covid shot recommendation for everyone 6 months and older still applies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-449a61" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs will continue to cover the shots at no cost, according to an HHS spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 14:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQWGRkbGZvRXY5WlFXTFo2OW81eDZmQWhIVVFtU3ZoUHdHMTFiTFNoNmhDTlJPNzZzTkpZZGNoOGY3WkpyQU44Y29DRk94WmxwX2wzTC1RaWJaMDZVVy04ZkJCZzlnOFpib3V5SWZSVndMd3BBaktGTkEtNElyanFadnpHd2dhUDl3cXpRUG53M1BEamhkREFCeGplV0ZKTl9LUG53SjhveEF3aV9aOXh2cmt0bGd3YVXSAVZBVV95cUxOcUhlQ2dYZmhRSUxqX1BZNGxta3NBYWNURGFiYVBBcnhlZWh1dkhtWUFJb0Z1ZVFubVE0V0loM0ozYjByZWY4dFowdUNRU0pxNzdDR05NQQ</guid></item><item><title>脂肪肝引起的心脏病：了解代谢功能障碍与心血管之间的联系-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-diseases-caused-by-fatty-liver-understanding-the-link-between-metabolic-dysfunction-and-cardiovascular-health/articleshow/124310237.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease, including Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), is increasingly recognised as a major global health concern. While it primarily affects the liver, research shows it also has significant effects on overall health, particularly the heart. Individuals with fatty liver are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular problems such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Factors like chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and altered lipid metabolism link liver fat accumulation to heart health. Fatty liver disease can progress silently over years, often without obvious symptoms, but may lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased mortality if left unmanaged. Early detection, lifestyle changes, and medical management are essential to reduce risks and protect both liver and cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding fatty liver disease and its link with heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in liver cells. In MASLD, this condition arises in individuals without significant alcohol consumption, often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The disease progresses through stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Ways to check for fatty liver at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple steatosis: Fat accumulation without inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH): Fat accumulation accompanied by inflammation and liver cell damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cirrhosis: Severe scarring of the liver tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver cancer: Development of malignant cells in the liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages often present no symptoms, making early detection challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heart conditions caused by fatty liver disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research indicates a robust association between fatty liver disease and various cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease contributes to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to narrowed and hardened arteries. This occurs because excess fat in the liver can increase systemic inflammation and promote the accumulation of cholesterol-rich deposits in blood vessels. Over time, these plaques reduce blood flow, increase blood pressure, and significantly raise the risk of stroke and heart attack. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000153" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; discusses how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is the principal cause of death in patients with NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of fatty liver disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Coronary artery disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with fatty liver are at a higher risk of developing blockages in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. The combination of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation associated with fatty liver accelerates the progression of CAD. This can manifest as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or, in severe cases, a heart attack. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Lancet Regional Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; – Europe highlights that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of fatty liver disease, can lead to liver scarring (fibrosis), cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and liver cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease may elevate the risk of heart failure, a condition where the heart cannot pump blood effectively to meet the body’s needs. Chronic metabolic stress from fatty liver can lead to structural and functional changes in the heart, including thickening of the heart walls (left ventricular hypertrophy) and reduced cardiac efficiency. People with fatty liver are also more likely to develop high blood pressure, further contributing to heart failure risk. Additionally, inflammation and insulin resistance associated with fatty liver can strain the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Arrhythmias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8238775/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Reviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the risk of cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications. The presence of fatty liver is linked to an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation. Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and electrolyte imbalances associated with fatty liver can disrupt the electrical signaling of the heart. Arrhythmias can increase the risk of stroke, reduce cardiac efficiency, and, in severe cases, lead to sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in individuals with fatty liver disease, surpassing liver-related complications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mechanisms linking fatty liver to heart disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms explain the connection between fatty liver disease and cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic inflammation in the liver can lead to systemic inflammation, affecting blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/strong&gt;: Fatty liver is often associated with insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dyslipidemia:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered lipid metabolism in fatty liver disease leads to increased levels of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides, contributing to plaque formation in arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidative stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess fat in the liver can produce reactive oxygen species, damaging blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors collectively increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in individuals with fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importance of early detection and management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the asymptomatic nature of early-stage fatty liver disease, regular screening is crucial, especially for individuals with risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One dose, weeks of relief:&lt;/strong&gt; A single psilocybin injection reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice within 24 hours, with effects lasting at least 12 days.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain circuits, not injuries:&lt;/strong&gt; The pain relief came from calming overactive neurons in a mood-and-pain processing region of the brain, not from healing the actual injuries, which remained visible at the study’s end.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin worked when it reached the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex but had no effect when injected near the spinal cord, showing pain relief happens in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle balance beats brute force:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin’s partial activation of two serotonin receptors simultaneously proved more effective than fully activating either one alone or blocking pain signals entirely.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain and depression are intertwined:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice with worse pain consistently showed worse anxiety and depression, and psilocybin relieved both simultaneously by rebalancing the same brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA —&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that a single treatment with psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, rapidly reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice. The relief lasted for at least 12 days, the duration of observation after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02068-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, confirms what doctors have long observed but struggled to treat: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just hurt the body. It rewires the brain, creating psychological suffering that worsens the original pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-pain-breaks-the-brain-s-thermostat"&gt;Chronic Pain Breaks the Brain’s Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team created two types of lasting pain in mice during the four-week study. Some had nerve damage. Others had severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;  in their paws. Both groups became hypersensitive to touch and developed what looked like mouse versions of profound &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. They avoided open spaces, gave up faster in swimming tests, and showed impaired movement coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging revealed the culprit. A region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which processes both the emotional experience of pain and regulates mood, had essentially broken. Think of it like a smoke detector that won’t stop blaring even after the fire’s out. Nerve cells in this area were firing 40% more than they should have been, and they wouldn’t calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hitting-the-reset-switch"&gt;Hitting the Reset Switch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On day 27, researchers gave mice a single &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;injection of psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;. Within 24 hours, sensitivity to pain dropped to normal levels in both groups. The mice also returned to typical behavior in tests measuring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The improvements lasted. Even 12 days after the single treatment (when the experiment ended), &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pain-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; continued and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The location of psilocybin’s action mattered enormously. When researchers injected &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-magic-mushrooms-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocin&lt;/a&gt; (what psilocybin becomes in the body) directly into the anterior cingulate cortex, they saw dramatic improvements. When they injected it into the spinal cord near the injury site, nothing changed. The activity levels that had been 40% above normal dropped back to baseline within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-it-worked"&gt;Why It Worked&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin affects two types of serotonin receptors in the brain: 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A. The researchers found it needs both to work its magic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers blocked either one before giving psilocybin, all benefits vanished. Pain returned, anxiety stayed high, depression-like behaviors persisted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But overstimulating those same receptors individually didn’t help either. Maxing out 5-HT2A receptors alone actually increased activity in already overactive circuits. Maxing out 5-HT1A receptors alone decreased activity but provided only modest pain relief and no mood benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only psilocybin’s partial activation of both receptors simultaneously restored normal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than blocking pain signals or dampening all brain activity, psilocybin &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-rewire-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recalibrates specific circuits&lt;/a&gt; that chronic pain has knocked out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pain-and-depression-a-two-way-street"&gt;Pain and Depression: A Two-Way Street&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study mapped how chronic pain and depression reinforce each other. Mice with either type of chronic pain showed nearly identical patterns: worse pain correlated with more depression and anxiety, measured across multiple behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined individual animals, pain severity predicted &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-treat-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological distress&lt;/a&gt; consistently. Both male and female mice showed the same relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, mice could choose between two rooms: one where they’d received psilocybin before, and one where they’d gotten saltwater. They spent significantly more time in the psilocybin room. The researchers say this shows the mice associated that space with feeling better, not that they were seeking the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pain relief didn’t come from healing the injury itself. When researchers examined nerve injury sites 40 days later, nerve tangles were still present. The pain reversal came entirely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushroom-brain-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-people"&gt;What This Means for People&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, while the study used mouse models, keep in mind that human chronic pain involves additional psychological and social complexity. The specific dose, delivery method, and treatment schedule would need extensive testing for human use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the 50 million &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/1-in-3-americans-constant-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Americans living with&lt;/a&gt; chronic pain, along with the large portion who also battle depression and anxiety, the research offers new understanding of how these conditions intertwine in the brain. If similar effects occur in humans, periodic treatment might someday become possible, but that remains unproven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early human trials with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; for chronic pain are already underway, though these remain exploratory. Whether the dramatic effects seen in mice will translate to human patients is uncertain, but the neurobiological insights alone advance understanding of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; transforms the brain and why it resists treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers induced chronic pain in adult mice using two established models: spared nerve injury (surgical cutting of two of three sciatic nerve branches) and complete Freund’s adjuvant injection (large-volume inflammatory compound into the footpad). They measured mechanical sensitivity using electronic von Frey testing, which records the precise pressure at which mice withdraw their paws. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors were assessed through elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, and light/dark box testing. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake, head-fixed mice expressing GCaMP6f allowed real-time visualization of neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. For drug experiments, researchers used systemic injections of psilocybin (0.5 mg/kg) as well as local applications of psilocin, serotonin receptor agonists, and antagonists. Sample sizes ranged from 5-30 mice per group depending on the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both pain models produced mechanical hypersensitivity lasting over 27 days, with withdrawal thresholds dropping to less than 50% of normal. Increased depression and anxiety-like behaviors coincided with the pain. A single dose of psilocybin on day 27 reversed mechanical allodynia within 24 hours, returning sensitivity to pre-injury levels, with effects persisting through day 40. Mood-related behaviors similarly normalized. Two-photon imaging revealed that chronic pain increased spontaneous neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by approximately 40%, and local psilocin application reduced the hyperactivity back to baseline within minutes. Bilateral psilocin injection to the anterior cingulate cortex replicated systemic psilocybin’s effects on both pain and mood, while spinal injection had no effect. Blocking either 5-HT2A or 5-HT1A receptors before psilocybin completely prevented therapeutic effects. Full agonism at these receptors individually or combined produced only partial benefits compared to psilocybin’s partial agonist activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted exclusively in rodent models, which may not fully capture the complex nature of human chronic pain. All pain models were induced acutely rather than developing naturally. The relatively short follow-up period (40 days) doesn’t address whether benefits would persist long-term or whether repeated dosing might be necessary. Sex-based analysis was preliminary, with some behavioral tests showing small sample sizes for detecting potential sex differences. The mechanism by which psilocybin induces lasting changes beyond its immediate effects remains unclear. The study didn’t examine potential adverse effects or safety concerns beyond basic behavioral observation. Local drug administration experiments required surgical procedures that might themselves influence pain processing.&lt;/p&gt;

                Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. "She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with," recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message simply said: "Pray for her."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost "lifeless." Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon it became clear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133987/marburg-virus-rwanda-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;country's first Marburg outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a year later, the basics of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415816" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/01/g-s1-30948/virus-marburg-outbreak-rwanda-unprecedented-success" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;international renown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a model for a successful outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 out of every 10 patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"This is real"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. "I was overcome with emotion — crying," says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A colleague saw her. "He consoled me. He hugged me," Firew recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's "ouchie." Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: "I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no approved treatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just extremely scary," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. "He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. "They would go isolate. They'd test positive," she says. "And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mommy, I need you"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Of course, I freak out," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: " 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was on the verge of dying," she recalls. "The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices" — their gums, their nose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Hearing voices"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, "I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. "I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues," she says. "Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91491" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"No Marburg deniers"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers," she recalls thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures," she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity," Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The discussions about public health can be so discouraging," she says. "But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91499" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. "In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'" says Firew.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"My three-year-old, he ran across the airport when he saw me and it was like this prolonged hug — he just did not want to let go of me," she recalls through tears. "It was a feeling that I've never had before."&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that people diagnosed in early childhood often have a different genetic profile than those diagnosed later in life, broadening the understanding of how the condition develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09542-6"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analyzed the behavior of autistic people during childhood and adolescence in the United Kingdom and Australia. It also evaluated genetic data of more than 45,000 patients with the condition from diverse cohorts in Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;By linking genetic information to age at diagnosis, the researchers observed that the profiles of those identified early with the condition differed from those who received confirmation at later stages. They found only a slight overlap between the two groups, indicating that the biological mechanisms associated with autism in childhood may be different from those linked to autism identified in adolescence or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The analysis, published last week in the journal Nature, showed that children diagnosed before the age of 6 were more likely to have behavioral difficulties—such as problems with social interaction—from an early age. In contrast, those diagnosed after the age of 10 were more likely to experience social and behavioral difficulties during adolescence. They also had a greater predisposition to mental health conditions, such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study adds that the average genetic profile of those diagnosed later was closer to that of &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/los-diagnosticos-de-tdah-estan-aumentando-en-ninos-y-adolescentes-revela-un-nuevo-informe"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder than to that of “classic” autism identified in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study concludes that the timing of diagnosis is not entirely random but reflects underlying genetic differences that, in some cases, coincide with risk for other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles,” said Varun Warrier, a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the paper, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism"}' href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOYXJLZFN6Wm1USzhpNFUtbkY3aS1oZVBhdVpwR0cxX0lVMTlLSDNzckFtelN0dTU4Yk9BNW14Y0FMYWFGaGZwTkZERkd5ZG9wV3JYdkROM0hMWEVkYzE2UmR6Z3A4em1acVREdEhNa0ZBTEM0anpFaVZZY0VzTTZHRzNVSmh1Z2lna0xydkkzbXZFM25RM0ZXQmpDRkZUclJqVExuaFdtQTY</guid></item><item><title>理解大脑的神经科学家Dale Purves - Aeon</title><link>https://aeon.co/essays/dale-purves-the-neuroscientist-who-makes-sense-of-the-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="has-dropcap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture someone washing their hands. The water running down the drain is a deep red. How you interpret this scene depends on its setting, and your history. If the person is in a gas station bathroom, and you just saw the latest true-crime series, these are the ablutions of a serial killer. If the person is at a kitchen sink, then perhaps they cut themselves while preparing a meal. If the person is in an art studio, you might find resonance with the struggle to get paint off your hands. If you are naive to crime story tropes, cooking or painting, you would have a different interpretation. If you are present, watching someone wash deep red off their hands into a sink, your response depends on even more variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we act in the world is also specific to our species; we all live in an ‘umwelt’, or self-centred world, in the words of the philosopher-biologist Jakob von Uexküll (1864-1944). It’s not as simple as just taking in all the sensory information and then making a decision. First, our particular eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin already filter what we can see, hear, smell, taste and feel. We don’t take in everything. We don’t see ultraviolet light &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-urbanisation-can-be-a-friend-to-the-biodiversity-of-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like a bird&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t hear infrasound &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-we-should-tune-into-the-orchestra-of-the-animal-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like elephants&lt;/a&gt; and baleen whales do. Second, the size and shape of our bodies determine what possible actions we can take. Parkour athletes – those who run, vault, climb and jump in complex urban environments – are remarkable in their skills and daring, but sustain injuries that a cat doing the exact same thing would not. Every animal comes with a unique bag of tricks to exploit their environment; these tricks are also limitations under different conditions. Third, the world, our environment, changes. Seasons change, what animals can eat therefore also changes. If it’s the rainy season, grass will be abundant. The amount of grass determines who is around to eat it and therefore who is around to eat the grass-eaters. Ultimately, the challenge for each of us animals is how to act in this unstable world that we do not fully apprehend with our senses and our body’s limited degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fourth constraint, one that isn’t typically recognised. Most of the time, our intuition tells us that what we are seeing (or hearing or feeling) is an accurate representation of what is out there, and that anyone else would see (or hear or feel) it the same way. But we all know that’s not true and yet are continually surprised by it. It is even more fundamental than that: you know that seemingly basic sensory information that we are able to take in with our eyes and ears? It’s inaccurate. How we perceive elementary colours, ‘red’ for example, always depends on the amount of light, surrounding colours and other factors. In low lighting, the deep red washing down the sink might appear black. A yellow sink will make it look more orange; a blue sink may make it look violet. If, instead of through human eyeballs, we measured the wavelengths of light coming off the scene with a device called a spectrophotometer, then the wavelength of the light reflected off that ‘blood’ would be the same, no matter the surrounding colours. But our eyes don’t see the world as it really is because our eyes don’t measure wavelengths like a spectrophotometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale Purves, the George B Geller Professor of Neurobiology (Emeritus) at Duke University in North Carolina, thinks that, because we can never really see the world accurately, the brain’s primary purpose is to help us make associations to guide our behaviour in a way that, literally, makes sense. Purves sees ‘making sense’ as an active process where the brain produces inferences, of which we are not consciously aware, based on past experiences, to interpret and construct a coherent picture of our surroundings. Our brains use learned patterns and expectations to compensate for our imperfect senses and finite experiences, to give us the best understanding of the world &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;urves is the scientist’s scientist. He pursues the questions he’s genuinely interested in and does so with original approaches and ideas. Over the years, he’s changed the subject of his research multiple times, all with the intent of understanding how the brain works, tackling subjects that were new and unfamiliar to him, as opposed to chasing trends and techniques or sticking to a tried-and-true research path. His career is an instance of the claim &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/in-times-of-crisis-the-arts-are-weapons-for-the-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Viktor Frankl&lt;/a&gt; makes in &lt;em&gt;Man’s Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt; (1946): ‘For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself …’ If success is measured by accolades, then it did indeed follow Purves’s pursuits. Among a laundry list of awards and honours, he’s one of the few scientists elected both to the National Academy of Sciences (1989) and to what is now the National Academy of Medicine (1996). Election to either is considered to be among the highest honours that can be bestowed on a scientist in the United States. Nevertheless, if the name ‘Dale Purves’ sounds familiar to you, it is likely because you took a neuroscience course in college, for which the textbook was &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; by Purves et al (one of the most popular and &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/neuroscience-9780197616246?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;7th edition).&lt;/span&gt; Indeed, this is the text I used when I taught an introductory neuroscience course at Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Purves’s passion for neuroscience took time and experience to materialise. As an undergraduate at Yale, he struggled initially but found a major – philosophy – intending to pursue medicine. Purves developed an interest in science but didn’t know anything about being a scientist, and medicine seemed close enough. In 1960, he entered Harvard Medical School thinking he would become a psychiatrist. In his first year, he took a course on the nervous system, taught by young hotshot neuroscientists, some of whom would go on to be among the greats of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; (and whose work is now textbook material): David Potter, Ed Furshpan, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (the latter two won the Nobel Prize in 1981, along with Roger Sperry). Purves finished his medical degree in 1964, but he had grown disillusioned with psychiatry. He’d tried switching to general surgery, but realised he lacked the intensity of interest in surgery required to excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 1965, and the Vietnam War gave him time to think. Purves was drafted but, as a physician, could serve his time as a Peace Corps employee, which he did in Venezuela. There, he said, he came across a book, &lt;em&gt;The Machinery of the Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1963) by Dean Wooldridge, that synthesised what he learned years ago in that first-year course on the nervous system. The book was written for the lay reader and shared the current knowledge about the brains of humans and other animals. Its particular angle was to compare the brain to the computer technology of the time. The book reignited Purves’s interest in the brain, which was first piqued in his medical school course. When he returned to the US, Purves would begin again as a researcher in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;There were more neurons in the developing embryo than there would be in the adult chicken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an undergraduate at the University of Idaho when I first read Purves’s work. It was the early 1990s and I was a philosophy major like Purves but was really interested in neuroscience. So I sought hands-on research experience in a professor’s lab in the biology department. We were studying the immune-system markers of motor neurons in the rat’s spinal cord, the ones that connect to leg muscles causing them to contract. Mark DeSantis, my advisor, suggested a book by Purves. At the time, there were few courses or serious books on the brain. Purves’s &lt;em&gt;Body and Brain: A Trophic Theory of Neural Connections&lt;/em&gt; (1988) was perfect, just what I needed. Its central thesis is that the survival of neurons making connections, and the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of these connections, is regulated by the targets of those neuronal connections. In essence, he was telling us that, unlike the static circuit board of a computer, which is carefully designed and built according to a plan, the circuits of the nervous system are constructed on the fly in accordance with signals it receives from the targets of its connections. Those targets could be other neurons, organs or muscles in the body. As a result, as the body changes over the course of development in an individual or in the evolution of species, the neural circuits will adjust accordingly. Why is this important? Purves showed us that the brain is more than just a controller of the body: it is also an organ system that is embedded in a &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dynamic relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the body, affected by body size, shape and activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Purves’s favourite examples to illustrate what sparked this theory is from the work of one of his scientific heroes, Viktor Hamburger. Hamburger had been studying central nervous system development in the 1930s, first at the University of Chicago, then as a faculty member at Washington University in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;St Louis.&lt;/span&gt; Using chicken embryos and those spinal cord motor neurons, Hamburger &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400680305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that there were more neurons in the developing embryo than there would be in the adult chicken. How could that be? Why were there more neurons in an embryo than actually needed and why did some die off? Hamburger’s idea was that the muscles targeted by those neurons supplied a limited amount of trophic, or nutrient, factors. In essence, the target muscles were producing a ‘food’ (we now call it ‘nerve growth factor’) that kept the neuron alive. The size of the target determined how much food was available and therefore how many neuron lives it could sustain. Exploiting the ease with which chick embryos could be manipulated, Hamburger showed this by first amputating one of the wing buds (ie, the nascent wing). When he did so, the final number of motor neurons on the amputated side was lower than typical, with fewer on the ‘control’ side of the spinal cord. So, the limb bud was important for the survival of neurons. If that was true, then more of this ‘target tissue’ should save more neurons. Was it possible to ‘rescue’ those extra neurons that would normally die off? To answer this question, Hamburger surgically attached an extra limb bud on one side of the embryo, thereby artificially creating more target tissue. The result: more motor neurons survived on that side of the spinal cord. In both experiments, the size of the connection target – the body, those limb buds specifically – determined the number of neurons that survived. Purves ran with this idea of a dialogic relationship between body and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;round four decades later, in the 1970s and ’80s, and Purves was now a young faculty colleague of Hamburger, his elder statesman at Washington University. Here, he took Hamburger’s theory about neuron-to-muscle connections and applied it to neuron-to-neuron connections. While he also looked at neuronal cell survival like Hamburger did, Purves also investigated the elimination and elaboration of individual connections that neurons make, their &lt;em&gt;synapses&lt;/em&gt;. This was a big leap because Purves was now testing whether or not Hamburger’s findings about death and survival of neurons in the chick embryo were peculiar to that species’ neuron-to-muscle relationship. Was the same process apparent in other developing circuits in other animals? And, if so, if a neuron survives, then are the number of connections (those synapses) also subject to competition for trophic factors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons come in all shapes and sizes, with different degrees of complexity. If you’ve seen a typical picture of a single neuron then you know it looks like a tree or bush, with a set of root-like branches on one end and a single, long limb-like branch on the other. The latter can branch as well, depending on circumstances. One of those sets of branches – the dendrites – receives inputs from other neurons, and the other – the axon – sends outputs to other neurons. Together with his graduate student Jeff Lichtman, Purves wanted to know how synapse numbers change with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7414326/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and across different &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3983631/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of animals. Purves and Lichtman started with a simple neuron-to-neuron connection, where the receiving neuron had zero dendrites and the sending neuron’s axons made synapses directly on the receiving neuron’s cell body. To see this, they would surgically remove a tight group of functionally similar neurons, known as a ‘ganglion’, from different animals. They would then carefully fill a few individual neurons with a special enzyme. When this enzyme is then given a chemical to react with, it produces a colour. This colouring allows the neuron to be visualised under a microscope in its full glory – all their branches can be seen and counted. (Imagine a microscopic glass-blown tentacled creature being filled with ink and then counting its appendages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The brain and body constitute a single, coherent and dynamic network; there is no way to separate them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of each branch represents a synaptic connection. Comparing connections in developing rats versus adults, they found that neurons initially received a few synapses from a number of different neurons. In a sense, the circuits were tangled up in young rats. By the time the rats were adults, each neuron had many synapses but only from one neuron – the circuit was untangled. How did this happen? Akin to the process of eliminating extra neurons based on target size, there was a process of elimination of superfluous connections from some neurons. Then there was an additional process of multiplication (or elaboration) of connections coming from the ‘correct’ (so to speak) neuron. In essence, once neurons could find the right partners by getting rid of the less desirable ones, their relationship could blossom in the form of additional synapses. Purves and Lichtman then replicated this basic finding with increasingly complex sets of neurons and in other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get lost in the weeds, here’s the bottom line: trophic interactions between neurons match the number of neurons to the target size, and these interactions also regulate how many synapses they make. The grander theory is this: each class of cells in a neural pathway is supporting and regulating the connections it receives by trophic interactions with the cells it’s connected to down the line. Thus, a coordinated chain of connectivity extends from neuronal connections with the body’s muscles and organs to connections among neurons within the brain itself. The brain and body constitute a single, coherent and dynamic network; there is no way to separate them. They depend on each other at every level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome artists go through distinct periods in their careers, while others stick to similar themes in and/or approaches to their work for decades. Scientists are the same. Most stick to trying to answer one particular question, getting deeper and deeper, as they figure out more and more details about their subject. Others find that, at some point, they are satisfied with the answers at hand and move on, finding a new question or challenge. Purves is the latter type of scientist, making multiple radical shifts in his scientific research. His important work supporting trophic theory had an obvious direction for continued investigation: using molecular tools to find new ways to visualise synaptic development. Purves was not interested. His research programme up to this time exploited easily manipulated and unambiguously visualised neural circuits in the peripheral nervous system. The brain itself is a different story, there where all the important action supposedly is; its complexity and density make it impossible to address the same questions – which connections are disappearing or multiplying – with the same degree of clarity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience was changing as well. By the time the late 1980s and ’90s rolled around, the most attention-getting work focused on the brain, particularly in the neocortex – the part that has disproportionately increased in size in primates like us. Many who were interested in how the brain developed were inspired by those Nobel Prize-winners, Hubel and Wiesel, who elegantly demonstrated that the visual part of the neocortex had a critical period of development. At this point, Purves had reached middle age, and he was at an impasse. The answer to the question ‘What to do next?’ was not self-evident. As an academic scientist, one can pretty much study whatever one wants, but it has to be interesting, potentially impactful and, for Purves especially, it has to be tractable: you should be able to formulate a clear hypothesis that could lead to an unambiguous finding. The answer came in the form of a new collaborator, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, who joined his lab in 1988 as a postdoctoral fellow after completing his PhD on the development of the neocortex. Together, Purves and LaMantia decided to tackle the question ‘How does the brain grow?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Mice were not born with their full set of glomeruli; over the course of development, new ones were added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of brains, as many as there are animals. There is a beauty in all of them, perhaps because they adhere quite nicely to the form-follows-function principle of design. The designer in each case is natural selection’s influence on how a species develops, and thus the form its body and brain take in response to environmental challenges. Brain scientists study the anatomy of these solutions when we use any number of techniques like tracers, stains, imaging, etc. Each technique is suited to looking at the brain at a particular spatial scale. Consistently, what they reveal is that the brain is beautiful, sometimes stunning. At one of those scales, you can see repeated patterns of neural circuitry, or &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, that look exactly like the spots and stripes we see on the skin of so many animals. For example, depending on what dyes you use to stain it, the visual cortex of primates has a pattern of stripes, with each stripe seemingly dedicated to the visual signals coming from one of our two eyes. Stain it another way, and you’ll see an array of ‘blobs’ that are claimed by some to be dedicated to colour processing. Other animals have different patterns: rats have an array of barrel-shaped modules in their somatosensory (touch) cortex which corresponds to their array of facial whiskers. Dolphins have blobs in their auditory cortex; we don’t know what their &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;function is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves wanted to know how these iterated patterns of neural circuitry developed. He started by first looking just outside the neocortex, in the olfactory bulb of the mouse. In this structure, mice have a number of modules known as ‘glomeruli’. The olfactory bulbs of mice jut out from the main part of the brain and so are more accessible for experiments. Purves and LaMantia developed a method for exposing the bulbs in a live animal and staining the glomeruli with a dye that would not hurt the mice. They could then see that mice were not born with their full set of glomeruli; over the course of development, new ones were added. This was exciting and surprising because many popular theories at the time argued that brain development is mainly the result of selecting useful circuits from a larger repertoire of possible circuits. Here, they were showing that useful circuits were actually being constructed, not selected. Moreover, if circuits were constructed in this way after the animal is born, then the circuits might be influenced by experience. Were other modules in other species and brain areas added in the same way? In the macaque monkey visual cortex (ie, the experimental animal most closely related to humans and the brain area that is among the most studied) they couldn’t look at module development like they did in the mouse (looking at the same brain structure in the same animal repeatedly over time), but they were able to count the number of blobs in young monkeys versus adult monkeys. Unlike the glomeruli in mice, however, the number of blobs remained constant over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Purves, this was not super exciting. He had hoped to find more traction on perhaps a new process of neocortex development in primates, one that he could elaborate into a novel research programme. Nevertheless, he did come to one important conclusion. It seemed that most scientists – indeed, many luminaries of neuroscience – wanted to see brain modules as fundamental features of the neocortex, each serving a particular behavioural or perceptual purpose. For example, one ‘barrel’ in the rat’s touch cortex is there to process the inputs of one whisker on its face. Purves pointed out that iterated patterns of modules may be found in one species’ brain but absent in a closely related species. Moreover, he also noted that they don’t seem to be obligatorily linked to function. ‘Blobs’ are there in the human and the monkey visual cortex and are linked to colour-vision processing, but nocturnal primates with poor colour vision still have blobs in their visual cortex. So, the blobs do not seem to enable colour vision. Similarly, chinchillas have a barrel cortex like rats but don’t have the whisker movements of rats. Cats and dogs have whiskers but no related modules in their touch cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it seems that, while the iterated patterns of the brain are beautiful, they are unlike modern architecture in that their beauty is not linked to function. So why then do they form at all? Here, Purves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016622369290180G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that iterated patterns are the result of synaptic connections finding and relying on each other and then making more of those connections in pathways that are most active. In other words, the iterated patterns of the brain are epiphenomenal, the byproducts of the rules of neural connections and competing patterns of neural activity. Those activity patterns are generated by sensory inputs coming from the sensory organs – the eyes, ears, nose and skin. So seeing beautiful-looking patterns in the brain does not necessarily mean they were constructed for a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I &lt;/span&gt;first met Purves in 1993 when I was interviewing for graduate school after he had moved to Duke University. I had already read a lot of his work and was in awe of his contrarian instincts and pursuit of work that is out of the mainstream yet important. When I entered his office for my interview, I was extremely nervous but managed to ask about the portraits on his office walls. They were scientists. John Newport Langley, a 19th-century British physiologist who made important discoveries about neurotransmitters. He inspired the problems Purves tackled as a new professor. The aforementioned Viktor Hamburger was also there. He was a major figure in 20th-century embryology and also a good friend of Purves, despite the difference in their ages and experience. Another photo was of Stephen Kuffler, perhaps the most beloved figure in neuroscience at the time and who made key discoveries in vision. Kuffler had organised the neuroscience team who taught Purves when he was in medical school, and Purves considers him a mentor who exemplified what to pursue (and what not to pursue) in neuroscience. The final photo was of Bernard Katz, a Nobel laureate who figured out how neurons communicate with muscles. Purves collaborated with Katz in the 1970s and considers him a paragon of scientific excellence. I was admitted to Duke and, a year later, moved to Durham, North Carolina hoping to study with Purves or LaMantia, who was there too as a new professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Duke, Purves was about to make a major change, away from studying the brain itself entirely. This seemed kind of crazy after so much success with discoveries about the developing nervous system, building an enviable career and becoming a sought-after leader in the field. But Purves’s restless instinct arose again and he switched his focus, this time to study perception. He had a hunch that the great advances wowing people about brain anatomy and the function of circuits therein were not going to be enough to make it clear how the brain works in actually guiding human behaviours. The origin of the hunch was in philosophy, which Purves had majored in as an undergraduate. The philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) had noticed that our eyeballs take in radically different-sized, three-dimensional objects and then project them back onto the retina (the sensory wall in the back of the eye) in exactly the same size and only in two dimensions (known as the inverse optics problem). This is why framing a distant human’s whole body between your two fingers, seemingly able to crush them, is amusing. It uses forced perspective to imply an impossibility. The implication of the inverse problem is profound. It means that the information about the object (the source) coming into our brain is uncertain, incomplete, partial.&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a solution to the inverse problem, the scientist Hermann von Helmholtz &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1821-94)&lt;/span&gt; proposed that perception relied on learning from experience. We learn about objects through trial and error, and make inferences about any ambiguous image. Thus, since we have no experiences with lilliputian human beings, we can infer that the tiny human in the forced-perspective example is actually far away. Purves took the seed of Helmholtz’s idea – that our perception depends on experience – and built an entire research programme around it. Since the mid-1990s, he and his collaborators have systematically analysed a variety of visual illusions in brightness, contrast, motion, and geometry. They have shown that our perceptions are experience-based constructions, not accurate reflections of their sources in the real world. The example of ‘red’ from the beginning of this essay is based on his colour work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Our ability to perceive accurately is largely based on past experiences and learned associations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves and his collaborator Beau Lotto would generate two identically coloured ‘target’ squares on a computer screen but give them backgrounds of different colours. The backgrounds would make the two squares look like they were different colours (even though they were actually identical, as measured by a spectrophotometer). Then, participants were asked to adjust the hue, saturation and brightness (the same controls on your phone’s camera app) of the target squares until they looked identical. Each participant’s adjustments were quantified and used as a difference measure between perception and reality. Ultimately, Purves’s research led to the conclusion that the brain functions on a wholly empirical basis. We construct our perception of the world through our past experiences in that world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a radical departure from the long-standing prevailing orthodoxy that the brain extracts features from objects and other sensory sources only to recombine them to guide our behaviour. Instead of extracting features and combining them in the brain (red+round = apple), Purves argues that it is our learned associations among an event or feature of the world, the context in which it appeared and the consequences of our subsequent actions that builds our umwelt, our self-centred world. The research of Purves and his collaborators showed that our ability to perceive accurately is largely based on past experiences and learned associations. This means that we must learn about the space around us, the objects in it and other aspects of perception; these are not innate but developed through interaction with the environment. This all seems very reasonable. The environment is always in flux, with different challenges at different times for any animal. You wouldn’t want your brain fine-tuned to an environment in which you no longer live. Equally, it also wouldn’t make sense for a species to build each individual’s brain as a &lt;em&gt;tabula rasa&lt;/em&gt;, to start from scratch with every generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves’s findings and interpretation lead to a more philosophical puzzle. To what extent is the ‘environment’ that the brain is trying to make sense of actually ‘out there’ beyond our heads? Is there a real reality? Purves has shown that, even if there is a real reality, we don’t perceive much of it… or at least we don’t have a universal way of perceiving it. For example, not all humans see the same colours the same way. There are two reasons for this. One is that colour and its interpretation depend highly on environmental factors. The other is that perception also depends on experience. Experiences depend on your interaction with specific environments. Do you live in the sea, on land, in burrows, in a nest or in a climate-controlled house? Do you have vision, or are you blind? What do your physiology and anatomy allow you to perceive and interact with? What have you seen before? Your perception and interpretation of the world, and indeed those of other animals, depend on the answers to these types of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n her memoir &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&lt;/em&gt; (1974), Annie Dillard writes about coming across a book on vision, which shows what happens when blind humans of all ages are suddenly given the ability to see. Does experience really determine how we see and act in the world? That book was &lt;em&gt;Space and Sight&lt;/em&gt; (1960). In it, Marius von Senden describes how patients who were blind at birth because of cataracts saw the world when those cataracts were removed. Were they able to see the world as we see it, those of us with vision since birth? No. Most patients did not. In one example from the book, Dillard recounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the operation a doctor would give a blind patient a cube and a sphere; the patient would tongue it or feel it with his hands, and name it correctly. After the operation the doctor would show the same objects to the patient without letting him touch them; now he had no clue whatsoever what he was seeing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even an example of a patient finally ‘seeing’ her mother but at a distance. Because of a lack of experience, she failed to understand the relationship between size and distance (forced perspective) that we learn from experience with sight. When asked how big her mother was, she set her two fingers a few inches apart. These types of experiments (which have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17201779/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;replicated&lt;/a&gt; in various ways) show just how important experience and learned associations are to making sense of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Purves has enough studies to show an operating principle of the nervous system or – more cautiously, he would say – ‘how it seems to work’. The function of the nervous system is to make, maintain and modify neural associations to guide adaptive behaviours – those that lead to survival and reproduction – in a world that sensory systems cannot accurately capture. It is not a stretch to link Purves’s work, all the way back, on trophic theory to the current ideas. A biological agent must assemble, without any blueprint or instructions, a nervous system that matches the shape and size of a changing body. This nervous system, paired with sensory organs that filter the world in peculiar ways, must somehow process the physical states of the world in order to guide behaviour. Similar principles – neural activity, changing synaptic connections – that guided development also guide our ongoing perceptions of an ever-changing world. We use our individual experiences to do this guiding. If we happen to perceive or interpret events like other human beings, it is because we have similar bodies &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;shared similar experiences at some point. To my experience, &lt;em&gt;Purves &lt;/em&gt;is a paragon of scientific excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Purves first identifies a big, interesting question, and then finds whatever means are necessary to find the answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked Purves how he thought of the arc of his career, and it was very different from my perception of it. From my perspective, it seems that Purves’s question is always ‘How is a nervous system built?’ Addressing this question took him to increasingly large scales: from trophic theory and neural connections in the peripheral nervous system to neural construction of the brain (iterated patterns; growth of the neocortex) to the relationships between brain-area size and perceptual acuity to the construction of ‘reality’ via experience. I asked him what he thought about this narrative, and he responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That is one way of framing it, but I don’t really see a narrative arc. As you know, one’s work is often driven by venal/trivial considerations such as what research direction has a better chance of winning grant support or addressing the popular issues of the day. The theme you mention (how nervous systems are built) was not much in my thinking, although in retrospect that narrative seems &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to fit.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither one of us is wrong. In fact, we are interpreting the body of work according to our own experiences and how it best suits our needs, just as his research would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves’s remarkable research insights are the product of his distinctive approach to science. A popular approach in neuroscience is to identify one problem early in a career and to just keep plugging away, learning more and more details about it. Then, maybe acquire an exciting new technique – like fMRI in the 1990s or optogenetics in the 2000s – to investigate the same problem in a different way. Or adopt the new technique and then search for a new question that could be answered by that method. Another approach would be to just apply the method, collect some data and only then ask what story can be told with those data. None of these approaches is ‘wrong’, but Purves’s scientific approach is in stark contrast to this. He first identifies a big, interesting question, one that could possibly have a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, and then finds whatever means are necessary to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, there is a lot of thought behind his work and approach, and there is a lot of thought about what any findings may mean in the big picture of brain science. Purves is always engaged. Very few scientists have impactful work in multiple domains of their field. Purves increased our understanding of brain development, from small circuits to big ones, and from bodily experience to a new way of thinking about how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:03:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Additionally, the study found that both rice and wheat showed the same impact on diabetes and obesity and noted that overall protein intake in India remains suboptimal, averaging 12% of daily calories, with the highest at 14% in the Northeast, according R.M. Anjana, lead author of the study, Department of Diabetology, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai. “We also investigated the associations between dietary factors and metabolic risk, and evaluated the effects of isocaloric substitution of macronutrients on glycaemia and adiposity,’’ noted researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;What data was used?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/31-million-more-indians-became-diabetic-between-2019-2021-says-study/article66949970.ece" target="_self"&gt;national Indian Council of Medical Research –India Diabetes Survey (18,090 adults)&lt;/a&gt; where researchers had examined India’s dietary profile and the effect of isocaloric substitution of carbohydrates with other macronutrients on metabolic risk. The ICMR-INDIAB study was a national cross-sectional population-based survey conducted from November 2008 to December 2020. The largest survey of its kind in India, it was conducted by the ICMR to assess the prevalence of metabolic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in a nationally representative sample. Dietary data from every fifth participant were used to characterize India’s dietary profile across regions and examine inter-regional and intraregional differences in macronutrient intakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey reported (weighted for region, age and sex) prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes as 11.4% and 15.3%, respectively. The prevalence of generalized obesity and abdominal obesity was also high at 28.6% and 39.5%, respectively. NCDs account for 6.3 million (68%) of all deaths in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The diet-health connection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study found that &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/indias-burden-of-malnutrition-and-obesity-where-diet-makes-or-breaks/article69610105.ece" target="_self"&gt;unhealthy diets contribute substantially to the NCD burden&lt;/a&gt;. Improving diet and physical activity can prevent nearly 50% of the incident of type 2 diabetes (T2D). “Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. India, home to nearly 20% of the global population, has undergone rapid nutrition and epidemiological transitions over the past two decades, resulting in an alarming increase in NCD prevalence,’’ warned the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, data from epidemiological studies and national nutrition surveys, such as those by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and National Sample Survey Organisation, indicate that Indian adults currently consume ~65% to 75% of calories from carbohydrates (one of the highest in the world), 9–11% from proteins and 14–23% from fats. Recommendations for a balanced diet state that only 50-55% of total calories should from carbohydrates, with no more than 45% coming from cereals and millets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Economic costs of bad diet&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2060, the economic costs of overweight and obesity are projected to reach $839 billion (2.47% of the nation’s GDP). Given the enormous public health burden of NCDs and their associated economic costs, it is crucial to identify cost-effective, practical strategies for reducing NCD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- October 06, 2025 02:29 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 08:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国国立卫生研究院命令我停止“危险的”功能获取研究。它一点也不危险- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/06/gain-of-function-research-tuberculosis-expert-nih/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 11, I received a letter from the National Institutes of Health ordering me to stop my research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, because the work was deemed too “dangerous.” Surely this must be a mistake, I thought, since my lab has been operating safely for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am an associate professor of molecular and cell biology at University of California, Berkeley, where I study TB. I’m also a principal investigator on two grants from the NIH in which experiments using routine techniques were abruptly flagged as possible “dangerous gain-of-function research.” My work isn’t dangerous, but stopping research that could lead to cures could be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In wealthy countries, people think TB is a disease of the past. Advances in medicine and public health have virtually eradicated it from the U.S. and western Europe. Yet globally, TB kills more people than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;any other infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; and is also becoming more difficult to treat as drug resistance increases. If we lose the ability to treat TB with existing drugs, the whole world, including the United States, is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in my lab and many others across the country are striving to perform research that is essential for the discovery of new drugs to eradicate TB and prevent its worldwide resurgence. The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/tuberculosis-kansas-city-missouri-tb-outbreak-treatment/"&gt;2024-25 TB outbreak in Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; — more than 100 cases, making it the largest in the U.S. in decades — is a clear reminder that the risk is not just theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technically, my work on TB &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;involve gain of function, a category of research that has been both politicized and widely misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Gain of function” is a broad category of research that involves genetically altering an organism to give it new abilities. Gain-of-function experiments have been crucial for increasing our understanding of bacteria like M. tuberculosis in the pursuit of discovering new treatments. These techniques have also been essential in developing new therapies for cancer, new vaccines, and treatments to improve crop resiliency and animal health. Gain-of-function research has provided enormous benefits for clinical therapies, including the hepatitis B vaccine, CAR T-cells for cancer, and modified adenoviruses used in gene therapies for muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH letter terminating my research cited a May executive order in which the president ordered a stop to “dangerous gain-of-function research.” That is a very small subset of gain-of-function research, in which a potentially disease-causing organism is made more virulent, more transmissible, or more capable of infecting new hosts. Because this type of research can be risky, I fully support requiring robust safety measures to ensure it is conducted responsibly. Decisions designating research as “dangerous” must be transparent, deliberative, and scientifically informed. This approach is vital to prevent the unwarranted curtailment of safe research that serves the public good.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My grants were flagged as “dangerous” by NIH officials for two common practices in TB research that have been used safely for decades. First, to pinpoint the weaknesses of M. tuberculosis, we create genetic mutations that disable specific genes. These mutations actually make the bacterium less virulent — the opposite goal of gain-of-function research. Second, we often use resistance to kanamycin, an antibiotic not used to treat humans because of severe side effects, to isolate mutated strains. The kanamycin kills all of the bacteria except for that which is resistant. We use kanamycin resistance as a molecular marker — like a genetic ID badge — that allows us to identify and isolate the small percentage of bacteria in a population that we have successfully modified, since only these bacteria can survive when exposed to the antibiotic kanamycin. Our kanamycin-resistant strains are fully treatable by all clinically used antibiotics and cannot spread drug resistance to other strains, so they pose no risk to the public. The use of kanamycin has not been considered dangerous by any reasonable definition, and that has been true for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our techniques are essential to lifesaving TB research. Yet my colleagues across the country have also received letters targeting practices that have been proven safe over decades and remain crucial to finding new drugs and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the TB research targeted by the NIH uses standard approaches that adhere to very strict laboratory guidelines and that have been reviewed by institutional committees of scientists, biosafety experts, and members of the public. My work is conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 facility with stringent requirements: personal protective equipment, including protective clothing and respiratory protection; only working with live bacteria within biosafety cabinets that prevent release of organisms into the environment; and using rooms with specialized ventilation to provide an additional layer of containment.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Limiting dangerous gain-of-function research is an important goal. But effective oversight must utilize scientific knowledge to distinguish between low-risk and actual, demonstrable threats so that we do not impede progress against deadly diseases for no real safety benefit. An overly broad approach, with the resulting ramifications for lifesaving research we’re already seeing, could be exacerbated by the recently proposed “Risky Research Review Act.” Without clear definitions, scientific expertise, and streamlined review processes, lifesaving research could be stopped. This would be an even bigger threat to public health than the broad, misinformed definition of “dangerous” that is being applied here. &lt;/p&gt;

after an accident - he had been given a blood transfusion at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Campbell went back to the doctors for a test and they confirmed hepatitis C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Maegan says Campbell was a good dad at first&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The virus had been undiagnosed for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Known as the "silent killer", hep C may cause few symptoms initially, with early signs including night sweats, brain fog, itchy skin and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But for every year a person carries the virus, their chance of dying from liver cirrhosis and related cancers increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meagan, who is now 28, says her father was angry that it had taken so long to get a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I also felt at the time he felt a little bit of shame too, he didn't want anyone to know, just wanted to keep it to himself, but mostly angry, we all were," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Campbell died in 2024, at the age of 61, just five years after finding out he had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Over those last few years he wasn't himself," Maegan says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"He wasn't the dad that I knew. He had a lot of brain fog, it affected him, it affected his personality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Maegan wonders what their relationship might have been, had they known Campbell was genuinely very ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I feel a lot of guilt a lot," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If I'd known then, what I know now, I think our relationship would have been a lot different.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I myself have suffered a lot of mental health problems because of the breakdown of my relationship with my dad.

affected, the UK government ordered an inquiry, conducted by Sir Brian Langstaff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Last year, his main report found that along with donations being sought from high-risk groups, donors were not routinely screened before September 1991, despite the risk of bloodborne viruses being known about since the 1940s.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Shockingly, it also found that the government, civil service and NHS, over decades tried to cover up and deny this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In October 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government had set aside £11.8bn to pay compensation to victims via the Infected Blood Compensation Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Before he died Campbell McPhee got an interim payment of £100,000 from the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, there's been criticism that full compensation is glacially slow in being paid out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Earlier this year Sir Brian called the delay in providing it to victims as creating "an injustice all of its own".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Lawyer Jamie Lyons

bJoRPJ"&gt;Jamie Lyons, of the legal firm Thorntons, who represents Maegan, has dozens of clients angry about the length of time it's taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says: "The scheme has just ground to a halt as far as we are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The vast majority of cases that we have are all just sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We can't really do much until the full scheme opens up and the date for that is repeatedly being pushed back."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He added: "There's a risk people are dying, whilst they wait for these schemes to open up for payments to be made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Lyons says there could be people affected that don't know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I think there's people going around that don't have the slightest idea that they may have been infected due to this," he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"They could be getting treated for other illnesses that they've been told they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've certainly seen that, people being given the wrong diagnosis, people being told it could have been something else that's contributed to the infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A spokesperson said people have waited decades for recognition and compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Since we were established and began the very first claims late last year, our priority has been to pay as many people as quickly as possible," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Today, we have opened claims for almost all of the living infected people who are registered with a support scheme (almost 3,500 people so far) and made more than £1bn in compensation offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We have accepted the recommendations in the Infected Blood Inquiry's Additional Report and by the end of the year, we will have opened the service to some people from every group making a compensation claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This will include those people who are infected and have never received any compensation, those claiming on behalf of deceased infected people who were sadly never able to make their claim, and those who are affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;More than 3,000 people have died in the UK, and thousands more live with health conditions as a result of this scandal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Maegan, it's not about the money, its about pain, apology and acknowledgement for the victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I want everyone to know what the NHS did to these people and my dad and not just the people who have been infected but their families and everybody that loves them because it has a ripple effect," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I want acknowledgement and I want them to be

&lt;p id="58607f27-a0e2-4f21-a564-084d4e606eab"&gt;It’s normal to have exercise preferences. Maybe your heart sings every time you get to do a biceps curl, or you’re a fiend for sit-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also normal to find certain moves more difficult than others—and according to Peloton trainer Ben Alldis, there’s a certain set of moves beginners usually dislike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="58607f27-a0e2-4f21-a564-084d4e606eab-2"&gt;“People find lower-body strength really challenging to begin with,” says Alldis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging the large muscles in your legs and rear can be tiring, and the subsequent DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness) can be uncomfortable, but Alldis insists that it’s all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can actually get an incredible workout from lower-body training that offers more than just lower-body strength,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower-body workouts engage large muscle groups like your quads and glutes, which will push your heart rate up and challenge your cardio fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, keeping your lower-body muscles strong and mobile will help you remain able to perform functional movements as you age, like walking, running and climbing stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jj8cyirSrNPUrhGBvyGp2S" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jj8cyirSrNPUrhGBvyGp2S slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the Peloton trainer’s three favorite moves to do at home—all you need to do them is a set of dumbbells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-squat" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

It’s a movement that mimics getting in and out of a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-lunge" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

Whether one is preparing a basic dal tadka, or quick salad, a handful of chopped onions usually finds it way to the mix! While most of us treat onions as a flavour basic, very few realise what it actually offers in terms of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. William Li, a well-known physician and researcher in the field of nutrition and food, shared his enlightening thoughts on a unique variety of onions he found at the farmers' market. Not the appearance but nutritionally, what red onions can do is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The colour tells a story&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep reddish-purple colour of the red onions is not just "there", it is more than a visual appeal. The vibrant shade of onions comes from a compound called anthocyanins, they are natural antioxidants. These are also found in different foods, jamun, strawberries and eggplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wondering what anthocyanins can do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other antioxidant, anthocyanins also help protect the body from oxidative stress, in simpler words, they reduce cell damage when consumed in the form of food, supporting immune system and help fight inflammation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation has been proved to be the root cause of all diseases such as diabetes, heart related ailments and even joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something as simple as red onions, when consumed along with meals or in meals can help the body stay balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The hero compound: Quercetin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really sets onions apart, is the plant based component called as quercetin, which is basically a flavonoid, that acts a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quercetin related research has proved its potential role in reducing blood pressure, improving heart health and even fighting against certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384403/#sec6-pharmaceuticals-16-01020" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;about the recent advances in potential health benefits of quercetin, in PubMed central shows that Emerging evidence suggests that quercetin may be a potent player in the fight against viral infections. Its antiviral properties, which extend to combatting influenza, hepatitis B and C viruses, and HIV, make it an appealing candidate for future antiviral therapies. Researchers are hopeful that with further development, quercetin-based medications could revolutionize the treatment of viral diseases, potentially reducing the burden of global health crises. One of the most exciting revelations is quercetin’s anticancer potential. Studies have shown that it can hinder cancer cell proliferation and trigger apoptosis in various cancer types, including breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Li points out that quercetin works quietly in the background, helping the body control inflammation, and supporting overall health, and onions are the best natural sources of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Onions in traditional and modern cuisines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Indian cooking, onions are already a core ingredient. Whether raw or cooked, they play a big role in flavour and texture. but now, we also know that their health value is just as strong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belonging to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0254629924000528" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;allium family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which also includes, garlic, shallots, and leeks, all of which are common components of both Mediterranean and Asian diets. Allium species have been recommended in traditional medicine for its efficacy in treating a variety of diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, diabetes, colds, flu, headache, cough, hemorrhage, atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer, colic and skin problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike imported vegetables and fruits, onions are available in every local market.

			&lt;p&gt;A component of fossil fuel emissions could contribute to an increased risk of the neurodegenerative disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis"&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Canada matched 304 people diagnosed with ALS with 1,207 healthy people of the same age and sex. They estimated each individual's exposure to pollutants based on &lt;a href="https://canue.ca/data-tools/canue-data/"&gt;environmental records&lt;/a&gt; on the location of their primary residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the researchers compared measures of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a compound produced by the combustion of coal and oil-based fuels. Previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/c6tx00314a"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to brain damage, the pollutant had not been studied in relation to ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-hairstyle-could-generate-pollution-on-par-with-busy-traffic"&gt;Your Hairstyle Could Generate Pollution on Par With Busy Traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that those diagnosed with ALS in their sample had "a significantly higher history" of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association doesn't prove direct cause and effect, it's a strong link and a worrying finding – especially as all the areas covered by the study were well within &lt;a href="https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report"&gt;the official guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for 'clean' air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings support the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide, and the development of ALS, supporting the need for improved air pollution control measures," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176270" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract" class="wp-image-176270 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract-600x203.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176270" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Of the pollutants examined, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the only one with a significant link to ALS. (Saucier et al., &lt;em&gt;Environ. Res.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) – also a by-product of car fumes and coal-fired power stations – has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1115"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to ALS risk, but this analysis didn't show any meaningful association after adjusting for other factors (including socioeconomic factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that levels of sulfur dioxide prior to symptoms appearing were far more critical than measures taken in years before a diagnosis, suggesting individuals were often at a 'point of no return' by the time they were evaluated by medical specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to highlight that higher levels of ambient SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in residential areas relate to an increased risk of ALS," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ALS &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000351153"&gt;remains rare&lt;/a&gt;, with around &lt;a href="https://alsnc.org/understanding-als/who-gets-als/"&gt;1 to 2 new cases per 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; per year reported worldwide, its effects are devastating. The condition gradually destroys nerve cells to cause paralysis, and in the majority of cases is fatal within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to discover more about ALS, but its cause is yet to be determined – there's typically no family history of the condition, for instance. Risk factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vigorous-physical-activity-linked-to-increased-risk-of-developing-als-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-mnd"&gt;physical exercise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-als-identified-in-children-with-rare-genetic-mutations"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt;, have been identified, but overall, the picture isn't a clear one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that a combination of factors combine to put the necessary mechanisms in motion, and from this and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114510"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;, it seems probable that air pollution is among them. Of course, we also know that the same smog of modern living has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-isnt-only-bad-for-lungs-say-studies-its-also-bad-for-mental-health"&gt;poor mental health&lt;/a&gt;, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this latest study are keen to see further investigations into the effects of pollutants on ALS risk, and suggest that air quality regulations should be tighter – even as fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-how-much-fossil-fuel-the-world-is-sitting-on-and-its-a-time-bomb"&gt;continue to burn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a necessity for prevention strategies and improved regulatory intervention on behalf of public health on air pollution exposure levels," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And as the aging population grows, Alzheimer’s disease rates are expected to balloon from a current 7 million to about 13 million in the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rich &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14125671/secret-hidden-chillies-heart-disease-dementia.html"&gt;in anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; and antioxidant compounds, these everyday spices represent a promising, natural avenue for preventing both threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cooking with spices cumin, saffron, sumac, and cardamom may help reduce the risk of both Alzheimer's and heart disease by targeting the brain and heart's shared biological roots (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists in &lt;span&gt;a recent study, &lt;span&gt;published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482525009278#sec4" class=""&gt;Computers in Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, utilized computer simulations to explore the potential of spices in combating&lt;/span&gt; Alzheimer's and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they made a list of all the natural compounds found in 10 spices central to Saudi Arabian cuisine and traditional medicine: cumin, caraway, cardamom, saffron, sumac, ajwain, amla, assafoetida, brahmi and myrrh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These spices offer targeted benefits: sumac and saffron are powerful antioxidants (substances that protect cells from toxins); ajwain, cumin, and caraway aid digestion; cardamom and saffron can boost mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myrrh serves as a potent antiseptic - protecting against infection - amla is a Vitamin C powerhouse for the immune system, and brahmi is revered as a brain tonic for memory and anxiety in Ayurvedic medicine, a practice rooted in Indian tradition that aims to promote health by balancing the mind, body and spirit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, they contribute to a diet rich in compounds that combat oxidative stress, which is considered the root cause of aging and chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and brain decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used databases to predict which compounds in the 10 spices could be absorbed, reach the brain, and avoid causing liver damage. The initial filter prioritized compounds that the gut could absorb, cross the blood-brain barrier to reach their target and, crucially, not cause liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They zeroed in on three compounds: kaempferol, apigenin and myristic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, the team used a technique called network pharmacology to map the complex relationships between the spice compounds and the genes involved in both Alzheimer's and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Human trials show that cumin can improve key heart disease risk factors by lowering bad cholesterol and blood fats while raising good cholesterol (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Saffron is one of the most researched spices for brain health. In fact, clinical trials have found that saffron extract can improve cognitive function as effectively as a standard Alzheimer's drug (donepezil) in patients with mild to moderate symptoms (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This analysis revealed three key genes, AKT1, SRC and TP53, that function as central hubs, meaning their dysfunction is critically involved in the biological pathways of both Alzheimer's and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, they used advanced computer modeling to simulate how the most promising spice compounds would physically interact with proteins related to these key genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simulations showed that those three specific compounds bind stably to the key disease-related proteins, suggesting they could help calm harmful inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and protect cells from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another study from last month, researchers in Taiwan found that a compound in cinnamon may help fight Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03492-3"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;focused on sodium benzoate, a substance the body produces when it metabolizes certain compounds, including cinnamon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with mild Alzheimer's who took daily capsules of sodium benzoate at 500 mg, 750 mg or 1000 mg for 24 weeks showed significant improvements in cognitive function compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment worked by directly targeting a key culprit in Alzheimer's, the toxic amyloid-beta protein that forms plaques in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two higher doses of sodium benzoate significantly reduced levels of this harmful protein in the blood. The treatment was also found to be as safe as the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study showed a cinnamon-derived substance improved cognitive function and reduced a key Alzheimer's protein in patients. Another study identified a different cinnamon compound that effectively targets a major Alzheimer's gene (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research suggested that the cinnamon-derived compound could be a safer, more accessible alternative to limited and very expensive Alzheimer's treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors cautioned that they used pharmaceutical-grade doses far higher than what the average American would get from eating the cinnamon in their cupboards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A different team of researchers zeroed in on another beneficial compound in cinnamon, epicatechin, in a 2023 study published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301462223000418"&gt;Biophysical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, which revealed its exceptional ability to bind to the ApoE4 protein, a key driver of Alzheimer's risk linked to a specific genetic variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers designed modified versions of the flavonoid epicatechin by adding a specific chemical group to its structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This alteration created new compounds that bind to the ApoE4 protein far more effectively than the original molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This enhanced binding is crucial because it helps the ApoE4 protein clear away toxic amyloid-beta peptides in the brain, preventing them from clumping into the plaques that define Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, among the spices analyzed for cognitive benefits, saffron remains one of the most well-studied and promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several clinical trials have shown that saffron extract &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838862/"&gt;can be as effective&lt;/a&gt; as donepezil, a common Alzheimer's medication, in improving cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Falling birth rates and an aging population will lead to a sharp rise in Alzheimer's cases.

This new fitness trend, called “Interval Walking Training” is developed by Professors at the Shinshu University in Japan, has become a new favorite among fitness enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the &lt;keyword id="27094849" type="General" weightage="100" keywordseo="Japanese-walking-technique" source="keywords"&gt;Japanese walking technique&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is a scientifically designed exercise method where instead of a casual stroll, a combination of brisk walking and slow paced walking is alternately incorporated. The technique follows a simple rhythm: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 minutes of brisk walking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 minutes of slow walking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeating the cycle for 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Hiroshi Nore, one of the professors who developed this method says, this technique was designed to make walking more beneficial for fat burning and cardiovascular health, especially for people with sedentary lifestyle and older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Morning Habits for Longevity and Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternating between fast and slow pace is what makes this technique special. This technique activates aerobic and anaerobic systems, triggers excess post exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and stimulates mitochondrial activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisk intervals raise your heart rate and burn fat, while slow phases allow recovery but keep metabolism elevated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26950358/" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Afterburn effect&lt;/a&gt; (EPOC), meaning your body continues to burn calories for hours after the walk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Activated&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7117801/" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt; mitochondria improves energy production&lt;/a&gt;, endurance and fat metabolism. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes this technique better than jogging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study conducted at Shinshu University found that participants practicing interval walking for five months lost 3–5 kg of fat, while those walking at a steady pace saw much smaller changes. Another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.588.9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found, for older people, interval walking technique over 10 years protected against age related fitness complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shinshu University study also suggested that report improvements in VO₂ max and reductions in systolic blood pressure over several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is this technique for everyone?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple approach of this walking technique definitely makes it stand out. However, there aren’t many studies that have incorporated the Japanese walking technique. Whether you should try this method or not, depends on your individual health status. Interval walking is low-impact compared to jogging or running, so it’s generally safe for beginners, older adults, and people with sedentary lifestyles. In contrast, people with heart conditions, uncontrolled high blood pressure, joint problems, or other medical concerns should consult a healthcare professional before starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNelRXa3NvZ3M2bFAwckx6YXlFS0RvbnVYTG03RmxxUVJiVHpwNzdKSWVzYUVjMDJHMDdqdlpGOWNteG1rWHRLQTFaTEFMSEVFa2ZHWTV5VmJ0dm1BLXE3LXIydFV3NXBNUDVjb25vSGVQSG02X3Y1dEE1QWRCbURPV3pUeldscEYxU2tGa1U0ZTF3OWx1UTZ1U1N2MWV5TzNSZmZ1VzNLY1FwRURLeXlBZDlUNmRYWElIbUlDc1NPMHlyajZxSlBtcHUyWmhhaGU2MUNMVUVNMGZxbGpEOTR2OWk5VWVybWlCN0ZfR1VENkJJTW15dU5jTjFHVmpUWF9wSW9jZk1rb0dMelV2cGU1SElNQnNkRld3T19jNzhfTVJGRlV6ZkpZ</guid></item><item><title>对50万份医疗记录与阿尔茨海默氏症病毒一次又一次关联的研究- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-study-of-500000-medical-records-linked-viruses-with-alzheimers-again-and-again</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Participants with high misophonia severity struggled to shift between emotional tasks and reported rigid thinking in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition was also strongly associated with rumination, or repetitive negative thinking, which may drive or exacerbate distress. These findings suggest that misophonia is more than sensory—it involves deeper issues of emotion regulation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with misophonia showed reduced accuracy in tasks requiring emotional set-shifting, even when reaction times were unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Inflexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Self-reported cognitive rigidity was significantly correlated with misophonia, independent of depression, anxiety, and hyperacusis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rumination Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple forms of rumination—general, brooding, and anger—were strongly associated with misophonia severity and mediated the link with cognitive inflexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=misophonia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misophonia&lt;/a&gt;, the intense emotional response to everyday sounds like chewing or sniffing, has long been viewed as a sensory condition. But new research reveals it may run much deeper—tied not just to sound sensitivity, but to how the brain regulates emotion, attention, and thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new pre-registered study has found that individuals with misophonia not only struggle with emotional reactivity to triggering sounds, but also exhibit significant impairments in both&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=cognitive+flexibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; cognitive and &lt;em&gt;affective flexibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the brain’s ability to shift focus, regulate emotional response, and move between mental tasks in the face of emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that this rigidity is closely linked to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=rumination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rumination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a repetitive pattern of negative thinking seen in many forms of mental distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a crucial window into misophonia’s cognitive profile, highlighting that what’s often assumed to be “just” a reaction to sound may in fact involve broader, transdiagnostic processes of emotional regulation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond the Sound: The Brain’s Role in Misophonia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misophonia, affecting an estimated 5% to 20% of the population, is characterized by extreme discomfort or even rage triggered by specific sounds, often involving orofacial human noises (like chewing or throat-clearing). Though not yet listed in the DSM-5 or ICD-11, misophonia is increasingly recognized as a condition with serious life impacts—ranging from social avoidance to workplace difficulties and emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, until now, misophonia has largely been approached through the lens of auditory processing or sensory hypersensitivity. What this new study reveals is that underlying cognitive and emotional traits—namely &lt;em&gt;inflexibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rumination&lt;/em&gt;—may be critical in shaping misophonic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the &lt;em&gt;Memory and Affective Flexibility Task (MAFT)&lt;/em&gt;, a novel neurocognitive paradigm designed to measure how participants shift between memory-based and emotionally driven tasks. Unlike traditional tasks that use neutral stimuli, the MAFT incorporates emotionally evocative images to better capture real-world emotional demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Affective Flexibility and the Cost of Switching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the core findings was that individuals with clinically significant misophonia showed &lt;em&gt;reduced affective flexibility&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, participants with higher misophonia severity performed worse on switch trials where they had to rapidly shift from one emotional evaluation to another—such as reappraising whether an image was emotionally positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difficulty wasn’t simply about slow reaction times; in fact, reaction time was not correlated with misophonia severity. Instead, the impairment was in &lt;em&gt;switch accuracy&lt;/em&gt;—indicating a breakdown in the ability to shift cognitive sets in response to emotionally salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these flexibility deficits persisted even after controlling for general cognitive rigidity, anxiety, depression, and hyperacusis, suggesting a specific and independent role for &lt;em&gt;affective switching&lt;/em&gt; in misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cognitive Inflexibility and Broader Mental Rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside behavioral task data, participants also completed the &lt;em&gt;Detail and Flexibility Questionnaire (DFlex)&lt;/em&gt;—a validated self-report measure of cognitive flexibility. Here too, the results were striking: misophonia severity was &lt;em&gt;strongly and positively associated&lt;/em&gt; with cognitive inflexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, individuals with misophonia not only struggled with moment-to-moment emotional shifts in a lab task—they also reported a &lt;em&gt;trait-like&lt;/em&gt; rigidity in daily life. These patterns mirror cognitive difficulties seen in disorders commonly comorbid with misophonia, such as OCD, autism spectrum disorder, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, affective flexibility and cognitive flexibility did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correlate with one another, reinforcing the idea that they are distinct processes—each contributing independently to the misophonic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rumination: The Mental Loop That Won’t Stop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If affective inflexibility reflects difficulty shifting emotional gears, &lt;em&gt;rumination&lt;/em&gt; is the cognitive trap that keeps people stuck. Defined as repetitive, negative self-focused thought, rumination has long been implicated in depression and anxiety—but this study shows its unique relevance to misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed three different rumination scales, measuring general perseverative thinking, brooding, and anger rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three forms were significantly correlated with misophonia severity—even after controlling for anxiety and depression—suggesting that rumination is not merely a comorbid feature but a potential cognitive driver of misophonic distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, rumination did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correlate with affective flexibility (as measured by MAFT), but did strongly correlate with cognitive inflexibility—suggesting a shared underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analysis revealed that up to 43% of the link between cognitive inflexibility and misophonia could be explained by rumination, pointing to it as a key cognitive mediator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clinical Implications: More Than Sound Sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study offers a critical reframing of misophonia: not merely as a sensory disorder, but as a condition shaped by fundamental patterns of attention, flexibility, and emotion regulation. The findings raise important questions about how we classify and treat misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic interventions targeting cognitive flexibility and rumination—such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based approaches, and metacognitive training—may hold promise for reducing misophonic distress. These methods could help individuals shift away from rigid thought patterns and develop greater emotional adaptability in the face of sensory triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also emphasizes the need for clinicians to assess for broader executive function difficulties and ruminative tendencies in patients reporting misophonic symptoms. Understanding this broader cognitive-affective profile may help prevent misdiagnosis and enable more tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a New Understanding of Misophonia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating behavioral tasks, self-report measures, and a robust pre-registered design, this study offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at the cognitive underpinnings of misophonia. The evidence is clear: misophonia involves more than ears—it involves how the brain reacts, regulates, and &lt;em&gt;ruminates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should further explore these mechanisms using longitudinal designs and clinical samples, as well as investigate whether treating cognitive inflexibility and rumination can reduce symptoms over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who live with misophonia, these findings may bring hope: not just for understanding, but for interventions that go beyond silencing the world—to helping the mind &lt;em&gt;let go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694517837"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is misophonia, and how is it usually understood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Misophonia is a condition where specific sounds trigger intense emotional responses, such as irritation, anxiety, or rage—most often viewed as a sensory processing issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694538120"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What new insights does this study provide about misophonia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The study reveals that misophonia is also characterized by difficulty switching between emotional tasks, rigid thinking patterns, and high levels of rumination, suggesting a broader cognitive-emotional basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694553423"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could these findings impact treatment for misophonia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Targeting rumination and mental inflexibility through cognitive-behavioral or mindfulness-based therapies may help reduce misophonic distress and improve emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this misophonia and cognitive neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.70025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misophonia symptom severity is linked to impaired flexibility and heightened rumination&lt;/a&gt;” by Vivien K.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all protein bars are healthy—the best ones provide at least 12 grams of protein, minimal added sugar, and simple, whole food ingredients rather than additives or preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different types suit different needs, from nut- and seed-based bars packed with healthy fats, to whey or egg white bars that deliver complete proteins, to vegan-friendly plant protein options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart shopping matters—look for short ingredient lists, at least 3 grams of fiber, and no more than 10 grams of added sugar per serving to ensure your bar supports energy, satiety, and overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitian-favorite-sources-of-protein-11820661" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; remains incredibly popular within the health-focused community, leading to a booming protein-based product market—one of the most notable being the humble protein bar. Consumers reach for these bars as a snack, workout fuel, or even meal replacement (though that’s not recommended). “Protein bars are best used as a convenient snack, not a replacement for balanced meals. Whole foods should still be the foundation, with bars stepping in when you need something quick, portable, and reliable,” explains Stephanie Militano, MS, RD, CSSD, sports dietitian and owner of SM Nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In turn, the world of protein bars has become nothing short of overwhelming. In fact, the market is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; saturated with options that you could try a new brand every day for an impressively long time. However, these convenience items can be incredibly deceiving when it comes to perceived health benefits. Some deliver what they advertise—clean protein with minimal unwanted ingredients—while others are no more than a glorified candy bar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we’ll explore what makes one protein bar more or less healthy than the next, and highlight five &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; nutritious options to look for on your next grocery store run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-a-protein-bar-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes a Protein Bar Healthy? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with many packaged foods, the key to determining a protein bar's healthfulness (or lack thereof) lies in the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition facts panel and ingredients list&lt;/a&gt;. In protein bars, you primarily want to check for protein, fiber, and whole food-based ingredients—as well as fat sources, added sugar, additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, you (of course) want to check how much protein the bar contains. This macro helps us feel full after eating, stabilizes blood sugars, and supports the maintenance, growth, and repair of most tissues in the body&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—most notably muscle—among many other important benefits. “Aim for at least 12 grams of protein per bar. If using it as a meal replacement or post-workout recovery, choose bars closer to 20 grams,” shares Jessica Clancy-Strawn MA, RDN, media and kidney wellness dietitian in Houston, Texas. Ideally the protein source of your protein bar will be whole food-based—like from &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, legumes, dairy, or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthy-egg-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then, there are a few “nice to have” nutrients and ingredients in protein bars—namely &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and/or fruits and veggies. Fiber offers similar metabolic benefits as protein&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, boosting satiety after eating and managing the blood sugar response. However, it’s also tied to improved digestive regularity, cholesterol levels, and gut health as a prebiotic (or food for healthy bacteria) in the gut microbiome&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—which supports several other elements of health like immune&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and brain health&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Three grams (or more) of fiber per bar is a major added bonus. Meanwhile, fruit and veggies add micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds to your protein bar for overall health support.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Paying attention to the type of fat found in your protein bar is also important. “Favor &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; such as polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-omega-3s-than-salmon-11784373" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; and -6 fatty acids from sources like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, and seeds. Avoid saturated&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and trans fats&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially those from partially hydrogenated or refined vegetable oils, which are not heart-friendly,” explains Clancy-Strawn. Zero grams of trans fat and three grams or less of saturated fat per bar is ideal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then, when it comes to other ingredients to be wary of, be on the look out for added sugar, additives, preservatives, or artificial ingredients. “Choose bars with short, recognizable ingredient lists. Avoid preservatives and additives—especially risky ones like erythritol, carrageenan, soy lecithin, and potassium sorbate,” shares Clancy-Strawn, as these additives have been linked with stomach upset&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, unwanted heart health events&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-of-inflammation-7565179" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and fatigue&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Plus, many additives and preservatives, while technically deemed safe for consumption, lack the long-term research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; needed to truly gauge their health implications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, added sugar is a major pro-inflammatory agent&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the body that can be found in high amounts in certain protein bars. “Opt for bars with 10 grams or less of added sugars. Lower sugar and higher fiber content help manage blood sugar spikes and crashes, and support sustained appetite control,” adds Clancy-Strawn. “Non-nutritive naturally-occurring sweeteners, such as stevia or monk fruit sweetener are better options to look for in a protein bar,” Maura Fowler, MPH RDN CPH, registered dietitian and founder of Healthy You by Maura notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, many allergens can be found in protein bars—like nuts, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-seeds-11688836" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and dairy (or dairy-based components like whey and casein). If you or your loved ones have any food allergies or sensitivities, it’s important to carefully examine the food label and allergen statement prior to investing in a new protein bar option.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-protein-bars"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Protein Bars  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, there are plenty of protein bar categories that meet these criteria. Here are five of the top better-for-you options:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Primarily Nut, Seed, or Nut-Butter Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I always want to encourage protein that comes from whole foods first,” says Fowler—and nut and nut butter-based protein bars definitely fit this bill. Plus, these bars often provide additional nutrients like fiber, healthy fats, and a variety of micronutrients naturally found in the nuts, seeds, and their butters. “Nuts and seeds offer numerous health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of cancer, respiratory illness, infectious disease, and diabetes,” Clancy-Strawn adds. There are plenty of brands that offer nut, seed, or nut/seed butter-based bars. “A few of my favorite brands are Kind Bars and Larabar,” shares Militano.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Allergen-Free Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those allergic to any (or several) of the nine major allergens, there are a handful of allergen-free protein bars available. “It’s always important to be mindful of individuals who have allergies, and provide adequate options for those folks too. 88 Acres and Alio are made with simple ingredients and are free of all nine allergens,” says Fowler When searching for these bars, it’s essential to double check the food label and allergen statement before serving them to another with severe allergies or sensitivities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Whey Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whey protein-based bars contain all of the essential amino acids, which make them a great choice if you are trying to support muscle health—and they are also typically &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-have-the-most-protein-8763731" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher in protein&lt;/a&gt;,” says Militano. Fowler agrees, adding, “Whey protein continues to prove it’s an ultimate source of protein that your body can better absorb&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.” Many of the protein bars that you’ll find in grocery stores fit within this category. “Rise bars are great options that feature simple ingredients including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-cashews-7110031" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cashews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/almonds-health-benefits-6835790" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;almonds&lt;/a&gt;, or sunflower seeds, and natural sweeteners. They contain no hazardous additives, offer 16 grams of protein, a good amount of fruits and vegetables, and are low in sodium and saturated fat,” shares Clancy-Strawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Plant Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have dairy sensitivities or follow a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/easy-vegan-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt;, vegan protein bars are a smart grab. “For those who prefer dairy free or a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, these are their bars,” Fowler encourages. And there are plenty of brands offering exceptional plant-based protein bars. “Known for being gluten-free, dairy-free, seed oil-free, and free of sugar alcohols, Trubar was established in 2019 and is widely available at Target,” explains Clancy-Strawn. “Think! Plant Based Protein Bars are also low in added sugar, only 190 calories, and have minimal saturated fats,” Fowler adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Egg Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to whey-based protein bars, options that garner their protein power from eggs also offer all nine essential amino acids for a complete protein snack. Most of these bars use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/egg-white-nutrition" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;egg whites&lt;/a&gt; as a protein source, which conveniently adds protein without affecting the flavor or texture. When it comes to brands to keep an eye out for within this category, Clancy-Strawn offers, “simplicity at its finest, RXBARs feature nuts, natural flavors, egg whites, and dates, with the ingredient list proudly displayed on the front.” &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these protein bar varieties and brands are a great starting point for finding healthy options, they only scratch the surface of what's available in grocery stores nationwide.

And, in particular, she went off her food. Eventually, “She said, ‘My body is used up, and I have no will left to live’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What was unusual was that Janowitz, a biochemist at Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in the US, didn’t view this wasting away as an inevitable consequence of the disease. Instead, he was already researching ways in which this apathy could be treated — to improve people’s quality of life, and also help them live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="99ce2cbf-e2c1-4890-a8be-13e280224022"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Tobias Janowitz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;SEAN ZANNI/PATRICK MCMULLAN/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While drugs such as &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weight-loss-pill-orforglipron-nhs-0zfxhsvlt" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Ozempic &lt;/a&gt;can&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; suppress appetite, Janowitz is part of a research project looking at the biological pathways that can boost appetite — for food and for life. “Really, we want the inverse of those drugs,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The wasting away often seen in &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/half-of-urgent-cancer-diagnoses-fail-to-meet-target-time-frame-dsd89pgwc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, known as cachexia, is not unique to cancer. It was present in early Aids patients, and in people with TB — and it became known as consumption. People make a mistake, says Janowitz, of seeing this as just part of the disease. But, like pain, he thinks it can and should be controlled. “It is a profoundly disabling condition, and it has the side effect that it reduces resilience against treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cancer Research UK has funded Janowitz and his colleagues, as part of a Cancer Grand Challenge, to investigate the causes and treatment of cachexia — and along the way hopefully to raise awareness that it even exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I think it is still underappreciated by oncologists and other doctors that it is a true potential cause of death. And of the people who are aware of it, the majority are too nihilistic about it. They come from this perspective that it’s just the final stage, and it’s a palliative care situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.4"&gt;&lt;div id="eedd15f5-92be-45b4-81e2-69ad2857480f"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic suppress appetite by regulating blood sugar and telling the brain you’re full&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It is actually a condition independent of the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/cancer-patients-missing-treatment-due-to-tumour-testing-delays-9k6xxz6wh" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;tumour&lt;/a&gt;, even though it’s caused by the tumour. If we understand the molecular processes that drive it, we can hope that we can start preventing it from occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Most of us will have actually experienced cachexia ourselves — albeit temporarily. “If you ever had a serious flu, you feel really bad. You don’t enjoy what you normally enjoy, you lose appetite. You curl up in bed, lie in the dark room, until you clear the virus. Then, you recover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There may be good reasons why this happens. Perhaps it evolved to prevent us spreading infectious diseases. Maybe temporary starvation allows us to also starve out viruses or bacteria. But if this is indeed an evolved response to disease, it goes wrong when the disease is cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Now, imagine how you felt at your worst when you have the flu and the underlying cause is not cleared. The cancer is smoldering away. And it continuously drives this adaptive process that in the short term is beneficial. But in the long term, it’s non-sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.10"&gt;&lt;div id="f2a00961-43a8-4a4c-94fa-c7566eaa2ada"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Janowitz says the challenge with chemotherapy is keeping the patient alive, and improving appetite may help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He believes that they have identified ways in which this happens, and so potential ways in which it can be stopped. In particular, there is an immune protein called interleukin-6 that they think is part of a pathway that signals to the brain, driving apathetic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At the very least by interfering with that they may find a way to ease people’s suffering, in the same way as is done routinely with pain medication. Janowitz’s hope is, though, that by doing so we might also &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/increase-in-cancer-survival-rates-has-slowed-worried-experts-warn-2qfx5v6t3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;prolong their survival&lt;/a&gt; or empower them to beat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You know, with chemotherapy I could kill any tumour. The challenge is to not kill the organism — to keep the patient alive.” You can’t do that if a patient is starving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Most cancer therapies make people feel worse.

She explains that the risk of being deficient in this nutrient increases during fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Latitude and season affect both the quantity and quality of sunlight reaching the earth's surface, especially in the UVB region of the spectrum, which is the part responsible for making vitamin D in our skin,” Dr. Chen says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2839537/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a scientific study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a scientific study&lt;/a&gt; showing that human skin exposed to sunlight on cloudless days in Boston from November through February produced &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; previtamin D3. “If you live north of Atlanta in the US or north of Rome in Europe, the likelihood is that your vitamin D levels may drop during fall and winter,” she says, adding that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9573946/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one in four Americans don’t get enough vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one in four Americans don’t get enough vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/vitamin-to-help-you-live-to-100-according-to-longevity-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If You Want to Live to 100, This Is the Vitamin That Will Actually Make a Difference;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;If You Want to Live to 100, This Is the Vitamin That Will Actually Make a Difference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dramarianariveros.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mariana Sofia Riveros, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Mariana Sofia Riveros, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a general physician at &lt;a href="https://shawellness.com/en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SHA Wellness Clinic Mexico;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SHA Wellness Clinic Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, explains that during summer, most people get enough vitamin D because they are outside a lot, and one major source of vitamin D is sun exposure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Think of vitamin D as your ‘reserve tank.’ After summer, many people have decent levels of outdoor activity. But as fall arrives, that tank starts to run low. If you don’t measure it now, by mid-winter you might be running on empty, which can increase fatigue, weaken bones and reduce resilience against infections,” she says. “In my practice, I often see patients with fatigue, low energy or muscle weakness, assuming the cause is hormones, anemia, poor diet or lack of sleep. While those are valid contributors, it is not unusual to find that the missing piece is actually low vitamin D."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in the northern part of the US, are over 65, have a chronic health condition or are breastfeeding, both doctors say you are at a higher risk for being deficient in vitamin D. When this happens, they say it can lead to a whole slew of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/supplements-to-never-take-together" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Never Combine These 2 Supplements Without Checking With Your Doctor First, Experts Warn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Never Combine These 2 Supplements Without Checking With Your Doctor First, Experts Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lack of vitamin D is like taking the foundation out of a house,” D. Riveros says. She explains that the structure (bones and muscles) becomes unstable because low vitamin D weakens bone mineralization, and the “electrical wiring” (immune and hormonal balance) doesn’t function properly because vitamin D receptors are present in immune cells, muscle and the brain. “Over time, this imbalance can lead to chronic fatigue, pain or recurrent illnesses,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen says that other symptoms of not getting enough vitamin D include hair loss, mood changes (such as feeling depressed) and muscle cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are long-term impacts of not getting enough vitamin D too. Dr. Chen says that scientific research has shown that being deficient in vitamin D may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36874594/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase the risk of dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increase the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34815552/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:multiple sclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36579768/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Crohn’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Crohn’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. “A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40409468/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fascinating study just published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fascinating study just published&lt;/a&gt; suggested that vitamin D could even slow aging,” she says, highlighting a scientific study taking into account 25,000 U.S. adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-important-supplement-for-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Want To Improve Your Brain Health?

Experts Agree This Is the Most Important Supplement To Take&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Get Enough Vitamin D in Fall and Winter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, no one wants to feel run-down all winter. Since it can be hard to get enough vitamin D through sun exposure this time of year, both doctors recommend prioritizing other ways to get it, specifically diet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Chen says that good food sources of vitamin D include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement. If so, Dr. Riveros recommends taking one with vitamin D3 and K2 (or taking a vitamin D3 supplement and a K2 supplement). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The addition of K2 supports calcium metabolism, reducing the risk of vascular calcification while protecting bone density,” she says, adding that vitamin K2 can be especially beneficial for women in perimenopause because this is when bone strength and hormone balance become more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen adds that magnesium is another crucial nutrient to prioritize during fall and winter. “Adequate magnesium can help your body utilize vitamin D more effectively. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786912" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Around 50% of American adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Around 50% of American adults&lt;/a&gt; are not getting enough magnesium, so make sure you have enough of it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring you’re getting enough vitamin D now is a great step to ensuring your immunity, energy levels and mood don’t suffer during winter.

			&lt;p&gt;Pieces of bacteria migrating from the gut to the brain may play &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-accelerometer-study-suggests-the-best-sleep-time-for-heart-health"&gt;a key role in sleep&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have discovered, suggesting that the oldest and most basic microorganisms in our bodies are crucial in telling us when to nod off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fragments are made of a chemical called peptidoglycan, which comes from bacterial cell walls in the digestive system. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2016.182"&gt;Previous animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested peptidoglycan can infiltrate the central nervous system and influence behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this latest investigation, neuroscientists Erika English and James Krueger, from Washington State University (WSU), used tests on mice to establish that peptidoglycan levels in the brain change over the course of the day, and are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-key-things-can-help-you-wake-up-feeling-great-scientists-say"&gt;lowest in the morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-state-of-sleep-could-reveal-secrets-of-consciousness"&gt;This Rare State of Sleep Could Reveal Secrets of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;deprived of sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the mix of peptidoglycan in different sections of the brain varied from typical levels. The activity of genes related to the chemical also changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the patterns suggest substances pushed out by our gut bacteria could be influencing sleep, and are influenced by sleep in return. There's still a lot to explore and clarify here, but there's strong evidence of some kind of link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176104" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainLevels.jpg" alt="Peptidoglycan levels" class="wp-image-176104 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainLevels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainLevels-600x335.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176104" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers measured peptidoglycan levels in different areas of mice brains over time.

"Those microbes have a much longer evolutionary history than any mammal, bird, or insect – much longer, billions of years longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think sleep evolution began eons ago with the activity/inactivity cycle of bacteria, and the molecules that were driving that are related to the ones driving cognition today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results contribute to a hypothesis being tested at WSU that posits that our microbiome plays an important role in regulating sleep, along &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-has-a-built-in-weight-loss-system-you-may-not-know-about"&gt;with appetite&lt;/a&gt;, sex drive, and other motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's being called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2025.102145"&gt;the "holobiont condition" of sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the idea that both individual microbes in our body and the master control center of the brain have roles to play in telling us when we need to get some shut-eye and when we need to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not one or the other, it's both," &lt;a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2025/09/24/key-to-the-riddle-of-sleep-may-be-linked-to-bacteria/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; English. "They have to work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep really is a process. It happens at many different speeds for different levels of cellular and tissue organization, and it comes about because of extensive coordination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies are shedding light on how the gut and the brain collaborate to maintain healthy functioning. Microbial mixes are associated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-over-400000-people-links-gut-bacteria-with-insomnia-risk"&gt;with insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, for example, demonstrating the complex interplay between these parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress is also being made in understanding the different and varied factors that govern our urge to sleep and recharge at the right time, including peptidoglycan – from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exposure-to-daylight-predicts-when-youll-fall-asleep-study-shows"&gt;daylight exposure&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-shifted-peoples-day-by-just-5-hours-heres-what-happened"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that the world has come to appreciate how important microbes are, not just for disease but also for health, it's a very exciting time to start to expand on our understanding of how we are communicating with our microbes and how our microbes are communicating with us," &lt;a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2025/09/24/key-to-the-riddle-of-sleep-may-be-linked-to-bacteria/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1608302"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Using a technique known as atomic force microscopy, the scientists passed a tiny needle back and forth over the bacteria to map out their shapes. This let them see how the bacteria changed as the polymyxin attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Y5een5bVfw53pK8sPauUCi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Y5een5bVfw53pK8sPauUCi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymyxins forced &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;to quickly grow tiny bumps and protrusions on its outer membrane, the team found. As these bumps grew, the bacteria shed its armor, leaving gaps in that outer membrane through which antibiotics could enter and kill the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our images of the bacteria directly show how much polymyxins can compromise the bacterial armor," Borrelli said. "It is as if the cell is forced to produce 'bricks' for its outer wall at such a rate that this wall becomes disrupted, allowing the antibiotic to infiltrate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="06e96628-98f1-4985-bdf0-5583aa6d6a72"&gt;Importantly, the polymyxins can only target bacteria that are actively growing, not those that have gone into a dormant state. Bacteria sometimes enter a state of dormancy to deal with difficult conditions, surviving years without eating, growing or reproducing, only to wake back up when conditions are more favorable. While dormant, bacteria can't grow their outer membrane armor, so the antibiotic couldn't ramp up production the same way it could in actively growing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our next challenge is to use these findings to make the antibiotics more effective," Hoogenboom said. "One strategy might be to combine polymyxin treatment — counterintuitively — with treatments that promote armor production and/or wake up 'sleeping' bacteria so these cells can be eliminated too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="9c130326-661e-4df5-8589-2af59cb02b5e"&gt;

But when she got a job at a hospital and was required to check her immunity, the doctor called with shocking news: It appeared she was barely vaccinated as a child, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I just said, ‘Are you kidding me?’” recalled Madison, now 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Madison, who was mostly home-schooled as a child in Montana, is part of a small but growing population of U.S. adults who did not receive routine childhood vaccines - a result of parents skipping or delaying shots for their kids over religious or personal reasons, including concerns about safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As some states work to make it easier for parents to claim exemptions for many childhood vaccines - or seek to eliminate school mandates entirely - Madison’s experience is one that could become more common as today’s schoolchildren age into adulthood. Falling vaccination rates around the country mean more will grow up without protection from debilitating diseases until they are old enough to decide for themselves, typically at age 18. Delaying vaccines can have perilous long-term consequences, and some immunizations are less effective as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interviews with more than a dozen adults who went unvaccinated as children and some of their parents offer a glimpse into the subset of Americans who grew up in vaccine-skeptical households long before the coronavirus pandemic and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. elevated those views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some didn’t know the extent to which they were unprotected until enlisting in the military or health care fields, which often require proof of immunity to join. A few caught vaccine-preventable diseases and are still dealing with the fallout. Others chose not to tell their parents they were getting shots after turning 18 and confided in mentors or other family members as they made their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Immediately after learning about her lack of antibodies from her doctor in 2017, Madison scheduled the next available appointment at the hospital’s clinic. According to medical records shared with The Washington Post, Madison then spent the next year catching up on immunizations for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); chicken pox; and hepatitis B - viruses that have been largely controlled in the U.S. because of widespread immunization. She was nervous about the potential side effects, and braced for impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead, she said, she hardly felt more than a sore arm from receiving so many shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m grateful that science and herd immunity kept me safe while I was unvaccinated,” said Madison, who now lives in Hampton, Virginia. “And I’m happy that I had the ability to amend that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the vast majority of American parents support immunizations, a Washington Post-KFF poll conducted this summer found that 1 in 6 parents have delayed or skipped some vaccines for their children, excluding for the coronavirus or flu. The number of people exercising religious or personal exemptions has risen in 36 states and D.C., with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public health professionals say vaccination rates could decline even further in the coming years, as Kennedy uses his platform to raise concerns - not borne out by scientific research - about the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The U.S. is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in 33 years as well as an elevated number of cases of pertussis - commonly known as whooping cough. Experts largely attribute falling vaccination rates to misinformation, which accelerated during the pandemic, about the safety and effectiveness of certain vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Madison’s parents, Russ and Julie Pierry, the decision to forgo vaccinations for their children in the 1980s was rooted in mistrust of the medical system. In an interview, they said they were disturbed by the battery of shots recommended for their children and didn’t trust their doctor to steer them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Pierrys said Madison, their oldest child, received a few shots when she was born, though they did not know exactly which ones. As Madison grew, they ignored the recommended immunization schedule and boosters and got her a religious exemption for the one year they sent her to a Christian private school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn’t have anything against the shots, political or religious,” Julie Pierry said. “It just seemed like a waste of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long-term consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many ways, medical specialists say, vaccines are a victim of their own success. They have been so effective in controlling diseases like polio and smallpox that many people are unable to imagine how devastating such outbreaks can be for a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for 26-year-old Emma Sonas, a childhood bout with whooping cough was so debilitating that she is still dealing with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sonas, who was delivered in a home birth, said she did not receive a single vaccine growing up. When she was 13, Sonas, along with her mom and siblings, caught whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection that leads to uncontrollable coughing fits as the person gasps for air. Sonas’s symptoms were so severe that she slept upright in her bed for months. Otherwise, she’d wake up and feel like she was drowning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My respiratory system has never been the same,” she said. “The idea that a choice my parents made has resulted into something like this has been really hard to understand and deal with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sonas - who started catching up on her missed childhood vaccines in 2019, according to medical records - said she spent “a lot of time” being angry about her parents’ decision. But she has since realized that they thought they were just doing what was best for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is such a complicated thing to hold, because it was a choice that hurt me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an interview, Sonas’s mother, Christina, said she “sides with nature” and distrusts the companies behind the vaccines. Christina Sonas said she trusts the science behind the vaccines and got the coronavirus vaccine to help protect her immunocompromised family members, including her daughter. When her kids were growing up, she said, it did not feel necessary to vaccinate them because they were home-schooled and she took precautions to isolate them when they were sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But when her children came down with whooping cough, Christina Sonas - who also fell ill - said she felt like she “dropped the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I did feel as a non-vaccinating parent that I needed to be very attentive to my kids’ health,” she said. “It was part of my responsibility to them and to public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The consequences of not receiving a vaccine on the recommended schedule can be severe, leaving people vulnerable to contagious diseases like whooping cough and measles, said James Campbell, a pediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital and School of Medicine. And some vaccines - like the one for HPV, which has the potential to prevent more than 90 percent of cancers caused by the virus, according to the CDC - are more effective when given at a younger age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for parents like Jeremy Newman, the vice president of policy and litigation at the Texas Homeschool Coalition, it’s a risk they are willing to take to have more of a choice in deciding what goes into their child’s body. Newman and his wife vaccinated their first child, who is now 7, but grew uneasy about the shots as they did more research into the potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They immunized their two younger children with only the DTaP vaccine - which includes protection for tetanus - after consulting with a pediatrician who told them the others, like the ones for polio and measles, were unnecessary. Newman said that he is not opposed to vaccines but that the government mandates are “coercive” and have undermined his trust in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The mandates are the thing that makes it so political right now,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;‘Trust is everything’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Several adults spanning different generations said their parents were skeptical of the need to vaccinate against diseases like polio and measles - which were once common but now are relatively rare - because they didn’t personally know anyone affected by them. Some grew up in rural areas where there was spotty access to medical care, or with parents who did not regularly take them to the doctor. Others said their parents believed in debunked conspiracy theories about the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They were like, ‘You’re going to die, you’re going to get autism,’” Jackson Veigel, 38, said of his parents’ aversion to vaccines when he was growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Veigel said his parents filed a religious exemption for his public school in Los Angeles and later moved him to a Christian private school that was “on board with the whole anti-vax thing.” When he started getting his shots in his 20s - including for polio, whooping cough and measles, according to medical records - he said it felt like an act of rebellion toward his parents, whose views he now vehemently disagrees with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was just like, ‘Load me up, Doc,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The tension around vaccines had a shattering impact on some familial relationships. One woman in her 20s, who works for a federal health agency - and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of personal and professional retribution - said her mother grew so skeptical about conventional medicine that she stopped bringing her children in for routine doctors’ visits. Eventually, the woman said, her mother became an anti-vaccine activist herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I know every time I get a vaccine it’s a crack in the relationship with my mom,” said the woman, who is now pursuing a career in public health. “It’s like a betrayal to her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Madison decided to get vaccinated, her parents were supportive of her decision, she said. But when the coronavirus pandemic struck, her parents, Russ and Julie Pierry, were initially apathetic about getting the vaccine as they were quarantining in rural Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like 30 years earlier, they felt like they didn’t have enough information from a person or source they trusted on the shots. But they were persuaded to get the vaccine after their daughter shared information with them about its effectiveness and potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They said their daughter’s persistence has since helped them embrace vaccinations in general. If they had a baby today, Russ Pierry said, “it would be different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today there are “so many distractions that you really gotta pay attention, and not fall for the propaganda,” he said. “Just give us the information and let us make our own decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/01/democrats-shutdown-jeffries-schumer-congress/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Congressional Democrats embrace government shutdown, a risky move;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Congressional Democrats embrace government shutdown, a risky move &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/09/30/fat-bear-week-2025-winner/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fat Bear Week has a new champion.

It struck me as a daft idea that one could make up for drinking too much simply by stopping for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s not how the body works. If you’re worried about your boozing, far better to moderate it in the long term than cutting it out for 31 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem is a lot of people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b7961b20-a1f6-11f0-9397-a1c2d1e7149c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; problems can ‘white knuckle’ it for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They grimly hold on for dear life using sheer willpower, safe in the knowledge that as soon as November starts, they’ll get plastered again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My concern was that by managing to go alcohol-free during Sober October, these people would be convinced they didn’t have a problem, when they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, over the past few years, many of my patients have confided about their Sober October experiences and it has been eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A lot of people with alcohol problems can ‘white knuckle’ it for a month, according to Dr Max Pemberton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a volte-face, I am now a fan. The real benefit isn’t about the physical effects but the mental. It helps you think about your relationship with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can view this month as an experiment to discover what happens, how you cope and what you feel when alcohol is suddenly no longer in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lots of people do not realise – or want to admit to themselves – that they have an issue with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not until you stop for a time that you will see what’s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I recommend everyone try Sober October, but the key is to reflect on how you feel during this time. I urge my patients to ask themselves six questions…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Do you think about alcohol a lot?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’re constantly aware of the absence of alcohol, checking the calendar repeatedly, or finding your thoughts drifting to what you’ll drink once October is over, that’s telling you something pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people without a problematic relationship with alcohol, not drinking for a month is generally no big deal. They might miss a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but they’re not preoccupied by it. If alcohol is taking up a lot of mental space during this month, it suggests it might have a bigger role in your life than you’ve acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Are you counting down the days?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a classic red flag. If you’ve already planned your first drink for the stroke of midnight on November 1, that’s worth examining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who don’t have issues with alcohol are not marking their calendars for when they can start drinking again. They’re not watching the days tick by with anticipation or impatience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Have you stopped going to social events?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding socialising during Sober October is missing the point of the exercise. If you’re finding it difficult to imagine being in a pub or a dinner party minus a drink, that’s significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The question to ask yourself is whether you’re avoiding these situations because you think they’ll be boring without alcohol, or because you’re worried about being the only sober person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Either way, it points to alcohol playing too central a role in how you navigate the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Are you irritable or short-tempered?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mood changes during a period of abstinence can be revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, everyone has off days, but if you’re snappier with your partner, less patient with your children or more on edge, it’s worth considering why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some, alcohol is a way of managing stress or winding down at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’re struggling with irritability, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re an alcoholic, but it does suggest you’re using alcohol as a coping mechanism rather than finding healthier ways to deal with life’s pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Will you bend Sober October rules?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhps you’ve told yourself that one glass doesn’t count, or that it doesn’t mean you have to give up alcohol at that wedding you’re attending mid-month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mental gymnastics some perform to justify having a drink during their ‘alcohol-free’ month can be impressive. But all this negotiating and rule-bending is just your brain trying to convince you that you need alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Feeling good but still yearning for a drink?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-a062db80-a1f8-11f0-9397-a1c2d1e7149c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15164107/Functioning-alcoholic-hide-plain-sight-six-signs-DR-MAX-PEMBERTON.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Dr Max prescribes: Winter vaccine boosters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new covid variants – Nimbus and Stratus – have resulted in infection levels being the highest they have been all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The covid autumn vaccination booster programme launched last week. Care home residents, over-75s and anyone aged over six months who is immunocompromised is eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Remember to get your flu vaccine this year too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the most revealing question of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’re sleeping better, waking up feeling fresher, getting more done, feeling mentally sharper, but still eager to start boozing again, you need to ask yourself why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Logically, if something is making you feel worse, you’d normally want to avoid it. But addiction doesn’t work on logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If all the evidence is pointing to the fact that your life is better without alcohol, but you still can’t wait to reintroduce it, that’s your answer right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The beauty of Sober October is that it holds a mirror up to your relationship with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These questions aren’t designed to make you feel guilty or to diagnose you with alcoholism. They are prompts to help you think honestly about the role drink plays in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don’t like the answers you’re coming up with, well, perhaps that month off doesn’t need to be a one-off after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;It's good to talk about your grief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prince William has &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/royals/article-15148981/Windsor-Prince-William-missing-late-grandparents.html"&gt;opened up about missing Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in Apple TV’s The Reluctant Traveler with actor Eugene Levy.&lt;/a&gt; When asked if he misses his grandmother he replies: ‘I do actually, yeah, I do miss my grandmother, and my grandfather. It’s been quite a bit of change, so you do sort of, you think about them not being here any more, and particularly being in Windsor – for me Windsor is her.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grandparents are incredibly important figures for so many people, yet it’s a bond that we don’t often celebrate. Time and again I’ve seen patients who say their relationship with a grandparent has been vital. They give a perspective on life that only comes from having been there, done that. The skills and resilience they encourage in the younger generation are ones that will equip them for life’s vicissitudes long into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Prince of Wales's grandparents, the late Queen and Prince Philip, died in 2022 and  2021, respectively &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;After the terror attack on a synagogue in Manchester last week, it’s time doctors took the rampant anti-Semitism that has lodged itself in the profession seriously. For example, London-based NHS doctor Dr Rahmeh Aladwan posted: ‘I don’t condemn Hamas. I don’t condemn October 7. I condemn Israel.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;She was allowed to keep her job as a trauma and orthopaedic surgeon after a medical tribunal decided she would remain free to practise while the General Medical Council investigates. Disciplinary proceedings are ongoing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
