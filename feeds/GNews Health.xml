         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3p2u000v25p84zmq7px0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in the ongoing measles outbreak have risen to 258 across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and state health departments are urging more people to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00023b5vqs67xs0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. And what we need to do is give them the best information and encourage them to vaccinate. The vaccine does stop the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000g3b5vav88tonm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy also downplayed the safety of the vaccine and wrongly told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that measles outbreaks could be driven in part by people who have waning immunity from the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00053b5v0v5kz16s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you and I were kids, everybody got measles, and measles gave you … lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people, it wanes,” Kennedy told Hannity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000h3b5vxwevrnfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some years, we have hundreds of these outbreaks. … And, you know, part of that is that there are people who don’t vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes. The vaccine wanes 4.5% per year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000i3b5v3z5d4ls8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says that if that were the case, measles wouldn’t have been declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000j3b5vo28cp0c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s some dispute among experts about how much protection may wane, if at all. However, they all agree that in most cases, the vaccine confers lifelong immunity against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000k3b5vfzpe8mrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000l3b5vcnumhxex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even those who may have waning immunity will not transmit large amounts of virus, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000n3b5vu7qf6jqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of antibodies created by the vaccine might decrease over time, but with a virus like measles, its longer incubation period gives the body’s immune memory cells more time to help fight the infection. This enables long-lasting immunity from vaccination, Offit explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000o3b5v4h6ba485@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 cases reported each year, many of them related to international travel. There have been an average of about eight outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years, at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But even the worst outbreaks typically stay under 50 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86g9olv00023b6mxzc4gjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year with more than 200 cases. The others were 2014, with an outbreak tied to Disneyland, and 2019, when a nearly year-long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;outbreak in New York came&lt;/a&gt; within weeks of ending the nation’s elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00043b5vh4511r14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Kennedy’s statements promoted natural immunity, acquired when someone gets measles, over vaccine induced immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00063b5va3ru8iqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. People who were naturally infected with measles will also have immunity, but not without serious risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00083b5vntjmvb6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of a vaccine is to induce the immunity that is a consequence of natural infection without paying the price of natural infection,” Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00093b5vt0ttubit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The price of infection can be high: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000a3b5v2gwpstk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000b3b5vbwnrlb9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another possible consequence of infection is “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/measles-amnesia-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” When the measles virus infects immune cells, it can erase the body’s memory of how to fight other infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000c3b5v8d7lomlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you want to take the natural immunity route … you’re destroying your previously existing immune memory and putting yourself at risk for every other infection that you could get. And so there is no world in which measles is good for the body, and there’s no world in which getting measles infection is better than getting a measles vaccine,” Mina said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000d3b5vvmg0itxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also inaccurately said vaccine-induced immunity may not be passed through breast milk to nursing infants the way natural immunity is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000e3b5vo9dpuopq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is wrong. Maternal antibody transfer is a key form of neonatal protection against infectious diseases,” said Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. “Even when a mother had vaccination many years ago, antibodies still transfer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f6gni001b3b5vqrw4t065@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is especially important because infants can get protection against the virus through antibodies from their mother in the first six months of life, when they are too young to be vaccinated, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000q3b5vlis2ldbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also incorrectly described adverse events from the MMR vaccine, saying it “causes deaths every year. … It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes: encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86h84sf00053b5vufashffu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, called this “disinformation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86i7fzb000r3b6m5x054zpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The measles vaccine is incredibly safe,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This is what anti-vaccine activists do is, they play up and try to scare you with the very, very rare side effects and forget to tell you about the horrific effects of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86fiw6100003b5vq5g5pbyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles infection can cause encephalitis and blindness, but only a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; of these kinds of illnesses related to vaccination have ever been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000r3b5v67vvpdlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4599698/pdf/nihms724114.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reviewed reports from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, in addition to medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, did not find evidence to suggest “a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000s3b5vettes80u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The MMR vaccine is extremely safe. The most common side effects that people may get is the low-grade fever for a few days, and sometimes people can get this temporary rash It usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Those are by far the most common symptoms, and there are a few more that are much less common, but they are extremely rare,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86gt7ax00023b5vgkyh5pve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More serious side effects from vaccination are extremely rare, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000t3b5vvqkkehye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of those [common side effects] are signs that the vaccine is working and your immune system is mounting the responses it’s supposed to to gain memory to protect you later. But many folks are touting these as significant adverse events, and so I think that the devil is really in the details on this,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3qho00003b5vwl0esfyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

                Scientists who research vaccine hesitancy and uptake are seeing their federal funding cut, under a Trump administration move. It's part of a swathe of cuts to ongoing research funded by NIH.

        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is slashing long-standing areas of research funded by the National Institutes of Health, claiming they no longer align with the agency's priorities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The latest target?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Millions of dollars in NIH grants for studying vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels. It's work that's particularly relevant as a measles outbreak grips the Southwest amidst diminishing vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, scientists around the country have begun receiving letters stating their existing grants — money already awarded to them in a competitive process — were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the cuts appeared to primarily target research on LGBTQ+ health and other areas that were deemed in conflict with President Trump's executive orders on gender and "diversity, equity and inclusion."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, more than 40 grants related to vaccine hesitancy have been cancelled, and there are mounting concerns that research on mRNA vaccines could be on the chopping block next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR obtained information about the changes from two NIH staffers and one person familiar with NIH's activities who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. And, NPR reviewed emails and documents they provided.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I want to underscore just how unprecedented — how abnormal all of this is," one longtime NIH official told NPR. "This is not how we operate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An email circulated among NIH leadership this week included a list of grants that were to be terminated and details on the specific language to use in those notices. "It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment," the email states.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how many grants have been cancelled in total under the Trump administration. Neither the NIH nor its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, replied to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It appears that there are forces intent on destroying our existing vaccine enterprise," says &lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/286/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Temte&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin who studies vaccine hesitancy. "Defunding research on vaccine hesitancy is the latest example of this effort."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;mRNA research may be at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In what some at the agency view as an ominous sign, the NIH's acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli also requested information last week about the funding that supports mRNA vaccine research, technology that underpins the COVID-19 shots from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to an email reviewed by NPR. A similar call for data preceded the termination of the other vaccine grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"NIH staff internally are very worried that the mRNA grants will follow the outcome of the vaccine hesitancy grants and be terminated," according to one of the NIH employees who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. "There are widespread concerns that this will limit the ability to combat pandemics and halt promising lifesaving cancer treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reviewed the NIH list of 130 of these awards issued by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, which funds the most mRNA research. This includes efforts to develop vaccines for a variety of diseases, including Lyme disease, dengue and a sometimes life-threatening gastrointestinal infection known as &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the NIH like the National Cancer Institute also fund this work, because mRNA technology holds promise for targeted cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am on pins and needles constantly," says &lt;a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/microbiology/profiles/richner-justin/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Richner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Illinois, Chicago. "I'm really kind of waiting for the shoe to drop in terms of looking for the email saying the grant has been canceled."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richner's $1 million, 4-year NIH grant is on the agency's internal list. His lab is working to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect against dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an outrageous incursion on the way in which the NIH is managing the money that's been appropriated by Congress," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-varmus" target="_blank"&gt;Harold Varmus&lt;/a&gt;, a Nobel Prize winning professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College who ran the NIH from 1993 to 1999. "The idea that we're going to turn one of the most prestigious aspects of federally supported activities into a graveyard is very troubling to everybody."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/aaron-scherer" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Scherer&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Iowa who studies vaccine hesitancy, says his grants are not canceled as far as he knows, but given what's happening, he assumes that NIH will not be funding his future proposal "regardless of its scientific and health merits."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health disparities and LGBTQ+ research loses ground&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine research is just the latest target in the Trump administration's expanding effort to cut off NIH-funded researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A first wave of letters went out last month to researchers notifying them their grants were being canceled because they did not fit with President Trump's executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Letters of termination reviewed by NPR state "no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities," but a current NIH employee told NPR that the scientific staff at their institute who would be responsible for making that determination are not being consulted. "They're not checking with us," said the person, adding that these termination decisions are coming with virtually no notice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to an internal memo, NIH staff were directed to separate awards into different categories depending, for example, on whether the "sole purpose of the project is DEI related" or could still be viable if modified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidance also has implications for hundreds of awards in the coming months, because many "Notices of Funding Opportunities" have been taken down, and grants that applied through those notices will not get their funding, either, the NIH staffer told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brittany-charlton/" target="_blank"&gt;Brittany Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard University, says she's tallied two dozen awards that have been terminated among her colleagues for work that touches on issues like HIV prevention and Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cuts are not only affecting research on the LGBTQ+ population but also other vulnerable communities, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not studying fringe issues, and they're not at all ideological either,"  Charlton says, "The research that's being abruptly terminated by the federal government right now is really meant to identify what underlies some of these disparities and help to address them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The good and the bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html"&gt;For reference&lt;/a&gt;, the optimal LDL level for adults is less than 100 mg/dL, and optimal HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher. Higher LDL levels can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and other health problems, while higher HDL has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. Though some of the changes reported in the study were small, the researchers note that they could be meaningful in some cases. For instance, an increase of 5 mg/dL in LDL is enough to raise the risk of a cardiovascular event by 2 percent to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three different models to adjust for a variety of factors, including basics like age, sex, body mass index, as well as medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as exercise, dietary habits, and smoking. All the models showed the same associations. They also broke out the data by what kinds of alcohol people reported drinking—wine, beer, sake, other liquors and spirits. The results were the same across the categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study isn't the first to find good news for drinkers' cholesterol levels, though it's one of the larger studies with longer follow-up time. And it's long been found that alcohol drinking seems to have some benefits for cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;A recent review and meta-analysis by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate drinkers had lower relative risks of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis also found that drinkers had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (death by any cause). The study did, however, find increased risks of breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.stopalcoholabuse.gov/media/pdf/Report-on-Alcohol-Intake-and-Health.pdf"&gt;Another recent review&lt;/a&gt; found increased risk of colorectal, female breast, liver, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the new cholesterol findings aren't an invitation for nondrinkers to start drinking or for heavy drinkers to keep hitting the bottle hard, the researchers caution. There are a lot of other risks to consider. For drinkers who aren't interested in quitting, the researchers recommend taking it easy. And those who do want to quit should keep a careful eye on their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their words: "Public health recommendations should continue to emphasize moderation in alcohol consumption, but cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored after alcohol cessation to mitigate potential [cardiovascular disease] risks," the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published last year, are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world. Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a dietary fiber in the class fructan. Another is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), and it is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg" alt="Aerial view of a cup of tea next to sachets of sweetener" class="size-full wp-image-144930" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fructooligosaccharide is often used as a natural low calorie sweetener. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFb-9YB388/"&gt;towfiqu barbhuiya/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg" alt="Illustration of bacteria in the gut" class="size-full wp-image-144933" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins.

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXEf1Xfh1bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's College is home to the United Kingdom's largest adult twin registry, and twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/2/81/5237462?login=false#127953545"&gt;Past studies on rodents&lt;/a&gt; suggest that high-fiber supplements, like inulin and FOS, can 'feed' the colon's microbiome, allowing 'good' bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these bacterial players are &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;also linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved cognitive function in both mice and &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200488"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg" alt="Twin sisters smiling with arms around each other" class="size-full wp-image-144937" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.

Some experts are now so convinced by the results, they &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/gut-brain"&gt;refer to the gut&lt;/a&gt; as the body's 'second brain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way these two nervous systems work together remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent twin study at KCL suggests that consuming certain 'brain foods' may be a promising way to treat cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while prebiotics might improve some aspects of cognitive function in an aging brain, like memory and processing times, there don't appear to be significant physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss didn't improve among aging twins taking high-fiber supplements, despite the fact that inulin and FOS are important factors in musculoskeletal maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These plant fibers, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; geriatrician Claire Steves at KCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Senior couple completing a jigsaw" class="size-full wp-image-144939" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain.

&lt;p&gt;That said, females are more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, and studies like the current one support the emerging idea that cognitive decline is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-reveals"&gt;not always a disease of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but may involve external factors, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut has its fingers in many bodily 'pies', including the immune system and the central nervous system. Feeding its microbiome certain &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410452/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could open the door to treating a plethora of illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The CDC reports that there have been a total of 70 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans across 13 states (including one death), but the agency rates the current public health risk as low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, outbreaks of avian flu have slowed over the past two weeks, and wholesale egg prices are dropping, according to the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;March 7 report. &lt;/a&gt;For now, though, the average &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/california-restaurants-egg-shortage-20014211.php" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;price of eggs&lt;/a&gt; remains high in California: $10.35 per dozen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,” read the USDA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, the USDA predicted egg prices would &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/egg-price-increase-bird-flu-usda-20189782.php" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;rise 41%&lt;/a&gt; this year.

              &lt;p&gt;The surging measles outbreak, which has already sickened hundreds and hospitalized dozens in Texas and New Mexico, will get worse before it gets better. In a recent alert sent to health care providers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that it expects the deadly virus to continue to spread rapidly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s warning was provided in a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; late last week. As of Tuesday, Texas health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; 223 measles cases in the state, with 29 hospitalized and one dead as a result. Measles has also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in other states this year, including New Mexico, New York, Alaska, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak has been ongoing since mid-January. It’s largely affected people living in Mennonite communities in rural western Texas, many of whom are unvaccinated. In late February, an unvaccinated “school-aged” child in Texas died from the preventable viral disease—the first such U.S. death &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in a decade. The outbreak has also spread to neighboring regions of New Mexico, with 33 reported cases so far. In early March, New Mexico health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-measles-outbreak-tops-200-cases-as-second-death-investigated-2000573252"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a recently deceased resident tested positive for measles, though an investigation into this person’s official cause of death is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, it can quickly spread through communities with relatively low vaccination rates. Roughly 94% of a population has to be vaccinated against measles to prevent widespread transmission, a concept known as herd immunity. Very early on into the outbreak, local health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; that hundreds had already been infected, and that tally has likely gotten bigger since. Even a month ago, the outbreak was the largest seen in the state in nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago, though outbreaks have occasionally appeared in pockets of the country where vaccination rates are low (these outbreaks will usually start when an infected person travels back from a region where the disease is endemic). While the risk for widespread measles in the United States remains low, thanks to high vaccination rates nationwide, the CDC does expect the immediate situation in Texas and New Mexico to worsen. In its advisory, the CDC says the outbreak is continuing “to expand rapidly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This year, there have been measles cases reported in 13 states. On Tuesday, Oklahoma health officials &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; two cases in the state that appear to be connected to the Texas and New Mexico clusters. The cases seen elsewhere appear to be travel-related, though it is possible that further outbreaks could emerge from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, 2025’s total reported tally is well on pace to overtake the 285 measles cases reported nationwide last year. It remains to be seen whether this year will be worse than 2019, which featured widespread and sustained outbreaks in parts of New York that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-u-s-is-officially-free-of-measles-for-now-1838776475"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to strip away the country’s official status of having eliminated measles on a local level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest outbreaks have occurred under the watch of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the new head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Though Kennedy has expressed some support for measles vaccination since taking over the HHS, he has a long track record of spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. He has also recently touted &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;scientifically unsupported treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, such as cod liver oil supplements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For its part, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;clearly states&lt;/a&gt; that the MMR vaccine “remains the most important tool for preventing measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of research into Helmholtz resonance in general, but according to Yicong Fu of Cornell University and co-authors, there has not been any significant attempt to cross-confirm that human hand claps serve as Helmholtz resonators. So they recruited 10 participants to clap into a microphone 20–30 times each for three different hand configurations: cupped, palm to palm, and palm to finger. They used baby powder to map the air flow produced by the clapping, along with measuring pressure and capturing the action on high-speed video. They also made soft polymer hand replicas designed to mimic the elasticity of human skin and used them to generate clapping sounds for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The recorded frequencies matched the predictions of the Helmholtz resonator model, confirming that hand claps function like a resonator, rather than being a solid collision sound. Frequency depended upon hand configuration: clapping with cupped hands, for instance, produced lower frequencies than clapping with palm to finger because the cupped configuration created a larger resonant cavity. Clapping faster produces a louder initial sound, while lower skin elasticity produces a longer-lasting sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, "Our work provided the first experimental support for the theoretical framework and improved the fundamental understanding of hand claps for broader application potentials," the authors concluded. Specifically, "These findings may facilitate low-cost acoustical diagnostics in architecture and enhance rhythmic sound patterns in music and language education." It might even be possible one day to identify someone based on their distinctive claps and use it as a kind of acoustic login for electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not seen again until these sequences were uploaded late Tuesday. The data was uploaded by the USDA’s National Veterinary Laboratory Services to a public access genetic repository known as &lt;a class="link" href="https://gisaid.org/" target="_blank"&gt;GISAID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Niman, an evolutionary molecular biologist with Recombinomics Inc., a virus and vaccine research company in Pittsburgh, reviewed the sequence data and reported the results to The Times and on social media Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08254-7" target="_blank"&gt;Kawaoka exposed ferrets&lt;/a&gt; in his laboratory to that viral strain. He found the ferrets were able to transmit the virus to one another via respiratory droplets, and it killed 100% of the infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas dairy worker complained only of conjunctivitis; he didn’t have a fever or show signs of respiratory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data provided to GISAID don’t include location data, so scientists often use other information to identify the herds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, because the sequence data was added Tuesday, it is likely from herds that were only recently reported by the USDA. In the last week, herds from Idaho and California have been added to the USDA’s tally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The herds in California have the more common B3.13 strain, which has been associated with dairy cows since last year. The strain circulating in Idaho is D1.1, which spilled over from wild birds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the new sequence data added on Tuesday — which were of the B3.13 variety — are likely from infected California herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak was first reported in dairy cows last March, 70 people have been infected and one person has died. According to the USDA, 985 dairy herds have been infected, with 754 of those located in California. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:42:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOYk1WMUhTS3E1cVhuZkZDYjlmR1hBOTRTc3hsOXp5cjg4cHlRRjY4MThIVUJVbXk3Q3BQekRrSTJQUkJHamtVbTZqaG5zUXdISnNuRVRTTWQtcEFLbEotWDJtakNjY29QeW1XQ2RHZDFiSkg4cVVoUk0xbzB2NXpPekxxNVBLQmdNZWhTNGRDRkhqSDhudDVzZzZUZU55WkduV3NyZXZYVGdaMkl6SUE</guid></item><item><title>Uh … Am I Protected Against Measles?

Both were unvaccinated, and one was an otherwise healthy 6-year-old. You know that the child’s Mennonite community in West Texas continues to get hit hard, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 cases as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. And you know that there’s another cluster of cases in New Mexico—where the second death occurred—&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/measles-outbreak-grows-hantavirus"&gt;that’s genetically linked&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001v3b725zue3u84@published"&gt;Given all that, you might also be wondering if you need to do anything to protect yourself and your loved ones: Am I vaccinated &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;? Do I need a measles booster? Should I confirm that I’m immune by taking something called a &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/antibody-titer"&gt;titer test&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001w3b725nnsbnd0@published"&gt;“It’s the question du jour,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001x3b72d667lnez@published"&gt;It makes sense to worry: “Measles is not a trivial disease,” Schaffner reminds me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/01/measles-outbreak-at-disney-anti-mmr-vaccine-activists-claim-disease-isnt-dangerous.html"&gt;Quite the opposite&lt;/a&gt;: Although measles, the most contagious virus on record, doesn’t have a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; high mortality rate (1 to 3 in every 1,000 infected people will die), it sends &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/measles/"&gt;20 percent of unvaccinated people to the hospital&lt;/a&gt;—and that number is higher for children under 5—with serious complications ranging from pneumonia to brain swelling. Basically, you are right to not be reassured by that mortality rate. “We shouldn’t only be talking about death,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to avoid infection at all costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001y3b723xayt500@published"&gt;The good news is that we have an effective and safe vaccine that does exactly that: For most people, it &lt;em&gt;completely prevents&lt;/em&gt; infection (unlike, say, the flu vaccine, which may solely &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;ease symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, not prevent you from getting the flu entirely). Thanks to the measles vaccine, usually called the MMR vaccine, in combination with mumps and rubella, the U.S. declared measles to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;be effectively eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The reason it’s coming back is that people are unvaccinated. To reach herd immunity—enough of a population being immune that measles can no longer spread—about 95 percent of people need to be vaccinated. In the Texas community where the child died during the outbreak, the measles vaccination rate among kindergartners is 82 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd001z3b72hx360qro@published"&gt;If you are healthy, got two doses of MMR, and were born after 1989: you’re good. “The recommendation is, sit pretty,” says Steier. Two doses of MMR &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster#:~:text=No%20vaccine%20is%20100%25%20effective,97%25%20effective%20against%20rubella.)"&gt;provides lifetime protection&lt;/a&gt; for about 97 percent of people. (The other 3 percent may still get measles but will likely have milder symptoms and be less able to spread the virus than they would otherwise.) So if you were vaccinated after 1989, there’s absolutely no need to get a booster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00203b728nno2vvh@published"&gt;If you were born before 1957, you also don’t need to worry about vaccination. You were born at a time when measles still ran rampant, so you almost certainly had the virus as a kid and are now immune. It’s not the ideal way to get immunity, but congratulations! You have it.&lt;/p&gt;

People born between 1957 and 1967 were getting vaccinated, but some received a version of the vaccine that was less effective than the one we use today. And many born between 1967 and 1989 got only one dose of MMR, which was the recommendation at the time but means they’re less likely to be &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; protected. If you received the less effective vaccine or got just one shot, it’s a good idea to get a booster vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps you can’t find your vaccination records, you were born &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; 1989, or you have no idea which version of the vaccine you got. If you really don’t know, the answer is simple. “Go into your health care provider, roll up your sleeve, and ask for a dose of MMR,” says Schaffner. (An exception is if you’re pregnant, in which case it’s recommended that you &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/28/can-you-get-the-measles-vaccine-while-pregnant/"&gt;wait to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt;.) Even if you don’t need another MMR dose, it won’t hurt to get the extra one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00233b72ftc7l9yo@published"&gt;Another key exception here is for people who &lt;a href="https://time.com/7266454/measles-outbreak-essay-ashish-jha/"&gt;are severely immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, such as cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. MMR is a live vaccine, and the worry is that it could replicate and cause illness if a recipient’s immune system is too weak. It’s also worth noting that people who were vaccinated before becoming immunocompromised may face reduced immunity. This population relies on herd immunity to stay safe from measles. That is why getting vaccinated is more than a &lt;a href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/content/wellness/vaccines-personal-choice-or-moral-responsibility"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, worrying about our own personal health is one of the limited things we can do right now when it comes to the scary spread of measles: “While we can’t fully control our environment, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control our own immunization status,” writes infectious disease epidemiologist Nina Masters in her newsletter &lt;a href="https://knowyourvax.com/2025/02/21/measles-coming-to-a-city-near-you/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Know Your Vax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;a common service&lt;/a&gt;, but in most cases, &lt;a href="https://www.southshorehealth.org/wellness/blog/do-adults-need-measles-titer-check"&gt;some experts argue&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re that unsure of your status for measles, you should just get a booster. Checking titers requires an extra doctor’s visit and extra expense, so it’s a hassle. Plus, titers don’t provide a complete picture of your immunity, says Steier. Even if your antibody levels come back low, you have what are called memory B cells, which could be helping to protect you—and because they don’t make much antibody, they won’t really show up on that test. If you feel as if you have to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, skip the titers and get the booster.&lt;/p&gt;

The next time you’re at the doctor, though, ask them to review your vaccination history. It’s always a good idea to make sure you’re fully &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings may help to explain the connection between MS and EBV, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adl3604"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Altered immune landscape of cervical lymph nodes reveals Epstein-Barr virus signature in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for causing infectious mononucleosis, colloquially known as mono. EBV can also infect people and cause nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms at all, so while most adults have been infected with the virus, the majority does not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;EBV infection key risk factor for MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A building body of evidence has suggested EBV infection is a key &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factor for MS&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, some data suggest MS can only develop in people who have a history of EBV infection. However, it remains unclear exactly how EBV may set the stage for MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the interaction between EBV and MS, researchers conducted detailed analyses of immune cells extracted from lymph notes in the neck. The analysis included lymph nodes from seven people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/newly-diagnosed-guide-for-ms/"&gt;newly diagnosed MS&lt;/a&gt; and six people who did not have MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymph nodes are immune organs — if immune cells are the body’s soldiers, the lymph nodes are like barracks where immune cells live and train to do battle. The researchers specifically focused on lymph nodes of the neck because part of the immune response against EBV seems to occur in that location, so they’re most likely to play roles in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found MS patients showed marked abnormalities in their B-cells, the immune cells that make antibodies, which have been heavily implicated in the development of MS. Specifically, MS patients had more memory B-cells, which are B-cells that are produced after infection to help the body fight off the same infection if it occurs again. At the same time, patients had fewer germinal center B-cells, which are basically B-cells that are actively involved in fighting infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate a significant disturbance in B cell maturation in [neck lymph nodes] of [people with] MS compared with those of healthy controls,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, EBV is able to infect B-cells and alter their activity. This has been hypothesized to be one of the main mechanisms that might link EBV and MS. Supporting that idea, the abnormal memory B-cells in MS patients showed changes in genetic activity that are similar to what’s seen when EBV infects these cells. The researchers also found more DNA from the Epstein-Barr virus in lymph nodes from people with MS than in those without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Paralleled with the detection of an EBV signature and the known influence of EBV [on B-cell activity], our findings support B cell dysregulation as a central mechanism in MS pathogenesis [disease development],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Abnormalities found in B-cells, CD8 T-cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to changes in B-cells, the researchers also noted abnormalities in CD8 T-cells from some of the MS patients. CD8 T-cells are considered the assassins of the immune system, able to kill other cells that show signs of viral infection. Each CD8 T-cell is equipped with a specialized receptor that it uses to attack one specific target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a few of the MS patients had increased levels of CD8 T-cells targeting EBV. The highest numbers of anti-EBV CD8 T-cells were detected in a patient who had their lymph node sample collected during a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;disease relapse&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; flare up due to increased inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of blood samples showed EBV-targeting CD8 T-cells were also present in the blood of patients who had these cells in their lymph nodes, implying that the EBV-attacking CD8 T-cells can move out of the lymph nodes to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these data suggest EBV may lead to dysregulation of B-cells and CD8 T-cells in MS patients, which may set the stage for MS-driving inflammation. Based on the available data, the researchers think that B-cells dysregulated by EBV may trigger a surge in activity of anti-EBV CD8 T-cells, which can move to the brain to trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that EBV-reactivated B cells expand in [lymph nodes] before a relapse, triggering an expansion of EBV-targeting memory CD8 T cells and their subsequent migration to the [brain and spinal cord], leading to a relapse,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stressed, however, that this hypothesis was based on observations from a few patients, so more work is needed to validate this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the highest number of recent Long Island measles cases was in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

More than half of the participant pool identified as Black or African American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants received points based on which components of Life’s Simple 7 they met, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were then divided into three groups based on their cardiovascular health (CVH) score: 0-6 points, 7-9 points, and 10-14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Higher CVH scores linked to lower NfL biomarker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, researchers found that participants with the highest CVH scores had significantly lower serum levels of a neurodegeneration biomarker called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10380627/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurofilament light chain (NfL);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurofilament light chain (NfL)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, those with high CVH scores experienced slower annual increase in NfL levels as participants aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NfL is a protein found in nerve cells that helps keep them strong and healthy,” Dhana explained. “When these cells are damaged, NfL is released into the blood and spinal fluid, making it a useful marker of brain health. We used NfL in our study because higher levels may indicate nerve cell damage, helping us understand the potential link between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results highlight the importance of maintaining good CVH through managing risk factors, as it may help reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for increased heart disease education in the Black community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhana and her team also observed that participants with the highest CVH scores were predominantly White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this suggests that promoting cardiovascular health education in older adults, especially in the Black community, may help lighten the burden of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research shows that Black individuals have an increased risk for both &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6200348/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543531/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurodegenerative diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving cardiovascular health in older adults may help reduce the impact of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Black adults, who experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease.

I think this study is pretty interesting in the sense that it gives a potential mechanism by which that may happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see a prospective study that would look at a high risk population and see if improving CVH scores lowered biomarkers and decreased risk of developing neurodegeneration,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reducing-7-risk-factors-heart-disease-may-help-lower-alzheimers-biomarkers-neurodegenerative/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:21:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5fVDh1Z1h1cGFnd0VvbXB5em40MGZFV0RWaUU3QjdKWG05RDBMNFlqWW1rbEVpeW56ZTUxUEdMbDM2d2V6cmRXTjhxbzJlaVNzZjZXb21XNFBLdC1FYVpaTlRTcmJHX1V0elg1VVZGWmVaZw</guid></item><item><title>What to Know About Measles Cases in New York and New Jersey - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9MSWJ5VVZlQXJLUFh1TG81RmhsOXJueG04T2hsSVc0MHlpd2dyVUZ0MmJFcUxKRVJOeWJpTWEyNDZkYVRYSTkxamFEby1JQ0pVZEVDbERCMFNwa3BpNEozSjRLWGV1UlZyR1ZPQ0RNSnZjZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts are emphasizing the importance of vaccination against measles after three people in New York and three in New Jersey were diagnosed with the viral illness since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s not unusual for sporadic cases of measles to be reported. Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned.

The first case was reported in January, the second in February and the third in mid-March. The first two patients have recovered and the third, an unvaccinated child under 5 years old from Suffolk County, was being treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens, the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;state’s Department of Health said&lt;/a&gt; on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s Health Department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

under the age of eight should avoid consuming slushy ice &lt;a href="/topic/drinks"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; containing the sweetening agent glycerol, researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of youngsters have become unwell as a result of so-called “glycerol intoxication syndrome”, which caused &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like decreased consciousness and low blood sugar, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slush drinks maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, slush drinks – also known as slushies – containing the ingredient are not recommended for &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; under the age of four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, academics have called for the public health advice to be revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the review, published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, researchers at &lt;a href="/topic/university-college-dublin"&gt;University College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; looked at the medical notes of 21 &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and Ireland who fell ill after consuming a slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngsters were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also recommends consumption is limited to no more than one slush per day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” academics said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQOE1tUjdaVU9ncnJOenBwYkRLVmQySW1WbmlrSEUyalJUZTRtbTVkZV9YVEQ4T2tVWmJzVmZJNmxXUFI1bjhUNGFNcE1laXlFMVlEOGNBX1puT1l3cVFIdnJHUHRBeEtUTUxwbEVTSjFQSFJqWmg2TmZEa3pPVXBJYktBSlpGa3g4SXViYUxrMklFSFFhblRUV0Y0RHJ5N0VNRVVuejVWNmFUaDEzUmNFSzNkY0lpYlZPWTVydThoLVJwYTlUOWtjUg</guid></item><item><title>How Might This Cheap Painkiller Be Able To Stop Some Cancers From Spreading? - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQmdwa3ZSRThrOHpvYU9oX2hDRkZ3X1luYm16NngtemVtYnVaNEpNWFU3alhpNEFIell3bFJ5Mkx6UTFYV0xwOUVnSXFlMnZDekRCZmNfdkhmQlRvUzhmTDFYeWNadkhvWUU5REZVSEhDOVR5VktYTGlHWXBYU1RWVVplWGl5TkFpd1JPZGxfcVNoODhlZXNxaGQwdWl3RUlLRGRCcTFGNi1GcHlo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge believe they have uncovered the mechanism behind how aspirin, a common and inexpensive painkiller, might be able to stop cancer from spreading – and they made this discovery somewhat by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they’d been looking at was how the immune system responds to metastasis. This is when single cancer cells break away from the initial tumor and spread elsewhere in the body, and it’s the primary cause of death for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0134-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the loneliness of these rogue cells also makes them a prime target for T-cells. These are the front-line soldiers of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-cancer-discovery-releases-brakes-on-immune-system-to-treat-stubborn-tumors-76650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, designed to attack and destroy infected and cancerous cells, which is much easier when those cells are on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team was screening mice for immune system-related genes that might be involved in metastasis, they came across something interesting that involved T-cells – a gene that was suppressing their activity, known as &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt;. When they studied mice that didn’t have &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt; in their T-cells, those mice experienced less metastasis from the original tumor to the lungs and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t the root cause of the T-cell problem – there was something else controlling it, and that’s where the team uncovered a surprising link to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/plants-deal-with-stress-by-making-their-own-aspirin-64485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that the T-cell suppressing gene was being switched on by a protein produced by platelets, fragments of cells that help blood to clot. However, clotting can sometimes be a problem; aspirin reduces the amount of the clotting protein, called thromboxane A2 (TXA2), produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60209-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; had suggested that taking a low dose of aspirin on a daily basis could also help to prevent metastasis – what this team had just figured out was how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a Eureka moment when we found TXA2 was the molecular signal that activates this suppressive effect on T cells. Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin. It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of enquiry than we had anticipated,” first author Dr Jie Yang said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-discover-how-aspirin-could-prevent-some-cancers-from-spreading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were tested on two groups of mice with a type of cancer called melanoma: one group was given aspirin, while the other was not (known as a control group). The results showed that, compared to the control group, metastasis was less frequent in the mice that were given aspirin, and that this involved T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that everyone with cancer should run to the drugstore and stock up on aspirin. Not only is further research needed – carried out in humans, seeing as we’re not quite the same as mice – but regular aspirin use can also have &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/low-dose-aspirin/side-effects-of-low-dose-aspirin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including stomach ulcers and bleeding more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the results are promising. If aspirin proves to be a viable treatment, its low cost would make it an attractive one, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies, and therefore more accessible globally,” Yang added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08626-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:21:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQmdwa3ZSRThrOHpvYU9oX2hDRkZ3X1luYm16NngtemVtYnVaNEpNWFU3alhpNEFIell3bFJ5Mkx6UTFYV0xwOUVnSXFlMnZDekRCZmNfdkhmQlRvUzhmTDFYeWNadkhvWUU5REZVSEhDOVR5VktYTGlHWXBYU1RWVVplWGl5TkFpd1JPZGxfcVNoODhlZXNxaGQwdWl3RUlLRGRCcTFGNi1GcHlo</guid></item><item><title>Phase 1 trial of cell therapy seeks more Parkinson’s patients - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQUWZaOG1JUm1xTHhVeUxZdlNmNnZMZjN1dU9Xcm1PN1pMTjFYOFU1T0lHcXViLV9mTDZlTTBkQlFCU1g0VVcwVDMzeXc3TGhHVDJYRmFEZU8yNTVBdC1xTVRFR0RiVHhXaVEwN29RQW8tWXRDQWlyMkVodVZHM0RkaExyeUtaWkRmTVF1M2lacjNqU0owYmw1LWJHTFdmV05qc01fZjZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small Phase 1 clinical trial testing a treatment approach that uses stem cells derived from a patient’s blood cells to replace the dopamine-producing neurons progressively lost in &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is looking for three more patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06422208"&gt;Phase 1 study (NCT06422208)&lt;/a&gt;, being conducted at Harvard Medical School’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has already enrolled and treated three of the six Parkinson’s patients it seeks to include. Eligible participants, ages 55 to 80, must have a &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis of Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for at least five years and show a response to dopaminergic medications, which are those that increase or mimic dopamine, a major brain signaling molecule involved in motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seeing this transformational new patient cell-based replacement of their own [dopamine-producing] neurons come to fruition — from the very basic science breakthroughs in our lab to be completely translated into a clinical application for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease — is very gratifying,” Ole Isacson, a professor at Mass General Brigham and the researcher at McLean Hospital’s Neuroregeneration Research Institute (NRI) who led the preclinical research that laid the trial’s foundation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/clinical-trial-novel-stem-cell-treatment-for-parkinsons"&gt;Mass General Brigham press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe this approach may open up a new treatment paradigm and lead to the development of many additional cell therapies to restore damaged brain systems and replace degenerated brain cells in other diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isacson isn’t involved in this trial, but is the innovator patent holder of the cell therapy technology and a cofounder of Oryon Cell Therapies, which has the license to the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of Parkinson’s is the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. Deficient levels of dopamine disrupt nerve signaling in the brain and lead to the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that mark the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells, which can give rise to all types of cells when exposed to the right molecular cues, could be used to restore the pool of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s. Once in the brain, stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons would provide a new source of dopamine, easing motor symptoms and slowing the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;A patient-derived cell therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isacson led pioneering work at NRI that showed stem cells &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.022438099"&gt;can turn into working dopaminergic neurons&lt;/a&gt; when transplanted into an affected brain region of a rat model of Parkinson’s and that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010209107"&gt;patient-derived stem cells&lt;/a&gt; can be used for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient-derived approach is based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a type of stem cell generated from fully mature cells, like skin or blood cells, that are programmed back to a stem cell-like state, where they can give rise to almost every type of human cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing Phase 1 trial, blood cells from each participant are collected and reprogrammed into iPSCs. They are then grown in the lab in the presence of specific molecular cues that promote their maturation into dopaminergic neurons. The specialized neurons, which can be frozen until use, are then injected during a single surgical session into one side of the putamen, a region of the brain that controls movement and is affected in Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the patient’s own cells — called an autologous approach — avoids needing immunosuppressive medications to thwart immune reactions against transplanted cells from donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial’s main goal is to check how safe this approach is by recording adverse events at 12 and 18 months after the surgery. Secondary goals include assessing score changes in the MDS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale- Parts II and III, which measure the severity of motor symptoms and their impact on daily living, over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will also measure changes in clinical measures of dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements) and cognitive function, along with on time without troublesome dyskinesia and off time, based on diary entries. On time refers to periods when motor symptoms are controlled, while off periods are when motor symptom worsen due to the effects of medication wearing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If results are positive, the researchers hope to launch a Phase 2a trial to test the therapy in a larger number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is extraordinary to witness that investigators at our institution can bring new treatments to patients through the entire process of laboratory ‘bench to bedside,’ and it inspires many investigators to similarly pursue their scientific and medical insights to reach patients in need,” said Kerry Ressler MD, PhD, the chief scientific officer at McLean Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott said the child who was infected was less than a year old and not eligible to get the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials believe the child got it while traveling but the source of the infection is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The child was discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home, according to county health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;This is the third case of measles in the state this year and the first outside of New York City. State health officials said there is no connection between this case and other outbreaks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Pigott said Suffolk County's high vaccination rate against measles makes it unlikely the virus will spread to others in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to data from the state health department, 82.6% of Suffolk County children have received at least one MMR shot by 2 years of age as of Jan. 1, 2025. That number is slightly higher than the overall state average of 81.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials are working to contact trace for any additional potential exposures to people who visited the pediatric emergency department at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park from March 3 to March 4 or visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3 to March 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Cohen Children's Medical Center is contacting patients who visited these areas at the time of potential exposure and has identified patients who are at high risk and may require timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A spokesperson for Cohen Children's Hospital said in a statement to News 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="left"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"A pediatric patient was diagnosed with measles and treated at Cohen Children's Medical Center. We are actively working with public health officials under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident. The situation underscores the critical importance of vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, and the need for them to help prevent diseases like measles and minimize the risk of spreading these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Suffolk County Department of Health has confirmed the child with measles did not attend daycare or school while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by coughing or sneezing into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Individuals can catch the virus by breathing it in, or by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Complications may include pneumonia, encephalitis, miscarriage, preterm birth, hospitalization and death.

	The incubation period for measles is up to 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People who are exposed to measles and have not been previously vaccinated should quarantine for 21 days after exposure. People who were exposed but who have been vaccinated with MMR do not need to quarantine but should self-monitor for 21 days and stay home if they develop symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People diagnosed with measles should isolate until four days after the rash appears.

	Symptoms can include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash of red, flat spots appears on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.

	A person with measles can pass it to others as soon as four days before a rash appears and as late as four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Typically, the first dose of the MMR vaccine is given to kids between 12 to 15 months old and the second dose is given between four and six years old as the child heads to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the CDC, one MMR vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles and two doses are about 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdnNUZEFHMmNKRUJWOFkwOEs0cFpVV1RPWVdfZ2EydFRxbkVoYS1wUkNIamFDa05rOGhLUHotSl9PcERlSUhnSzNXOFFYQktiUGozUFJvLXh0bHMwR3MwUHFKX05PZExsR0hiRFN1dHRacVR3OTZEeDVIeDJyc0cxR2ZZWmNWdklEYWJGd1h0a2U5bl9JQ2tSUjR5WV8xd3VOX0NN</guid></item><item><title>My body exploded with sores after breakthrough measles infection... why even the vaccinated should be worried - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who caught measles and suffered its brutal symptoms despite being vaccinated has issued a warning over the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood MMR vaccine is 97 percent effective at stopping transmission, but measles is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14087169/cdc-warns-trump-measles-vaccine-decline-rfjk-jr-health.html"&gt; so infectious&lt;/a&gt; it can still cause breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, a teacher from Ontario, was exposed when one of her unvaccinated students came to school with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The child fell sick and after diagnosis, health officials told Marcy and her class to isolate for up to 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said she had been doubled-vaccinated as a child and received a booster after she was exposed, but over the next six days, she developed a fever that continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the charac&lt;span&gt;teristic rash came. It erupted all over her face, and spread down her neck to her back, arms and legs — covering them in bright red spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a booster, and I still developed the infection — in fact I started to get a fever six days after my booster,' Marcy said on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy, pictured above, developed the measles after being exposed to an infected unvaccinated child in the school where she worked in Ontario, Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I got a mild fever at first, and then it got worse and worse, instead of getting better, which should have been the first clue.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in Texas, where more than 250 people have been infected while at least 29 have been hospitalized and two are reported to have died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the patients, just five (or 2 percent) were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an outbreak in Ontario that has sickened at least 177 people, mostly children at the state's schools. Marcy is a patient in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these patients, just eight were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine prevents infections in the vast majority of cases, but the CDC says online that about three in 100 people who receive the vaccine could still be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients tend to suffer a more mild infection, however, and avoid the worst effects of measles including encephalitis, or brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, who revealed her case on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcyteaches/video/7472085787752893751"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said that she had received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child — which are administered at the ages of 12 months and four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But blood tests in the hospital revealed she had no antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, people who are fully vaccinated against measles will have antibodies in their blood, although in some cases these may not be picked up in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians gave her a booster dose against measles and discharged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible for immunity from the vaccine to wane over time, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. It is not clear whether Marcy had any underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her diagnosis online, she said: 'Hello, so I have, the measles', before gesturing to her rash-covered face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy is pictured above attending Taylor Swift's Eras tour more than a month before she was diagnosed with the disease. There is no risk that she could have been infected at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added in a comment: 'I was vaccinated as a child but my [tests] showed no evidence of immunity. They recommended a booster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said doctors initially thought her temperature was caused by the norovirus, before the rash erupted — leading to a measles diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn't feel the rash appear, but said that after a few days it started to itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I developed a rash without even feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was at home, minding my business, and then my husband came home and took a look at my face and said, "What the heck happened to your face?!".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I looked in the mirror and it's got a little worse, I am hoping the rash starts to get better tomorrow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Taylor Swift super-fan is pictured above before she was diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rash lasted for about five days before clearing, she said in the clip that was posted in mid-February and has been viewed nearly 20,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was able to return to work five days after her rash appeared, which is when someone is no longer infectious for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But said she was frequently exhausted and would come home from work and sleep immediately every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccination rates against measles have fallen in recent years amid false claims that the vaccine causes autism and mandates for Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ontario, only about 90 percent of residents have been vaccinated against measles — statistics suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in Gaines County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-70ca0170-ff53-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of America's latest outbreak, only about 82 percent of people have been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic users say their exes are attempting to reconnect with them after weight loss: 'Second chance at love' - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxORlg1dkFfSVZXRWp6ZkR1VnhLelpUclJIR3V5aldPa3NjZzBmMTNQSUdDaHYyM0dVZU9xX2hhX2c3YlZmYnVKekluOGZfRTB4dzFXSnZrTUtpdXRPUXhTX2xZdXF2WFFYYjZzQ19GY3lMTkkxMTY1U1FoUGExOFI0dXBRbmoxSFlYckEzVVJVRjZybWxXRGpLWUVYQ0t4RFlFQUM4MVFOUl9BZlcyX2hJa0pwTC1OS0ZXS0kxTnhiUEVsZGVwU0J6Z0Nab0xnX2N4emdaQnJzYmVIUFN0MkZxVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;It’s an unexpected Ozempic side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slimmed-down users of GLP-1 drugs say their exes have started sliding into their DMs &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ziphealth.co/how-are-glp1s-impacting-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A recent survey by ZipHealth&lt;/a&gt;, which polled 1,000 individuals using Ozempic, Mounjaro and other similar treatments, found that one in five found former flames reaching out to re-connect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One in five users found that former flames — exes or crushes — reached out to reconnect, especially Gen Z and millennial users.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;dodotone – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women on Ozempic were more likely to experience a blast from the past than male users of the same drug. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, nearly one-quarter of single surveyed Ozempic users reported receiving more matches or unsolicited messages on dating apps since starting their GLP-1 regimen.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;This influx of interest helped one in 10 single users enter a new romantic relationship after shedding some pounds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One in 10 single users enter a new romantic relationship after shedding some pounds. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nebojsa – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These changes convinced nearly half of GLP-1 users that these medications gave them a “second chance” at love.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drugs helped them shed more than just weight — it also helped them shake off shame and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of those surveyed reported feeling more confident after starting the medication, with women being 12% more likely than men to experience this boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This confidence extended to all corners of their lives, including the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These changes convinced nearly half of GLP-1 users that these medications gave them a “second chance” at love.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Zip Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of GLP-1 users also found themselves feeling friskier and more adventurous in the bedroom, with one in five even exploring new sexual positions since their weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because they’re not just looking good; they’re feeling good. While people’s weight decreased, their libido increased — 39% of millennials, 37% of Gen Z and 35% of Gen X. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, men reported a stronger uptick in libido (40%) than women (35%), although &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/26/lifestyle/ozempic-allegedly-causing-embarrassing-sexual-side-effect/"&gt;others have complained of having the opposite reaction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some users experienced a negative impact on their romantic relationships, with one in 10 respondents reporting that their weight loss transformation led to jealousy or insecurity from their partners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But more often than not, these medications changed people’s relationships for the better. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About four in five GLP-1 users in relationships said they noticed improved emotional intimacy with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, with all these emotional and sexual benefits, the majority of people felt they had to keep the weight off to appease others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;But more often than not, these medications changed people’s relationships for the better.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;millaf – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly three in five users felt they had to maintain their weight loss out of fear of judgment or losing this newfound attention — a pressure felt stronger by women (64%) and Gen Xers (60%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/"&gt;going blind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/13/health/woman-suffers-life-threatening-bowel-injury-from-ozempic-suit/"&gt;suffering from life-long diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/ozempic-cuts-booze-cravings-in-people-with-alcohol-use-disorder-study/"&gt;battling addiction&lt;/a&gt; and finding love, people who take Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications are seeing that the drugs are doing more than reshaping bodies; they’re reshaping lives — for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;

But experts say that even with more than 250 cases reported across the three states, the outbreak is likely much larger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My gut tells me there are cases that are unreported — you don’t have to come in and get tested for measles,” said Katherine Wells, the director of public health in Lubbock, a Texas city on the edge of the outbreak where some sick children have been taken to be hospitalized. “It’s going to be a long process to get everything measles-free again in this area, but I can’t tell you if that’s 500 cases or a thousand.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and other experts believe they are capturing only a fraction of cases for reasons that have to do with the epidemiology of the outbreak as well as reports of a lack of cooperation among some people in the areas where cases have been detected. But a large part of it is simple math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas officials reported last month that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/26/texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt;an unvaccinated child had died of measles&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s first measles death in a decade. In New Mexico, health authorities are investigating &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;another possible measles fatality&lt;/a&gt;, an unvaccinated person who tested positive for the virus after death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fatality rate for measles is roughly one — perhaps up to three — in every 1,000 cases. Even just the first death put experts on alert that the spread of the virus could be much wider than documented. In 2019, for example, the U.S. reported more than 1,200 confirmed measles cases, largely driven by an outbreak in and around New York City, but no deaths. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was the number one flag that this could be greatly underreported,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak in&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/measles-outbreak-grows-hantavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; her Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In theory, even if the second death is confirmed as having been caused by measles, two deaths in just a couple hundred cases is possible. But statistically, experts would only anticipate two measles deaths to occur in the U.S. with many, many more cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These two individuals could just be incredibly unlucky,” Jetelina said. “It’s just surprising, particularly given how few deaths we’ve had over the past 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During measles outbreaks, experts know they’re going to miss cases. But they have an advantage in detecting measles versus other viral infections; measles is accompanied by a telltale rash, meaning parents of sick children are more likely to take them to doctors than they would if they had the flu or Covid. There they would likely get tested. Measles is also a reportable disease, meaning health officials get notified of positive cases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in Texas, there have been&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9woKZxOjj5meGdY96Nwl46YecFd36589WhE6XqIP2hew1B3zLnbzGAkT8YP-Xr1Na48rYIaC4DiM_XTyiT-ASwoV3Bzg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351385696&amp;amp;utm_content=351385696&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; anecdotal reports that people have resisted&lt;/a&gt; efforts to expand testing. In part because of increased frustration with public health since the Covid-19 pandemic, people aren’t as willing to cooperate with case investigations. Some of the same distrust issues that have reduced vaccine uptake in recent years may also contribute to an unwillingness to seek testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have noted that some measles patients who have shown up at hospitals have been extremely sick, which suggests that some people are not seeking care unless it becomes an emergency — infections that might have been otherwise documented if people went to a doctor. The person who died in New Mexico never sought medical care at all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are also logistical issues. The outbreak is playing out across a very rural stretch of Texas, and while state and local officials have, with federal support, expanded testing access and started another lab in Lubbock to run tests, people might still have to travel extremely far to seek a test. At this point in the outbreak, the publicity around it may have convinced people who are infected but not sick enough to need medical care to just ride out their infection at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think people know what they’re dealing with because there’s so much information in the news,” Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might be especially true among adults who are infected. While the majority of cases in Texas are among kids, 38 adults have been confirmed to have measles. In New Mexico, the cases have mostly been documented in adults. The sizable number of adult cases &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/02/adult-measles-infection/"&gt;reflects a shift in the spread of measles&lt;/a&gt;, which used to almost always strike in childhood. But now, the kids whose parents avoided vaccination in the 1990s and 2000s have become adults themselves, adding to the pool of people who act as kindling to outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Texas, more than half of the 223 confirmed cases as of Tuesday have been identified in Gaines County, and many have been tied to a Mennonite community there with low vaccine uptake. But cases have also been reported in counties south of Gaines and all the way north to Dallam County, on the Oklahoma border, a stretch of some 300 miles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Oklahoma officials also reported two probable measles cases, based on the people’s symptoms and their exposure to cases in the Texas and New Mexico outbreak. State health officials said the two people realized they had been exposed and stayed home through their infectious periods, suggesting they had prevented onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say that even if they miss some cases, the more infections they can track, the better they can get their arms around an outbreak. With stronger surveillance, they can know where to surge additional testing and expand outreach with vaccination, the best approach to safely corralling outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has also taken on a political dimension. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;During a Tuesday interview &lt;/a&gt;with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/27/trump-administration-measles-outbreak-response-breaks-with-past/"&gt;has downplayed the severity of the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;also undersold the importance of vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to ending it, Fox News’ Sean Hannity referred to the measles outbreak as “relatively small.” Kennedy, reiterating comments he’s made earlier about the outbreak, also noted that there are multiple measles outbreaks every year. (An outbreak is defined only as three or more connected cases, and most only result in a small number of infections.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jane Zucker, formerly the assistant commissioner of New York City’s health department, said she started to notice a shift in some people’s willingness to get tested during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak there. Typically during an outbreak, with heightened awareness of the virus, people want to confirm that what they’re sick with is measles. But during the New York outbreak, Zucker said, “a lot of those rules were really broken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she and colleagues&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, the health department only learned about some infections “several weeks to months” later, when parents would bring kids in for serologic testing — a blood test that can show that someone has immunity to a virus, either from vaccination or a prior infection — so that the kids could get back to school. (Unvaccinated children were only allowed at schools if they could demonstrate they had recovered from an infection.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As they wrote, “delayed identification of measles in these situations hindered the ability of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement real-time control measures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	As a major &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreak spreads out of West Texas &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/health/measles-outbreak-texas-oklahoma-new-mexico/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;into other states&lt;/a&gt;, Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread a confusing message about vaccine safety. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Tuesday, Kennedy touted the vaccine — but also suggested that the best way to get lifetime immunity from the measles is to simply become infected with measles, and that the measles vaccine is dangerous to those who take it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It used to be — when you and I were kids — that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899636733693554878" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; from inside the Steak &amp;amp; Shake fast food restaurant where the interview was conducted. “The vaccine is effective for some people for life, for many people it wanes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1-3 of every 1,000 childhood measles infections would result in death due to respiratory or neurological complications from the highly virulent disease. Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000 after the implementation of a successful, two-dose national vaccination campaign that lasted decades. Until recently, measles cases detected in the United States nearly always originated from foreign travel.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is incredibly effective, and incredibly safe. Two doses in early childhood are 97 percent effective against measles, according to the CDC, and complications are extremely rare. However, if you ask our nation’s health secretary — a known vaccine skeptic — taking the MMR vaccine could be just as risky as catching a deadly infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes — encephalitis, blindness, et cetera,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899637162817036510" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Hannity. “So people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“One of the problems is that [the vaccine] does not appear to provide maternal immunity,” Kennedy said. “It used to be that very young kids […] they were protected by breast milk, and by maternal immunity. Women who get vaccinated do not provide that level of maternal immunity to the natural measles infection, so you’re now seeing measles hit very very young kids and hitting older people.”At one point Kennedy suggested that deaths attributed to measles in the past had been primarily caused by malnutrition and comorbidities. 

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy failed to mention that the majority of recent American measles outbreaks have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/30/increase-measles-cases-unvaccinated-vaccine-misinformation-cdc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;linked to communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination levels are dropping due to vaccine skepticism, or are below the rate needed to preserve social immunity. While breastfeeding women can temporarily pass along antibodies to their children through breast milk, the immunity benefits have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;been found to wane&lt;/a&gt; before the child reaches their first birthday, and vaccination is still recommended for long-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The health secretary noted a commitment to “encourage” people to get vaccinated, but did so as an offhand comment amid another bout of fear mongering about the dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccines/" id="auto-tag_vaccines" data-tag="vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; — which are significantly less than those of a measles infection. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy’s handling of the measles outbreak in Texas has been blasted by lawmakers and public health officials. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-handling-west-texas-measles-outbreak-1235290478/"&gt;he took a hiking trip&lt;/a&gt; to the Coachella Valley as &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hhs/" id="auto-tag_hhs" data-tag="hhs"&gt;HHS&lt;/a&gt; officials scrambled to bring the outbreak under control, and later pushed vitamin A as a way to combat the disease, despite health experts noting that vitamin A only helps when someone already has a vitamin A deficiency.. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last month, during a meeting of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Kennedy asserted that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;downplayed the severity&lt;/a&gt; of the caseload. The Texas Department of Health the very same day confirmed the first measles death in the United States in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA—The Philadelphia Department of Public Health and Pennsylvania Department of Health are notifying the public of a potential measles exposure at the following locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This building includes CHOP Pediatric Primary Care South Philadelphia, Health Department Health Center #2, and the South Philadelphia Library, though there were no potential exposures in the library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1700 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday, March 7, 2025, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday, March 8, 2025, between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHOP Emergency Department
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday, March 10, 2025, 7:55 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This measles case was exposed while traveling abroad and is not connected with the recent measles case identified in Montgomery County, or cases in other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles.” said &lt;strong&gt;Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson&lt;/strong&gt;. “We know that this measles case is not associated with either the recent case in Montgomery County or the ongoing outbreak in Texas. As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That’s why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Department Immunization Program Medical Director Dr. Mayssa Abuali&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The two-dose MMR vaccine series is 97 percent effective in preventing measles infections and confers lifelong protection. However, many places outside of the U.S., and increasingly within the U.S., do not have enough people vaccinated to prevent measles disease within communities. When traveling outside of the U.S. and to areas where there is an existing outbreak, travelers should talk to their healthcare provider about an early MMR vaccination for children aged 6-11 months and second doses for travelers at least two weeks before the trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a virus that spreads very easily from person to person among unvaccinated people. Anyone with measles can spread the virus to others who are not immune through direct contact with respiratory droplets, or through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Measles is contagious for 4 days before to 4 days after the rash starts. In some people, including infants and those with weakened immune systems, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection, or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won’t completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Health Department recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were potentially exposed at any of the previously listed locations during the indicated times, you should follow the instructions below to determine if you are protected (immune) from measles, and symptoms to look out for if you are not protected. If you were not in these buildings during those times, you do not need to follow these instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if you are protected against measles. Generally, you are considered protected if you:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were born before 1957,&lt;em&gt; or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have already had measles, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a blood test showing immunity to measles, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at your vaccination records or ask your healthcare provider to see if you have already had the age-appropriate dose or doses of this vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measles vaccine is routinely recommended for children 12–15 months old with a second dose given at age 4–6 years. Infants under 12 months are not routinely eligible for vaccine and are not protected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not protected from measles, there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the CHOP Emergency Department on March 10 during the times listed above, you should receive a dose of MMR vaccine before Thursday, March 13. Talk to your healthcare provider to learn how you can get this vaccine. The Health Department has &lt;a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphila.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D48732a6251c09f25e0086d47a%26id%3D047c5fec3e%26e%3D5dc8f624ef&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Chans.kellner%40phila.gov%7C0450c002dd244a67844c08dd61721d56%7C2046864f68ea497daf34a6629a6cd700%7C0%7C0%7C638773864933454654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qbSTFPfL%2FuPoG1ukiXr1dwoTv42QB%2FZ72%2FvDzstr5lw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;additional resources on where to get vaccines on their website&lt;/a&gt;. If you do not receive an MMR vaccine, you will need to stay home for 21 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 7 during the times listed above, you should contact your healthcare provider and stay at home until Thursday, March 27. Contact your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 8 during the times listed above, you should contact your healthcare provider and stay at home until Friday, March 28. Contact your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are under 12 months of age, pregnant and not immune, or are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system) and were at any of the exposure locations, you should consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you develop any measles-like symptoms through Monday, March 31, 2025, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Tell your doctor before visiting that you may have been exposed to measles. You should also notify the Philadelphia Department of Public Health by calling 215-685-6740, then pressing option 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia generally has very good MMR vaccine coverage rates. The Pennsylvania Department of Health recommends that at least 95 percent of people be fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine to confer herd immunity, which protects residents who cannot be vaccinated due to age or a weakened immune system. During the 2023-2024 school year, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported that 97.5 percent of 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade Philadelphia school students and 97.1 percent of 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students were up-to-date on MMR vaccine.

                                &lt;p&gt;St. Luke's University Health Network has put out a release on Hantavirus in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are a family of viruses that have caused serious illnesses and death in people worldwide, including Pennsylvania, says St. Luke's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Luke's says the last know case in Pa. was in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hantavirus’s role in the recent tragic death of the actor Gene Hackman and his wife provides an opportunity to educate the public about this virus and implications for residents in our area,” said Jeffrey Jahre, MD, St. Luke’s Senior Vice President of Medical &amp;amp; Academic Affairs and Section Chief Emeritus of Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although hantavirus disease is an uncommon illness in humans and is particularly rare in our region, it has been reported in 41 states including Pennsylvania and some surrounding states, Jahre says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say it is transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodents or their excreta, primarily through inhalation of airborne particles including dust containing the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Luke's says the risk of exposure is elevated this time of year for people opening summer homes and hunting lodges since such dwellings are often subject to rodent infestations during the winter. In the United States, deer mice are the most common vector, but other rodents including the white-footed mouse, rats and voles are also potential carriers, according to St. Luke's. (There is no human-to-human transmission.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say regions of the United States that have a higher incidence of hantavirus disease include the Southwest, particularly the Four Corners area of New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado, as well as the western states of California, Washington and Montana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical incubation period for hantavirus is two to three weeks followed by an onset of fever, chills and severe muscle aches, according to St. Luke's University Health Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common respiratory symptoms other than a cough are notably absent, according to the release. Because the initial symptoms are nonspecific, officials say they are unlikely to lead to the correct diagnosis if not also accompanied by a known history of recent rodent contact. Serologic testing is used to confirm the diagnosis, says St. Luke's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Luke's reports that the cardiopulmonary phase of the disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of low blood pressure and a flooding of fluid in the lungs known as pulmonary edema which, without immediate ventilatory support, can lead to death. Officials say there is no other specific treatment other than supportive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are steps to minimize improper contact with rodents and their excreta including feces, saliva and urine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before entering a long vacant dwelling without protective gear, allow it to fully air out for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seal all potential rodent entry sites using steel wool or other impermeable material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use effective traps for rodents that may be present. Consult a professional for sealing and trapping if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use effective protective gear including gloves, goggles, properly fitted N95 or KN95 masks when handling dead rodents, nests or droppings and urine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not sweep or vacuum the affected areas to avoid aerosolizing viral particles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wet down the contaminated areas with a dilute bleach solution of one part bleach to nine parts water or a recognized disinfectant and use paper towels to blot up the area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash hands thoroughly after handling rodents or their waste products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Properly dispose of used gloves, masks and contaminated materials in sealed bags.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid camping in areas where rodents are known to be present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience flu like symptoms after exposure to rodents, St. Luke's says seek immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the prevalence of hantavirus in Pennsylvania and other states, see the &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/HantaviruscaseView/#!/Map" target="_blank"&gt;CDC hantavirus map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

href="/health/article-14481709/international-airport-measles-alert-maryland-virginia.html"&gt;New York's JFK International Airport &lt;/a&gt;and Washington &lt;a target="_self"

target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14487651/texas-father-daughter-measles-death.html"&gt;amid a major outbreak &lt;/a&gt;of the disease in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a8a70880-ff45-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has already sickened more than 250 people and led to 29 hospitalizations and two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is spread via respiratory droplets expelled via coughs and sneezes that can hang in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infected patients first suffer from a fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat before developing the characteristic red rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, including the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After arriving on March 5, local health authorities said the patient visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood between 11am and 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether the patient was vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On March 10 the patient went to Superior Grocery Store in El Monte from 8.15am to 10.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear when the person first showed symptoms for measles or when their infection was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with the disease, however, patients are told to isolate and if symptoms become severe enough, they may be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are typically treated with painkillers, but may also receive antibiotics if they develop an associated infection or Vitamin A if they show signs of being malnourished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, they may also need assistance breathing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Muntu Davis, Los Angeles county's health officer, said: 'With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to other before they feel sick or have symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two of the airport-linked measles patients have arrived in the US on China Airlines flights this year, while one has arrived on a Korean Air flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second case in Los Angeles is in a resident, while the first case was in a foreign traveler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no reports suggesting an outbreak of measles in China or South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But late last month, officials in Ontario, Canada, also raised the alarm over measles after an infected passenger arrived in the area from South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the US, measles has not been officially eradicated in China, which records low numbers of cases every year, but it was officially eradicated in South Korea in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but cases have repeatedly emerged since — linked to passengers bringing in the virus from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over recent years, the vaccination rate against measles has dropped, however, amid Covid vaccination mandates and concerns over the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective against the virus, which can cause death or leave patients with a life-long disability in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:29:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Within a few months, he contracted measles, one of the most contagious diseases on the planet and back then a killer of hundreds of American children each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W5H4T5RAAJH6PF7T2UVYQSUTWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As he recovered in isolation &lt;a href="https://www.fayschool.org/news-detail---magazine?pk=1249137"&gt;in the Fay School’s infirmary&lt;/a&gt;, David received a visit from &lt;a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2010/07/25/dr-thomas-peebles/"&gt;Thomas Peebles&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital in Boston, 25 miles away. When Peebles and his colleague &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1954/enders/facts/"&gt;John Enders&lt;/a&gt;, in a hurry to develop a measles vaccine, learned of the outbreak at Fay, Peebles visited David and asked if he’d like to help the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUDPISFYSVGRZM3QZNVRBVRLDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David recalls giving blood samples and having his throat swabbed, as well as gargling something that tasted of sour milk. A few weeks later, Peebles returned to let David know that the samples had produced exactly what the scientists needed: the measles virus, which they planned to isolate and develop into a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DMN57ID3RFCHBR3NOSDKLXSAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor offered David a steak dinner for his troubles, but he declined: “I wasn’t too keen on steak, so I said, ‘No, thanks,’” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ERHI5QXNBAQBCJJRJBSVPKOLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took several years for the scientists to turn David’s virus sample into a vaccine and years to test its efficacy and safety, but when it finally was licensed in 1963, it was named for the boy whose illness made the advance possible: The Edmonston-B strain led to the Edmonston-Enders vaccine, a version of which is still used today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OWPFUY44JBDTVO2KUU67SITDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CBS flew David from Washington to New York to appear on TV with the scientists to celebrate the vaccine, part of an extensive public health campaign that persuaded an overwhelming majority of parents to immunize their children — leading to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;elimination of measles&lt;/a&gt; from the country in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWOAQD2JF5BBHM625Z2ISCQTPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After college and a stint in the Deep South protesting with civil rights advocates, Edmonston settled into a life remodeling homes. He’d never had much interest in science, but he married a public health teacher, and when they had a son in 1980, they decided not to vaccinate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="32V5AGO2UREWNOL37TEMG2D4QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My wife read an article that a researcher wrote, saying that the measles vaccine might give children a disease,” Edmonston said. “It was scary. My wife thought it was better not to vaccinate him. And I agreed to it: She was the mother, and had some public health training. He never did get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BG3JC7PTNNG43M7NTE4K5QMBUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Edmonston’s wife died two decades ago. He has lived for many years in a spiritual community based on Indian meditation, many of whose adherents, he says, are vaccination skeptics. Especially once the covid pandemic hit, he saw his friends “latch onto the idea that vaccines are dangerous,” he said, “and they became almost religious about it. I’ve struggled for years to understand why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F4AOGIO74VDYLODUSBXK7PFFCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As people around him turned against vaccines, he read some of the science and pivoted the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KUCJOAHHW5DWVBWPVZF5VVURHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The more I thought about it, the more I returned to my feeling for the degree of intellectual honesty of the doctors I met all those years ago — their basic integrity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXFCZ2H25BENZEBBXJBHJJKP4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His vaccine-hesitant friends “are more willing to think in intuitive ways, rather than rational thinking,” Edmonston said. “I’ve lived in both those worlds. I’m by nature a more rational person, but I’ve become more intuitive in my work with this spiritual group. I still struggle with how to persuade people who are more intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BM7VRJE3SJHJXD354WM4HVEKCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A marshaling of facts doesn’t do the trick. Statistics showing that the measles vaccine has saved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7345a4.htm"&gt;60 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in this century alone don’t persuade the resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AR3T4VYCOVCYHE4NGKRSXTDEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it doesn’t help to have authority figures such as Kennedy and Donald Trump, who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/the-measles-book-childrens-health-defense-vaccine/"&gt;spread doubt&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines even as they sometimes claim to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JK4T2I3GWJBSBPLZDP6LU7W7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Edmonston got the covid shots, he emailed his friends, urging them to protect their communities (to little effect).

Disease in Childhood. They showed that in each case the child became acutely unwell with a cluster of symptoms soon after drinking a slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The children fell ill as a result of what the study referred to as glycerol intoxication syndrome, which caused symptoms such as decreased consciousness and low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slushies maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the UK, slushies containing glycerol are not recommended for children under the age of four. The review team at University College Dublin, led by the consultant paediatrician Prof Ellen Crushell, called for health advice to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All but one of the cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments. The review team suggested drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol. It also recommends consumption be limited to no more than one slush a day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with the advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar. But one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPanZ2RWNBRFh3QUxRMEpjNVc0alZmNEV2ZmhhUUlXNnNhMnR5anhLMlIydHdhNWN3NVVWNzVrX1Q5MGJtRkhuODBKWnNua2FKaUJlX2ptUXh6cXNGR0RIZ0RVYnliU0h2MnA2UmU0VGNfd0pjcVhYamo2d2dKam1fMi1PQXFOd3VValEtVUs3Q3otUzl0ODlrVTIzWFhTdEpObXJQWmQwUTZaNkN1dVZlS0FYREtudXZTWEE</guid></item><item><title>Cher the cow and other herds face new threat as bird flu reaches Arizona cattle - AZ Luminaria</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOMllNVXV1Q0w0Wm0xMkhmR1E0WGdaczRwWWdfY1U2RDh4QkpYVDhZNFp0Wjl4RjdfYjJObkFqUmhSSkp2akZoNjdtal9sV0wzelh2YWtpV3llVUNZRXFZUWFaTVJBWmozcWZaM3FuM2VMbTFoM0RiNVNGZmtjQVFqUDJNVnRqcWpndmlZaVVBYW1pVVl5RmhoVVEwWW91N2U4Uk02elJzSWxxMWduOWUxVEgzbXN0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		&lt;p&gt;Cher was giving Christina Brownlee kisses with her long, black and pink tongue. At well over 1,500 pounds, the cow — named Cher for her propensity to bellow, as well as maneuver to the front of a crowd — is part of a herd of cattle at University of Arizona’s campus agricultural center in the heart of Tucson.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee, a professor at UA’s College of Veterinary Medicine, said she and other researchers refer to the cows living at the &lt;a href="https://experimentstation.arizona.edu/campus-agricultural-center"&gt;agricultural center&lt;/a&gt; as “grass puppies.” Cher and the other cows in the Tucson herd are neither beef nor dairy cows; rather, students training to be vets learn to care for and handle them. But Cher is still under threat: from a virus.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Symptoms of bird flu include: pink eye (conjunctivitis), fever, fatigue, cough, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and stuffy or runny nose. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Learn &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/index.html"&gt;how to take precautions&lt;/a&gt; to protect against infection or the spread of bird flu.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Ranchers and producers can find more information &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock/enhance-biosecurity"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case of bird flu in cattle in Arizona was in mid-February in Maricopa County. Bird flu or avian flu is a generic name for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22401-bird-flu"&gt;a variety of viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the strain H5N1 is responsible for outbreaks in poultry, wild birds, and now cattle.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arizona Department of Health Services is collaborating with the Arizona Department of Agriculture “in the response to avian influenza and will continue to monitor influenza activity in Arizona in collaboration with local health departments. While the risk to the general public remains low, workers and individuals that may be at risk for exposure to avian influenza should follow public health guidance,” said Nicole Witt, the department of health services assistant director of preparedness in a Nov. 14 news release.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee says there needs to be more and more clear guidance for Arizona’s cattle industry, not only to protect herds, but the ranchers who rely on them and the public that consumes dairy and beef, and to slow the interspecies spread of the virus.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_1169407939"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_1169407939" zone-id="159788" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,community,environment,cher-the-cow-and-other-herds-face-new-threat-as-bird-flu-reaches-arizona-cattle,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,in%20more%20than%20200%20mammals"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;, at least 70 people in the United States have been infected with the virus so far, and one person has died. There have been no recorded cases in humans in Arizona, according to the CDC.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the country, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;millions of poultry&lt;/a&gt; have been affected, leading to the killing of almost 150 million chickens. That has led to spiking egg prices. Wild birds and house cats have also been infected. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle have been infected in 17 states, with almost 1,000 herds affected as of early March. In the last 30 days, as of March 6, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;confirmed cases in four states&lt;/a&gt;, including Arizona.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee said the first case in Arizona cattle was the same strain seen in Texas. It wasn’t a new strain, “which is good,” Brownlee said. “As the viruses change, that’s when we worry about them jumping species.”

Photo by Michael McKisson.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brownlee repeatedly emphasizes that “our food is safe,” she says drinking raw milk poses a much greater risk. But being safe now doesn’t mean that things couldn’t quickly change for the worse.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/news-release-avian-influenza-update/"&gt;Dec. 6 press release&lt;/a&gt;, the state health department is:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with local, state, and federal partners to monitor bird flu in farm animals and people who work closely with poultry and dairy cows.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Distributing protective gear to farm workers who have contact with infected animals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Helping ensure individuals with symptoms of or exposure to bird flu have access to testing and treatment; providing prophylactic treatment to individuals who may have been exposed to bird flu. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conducting timely public education efforts to ensure those impacted have information about avian influenza.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no emergency plan for this right now,” Brownlee says of the outbreak. She pointed specifically to the State Veterinarian’s Office of Arizona’s Department of Agriculture, saying they should be doing more to inform both the public and producers about the threats and precautions that could be taken.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Luminaria reached out to the veterinarian’s office. They did not respond.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a fire off in the distance. Let’s see if it fizzles out, goes away,” she said. “But if we know anything about viruses, they don’t go away. They just change.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to statistics kept by the &lt;a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/h702q636h/sf26b275x/h989sz55j/catl0125.pdf"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, there are about a million cows in Arizona.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee said that despite the cattle industry’s importance to the state, there hasn’t been a lot of guidance about how to respond to the threats of the bird flu. Nor has there been additional funding, she says, gently pushing away Cher’s big head again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That paucity of guidance is why Brownlee is launching a survey for Arizona cattle ranchers. She said producers have struggled to get information that is reputable. “I’m researching this, trying to figure out how we can help producers with their biosecurity protocols,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the survey’s introduction, “The ongoing situation, which has significantly impacted livestock trade across the United States, underscores the rapid adaptability of the virus and the necessity for prompt action to prevent further spread.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee hopes ranchers recognize that same urgency and start taking precautions.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most critically, that would include greater biosecurity practices and more consistent testing, Brownlee says.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee defined biosecurity as basically knowing who and what comes onto a farm. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of agricultural facilities have tried to open their doors up to expose people to agriculture,” Brownlee said, such as schoolchildren taking field trips to see milk cows. “That’s great education, but that also opens them up to a huge biosecurity risk,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said cattle are curious. If someone drops something over a fence, the cows will go and check it out.

Photo by Michael McKisson.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, Peach — a smaller cow with a rufous-brown coat and a twisting cowlick on the top of her huge head — snapped her attention to Arizona Luminaria’s photographer, appearing ready to swallow his camera.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ag industry wants to be transparent about how the animals are being treated, but flu threats make us need to be more secure,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Dairymen of Arizona have begun suggesting putting on biohazard suits when directly managing cattle, Brownlee said. Cooperatives like UDA have taken their own precautions, and Brownlee says they’ve been reimbursing the costs for individual producers testing for bird flu. Brownlee said that the state, too, has been reimbursing some test costs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, she emphasized, with a changing, species-jumping virus on the horizon, both the state and individual producers need to do more to safeguard their herds.

Researchers emphasize these memory-enhancing methods could significantly benefit public education and digital literacy programs, addressing misinformation challenges in health, politics, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of misinformation resistance is directly tied to how well individuals recall initial training interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Booster Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular memory-focused reminders significantly extend the duration and strength of misinformation resistance, similar to medical vaccine boosters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Text, video, and gamified methods were all effective, highlighting the broad potential for scalable anti-misinformation programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that targeted psychological interventions can significantly enhance long-term resistance to misinformation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “psychological booster shots,” these interventions improve memory retention and help individuals recognize and resist misleading information more effectively over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, explores how different approaches, including text-based messages, videos, and online games, can inoculate people against misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Potsdam and King’s College London conducted five large-scale experiments with over 11,000 participants to examine the durability of these interventions and identify ways to strengthen their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested three types of misinformation-prevention methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text-based interventions, where participants read pre-emptive messages explaining common misinformation tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video-based interventions, short educational clips that expose the emotional manipulation techniques used in misleading content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gamified interventions, an interactive game that teaches people to spot misinformation tactics by having them create their own (fictional) fake news stories in a safe, controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were then exposed to misinformation and evaluated on their ability to detect and resist it over time. The study found that while all three interventions were effective, their effects diminished quickly over time, prompting questions about their long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, providing memory-enhancing “booster” interventions, such as a follow-up reminder or reinforcement message, helped maintain misinformation resistance for a significantly longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the longevity of misinformation resistance was primarily driven by how well participants remembered the original intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up reminders or memory-enhancing exercises were also found to significantly extend the effectiveness of the initial intervention, much like medical booster vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the researchers found that boosters that did not focus on memory, but rather focused on increasing participants’ motivation to defend themselves by reminding people of the looming threat of misinformation, did not have any measurable benefits for the longevity of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr. Rakoen Maertens from the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, said: “Misinformation is a persistent global challenge, influencing everything from climate change debates to vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that just as medical booster shots enhance immunity, psychological booster shots can strengthen people’s resistance to misinformation over time. By integrating memory-boosting techniques into public education and digital literacy programs, we can help people retain these critical skills for much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol and a co-author of the study, emphasised the generality of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “It is important that the effects of the inoculation interventions were nearly the same for videos, games, and text-based material. This makes it much easier to roll out inoculation at scale and in a broad range of contexts to boost people’s skills in recognizing when they are being misled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the urgent need for scalable and more durable misinformation interventions and highlights the importance of collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and social media platforms to integrate these insights into public information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7949f859e848398879f9285d99a949e99838e8592b796939a9e99d9988fd99694d9829c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher McIntyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christopher McIntyre – University of Oxford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57205-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/a&gt;” by Rakoen Maertens et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of real-world interventions aim to preemptively protect or inoculate people against misinformation. Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPWlowcVcwLWVwNUh0Y1hidF9ici0xVWk4TUpScU45M2lGcVpPZ1dLWVhod3RqZGpRNmRUTEFiQU02aHJOUXJpd1hTUkhYRXJ3SDc1X09iYzhNVVQtbkxyQ1N5Z05zNEtyOEk1Zklla25RZlE1OTViZHR5a2RUai1iUkZn</guid></item><item><title>Rewriting Neuroscience: Possible “Foundations of Human Intelligence” Observed for the First Time - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:51:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Makes More Alarming Comments About Measles Amid U.S. Outbreaks - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxONWtDSm9XdnBYd0hJVjVGMDZEMjZvRDNKRDQxOThpd2lOV3lia1pLOEZLUlVBQzBVaWZOLTZzWmhBUDI2X0l1aDVhQWw0WURLYzE5Y3hwYWNzTW9QcUFTQWtMcUVSLXFJVHdVYUpRX21pLVk2MXBHNThRQU5CR2pnd2xOaWXSAYoBQVVfeXFMTld6dnVsaFlpWVVCcjQ4Vk01VlNMeDY0R0JBdzNxeUxvbXZocFp5T1BtWEZ4OElUaE1vbWptc2JyRlRER3p6Mkx2Wm1MR25oMVRTU3hUTV80T0dZRW95U1EtMlN4U3hFS2piUmV1WFlZUkFfcXRXeG52aUpVZ1J5R0o1WGVoM1FNMDN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

We should have informed choice. And — but if people don’t want it, the government shouldn’t force them to do it. There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has stressed the measles vaccine is safe and effective. Its website lists extensive information about the vaccine, including potential side effects and warnings for people who shouldn’t get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s skepticism around vaccines is well-documented.

And the drinks aren't likely to be a cause of concern when consumed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell said the children were so sick they were referred for genetic testing because the pediatricians in the emergency departments suspected a metabolic disorder. Most of them came into the emergency room unconscious, she said. One child had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Glycerol is a sugar alcohol naturally found in fats and oils that is used as a sugar replacement. Besides slushie drinks, it is sometimes added to various other foods such as protein bars and shakes, dried fruit, chewing gum, and sugar-free candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When consumed, it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and spread throughout the body's water stores. In large amounts, it can lead to excessive water retention and cause digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study suggests that young children may be more vulnerable to glycerol's effects because their smaller body size and developing metabolism make it harder for them to process and clear the compound efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Slush ice drinks have contained a lot of glycerol instead of sugar in recent years due to the increased demand for sugar-free food," Crushell explained. "To maintain the slush, you need either sugar or glycerol, but due to public health concerns and a sugar tax, sugar was reduced and glycerol was added."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should watch for any signs of drowsiness or reduced consciousness, slurring of speech, nausea, or general sickness after a child has downed a slushie drink, Crushell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If parents suspect that their child is becoming unwell, the first thing they should do is to stop them from drinking any more of the drink," she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell also recommended giving the child something sugary to eat and seeking medical attention if they have a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although this study only looked at children in the UK and Ireland, slushie drinks are also popular in the U.S., with sales of frozen drinks, including slushies, topping over $6B in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/regional-analysis/north-america-frozen-drinks-market-report" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the website Cognitive Market Research. The Food Standards Scotland and Food Standards Agency already recommends that the drinks should not be sold to children four years of age or younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell emphasized that there are many reasons to limit how many slushie ice drinks children consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The main takeaway is that slush ice drinks do not convey any health benefits to children, whether they're full of sugar or glycerol," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Heya Batah, MD is an internal medicine resident at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:21:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNVWo3Wl9QNTAwUndIZUE3TDBDUEh4OWp2ZFprcENFZE12Y2Rrc2JPQWJUaU1haGpya1F2cGZ1TzlQOTgzNkRFQnhBRVlFU1FzOEVkOTNNMWN0SFVlYXREU3VDaVNodndlWXRaaC11U3NQM2tsTHF5LTZZODBVUWZmZjh3ZGVkckxNQzNrSXRrcmdJeWJGTEZvSWZZT3BoeTg00gGmAUFVX3lxTE5TZ2NWeVp2d05NMnhKVzFReDRNeFJMVk9KN18tbjh1ckl6MDZJbVQzSUJEbjZqS2lkeHptMTBlQWtmWlRudUhnZjRYTHlTTGFvMVN5clNSQ1BPamFSUjR4RFh6UU0xZzBHU2p0ZTE3VnFUSVp0cUNEWU52dkJyTHFGX3BnZTlUMWdlM0R1NDZuRmJielp3S2hpVXlTVEdxdnNQdlNuRkE</guid></item><item><title>An urgent argument for the HPV vaccine - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPLS1XTDJ5ZTVlLUpiT1BOQTRXS3NYcTdsNUw2WmhxWWMtSW95MVp0Z2VtYnlrTkNwS2NzVlR5VE5abENCNHhqcjQwNkctOGJJbXlOQnZxT2ZHNlNWcjNmUnVONWExc3EyM3pyZnVKWWllcUZ0OHRIdF9fTTNXdzVnRXo1ZFFWTWRBN2VSNlpSVVk3dGZtSGs5bUhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Chris Riley's symptoms started in the summer of 2021. At first, he didn't think much about them. His throat felt a little sore, and he noticed hardening of his lymph nodes. At 57 years old, Riley was active and healthy. He biked everywhere and didn't even own a car.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley, it turned out, had oropharyngeal cancer, which develops in the tonsils or throat. In Riley's case, it had originated in his left tonsil, but by the time it was discovered — after visits to a dentist, a general practitioner, and an ear, nose and throat specialist — it had spread to his lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The cause, according to his doctors, was human papillomavirus, or HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV is a virus that can live and replicate in certain cells on the surface of the skin and mucous membranes, including the inner lining of the mouth, throat and genitals. While &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/hpv/types-of-hpv.html#:~:text=There%20are%20more%20than%20200,mucosal%20membranes%20or%20mucosal%20surfaces)." target="_blank"&gt;over 200 types of the virus exist&lt;/a&gt;, only a few can lead to cancer, usually many years or decades after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who isn't vaccinated against HPV will be infected at some point, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;9 out of 10 infections resolve&lt;/a&gt; within two years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Passed from person to person through skin-to-skin contact, usually during sexual activity, HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, which kills about 4,000 people in the United States every year. But the virus can also lead to warts and other malignancies, including cancer of the throat, anus and genitalia — it's linked to six types of cancers in total. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPV is responsible for approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;37,800 cases of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53252" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A safe and well-tolerated vaccine can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccines/reasons-to-get.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent about 90%&lt;/a&gt; of such cancers. But in the U.S., HPV vaccines continue to be among the most underutilized recommended vaccines, a tragedy that may worsen if Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, tries to discredit them and limit access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist who has spread false claims about the HPV vaccine, including the assertion that it can cause cancer, and has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-kennedy-health-secretary-ethics-390e47ac1dd11aeef954851a9a5358ac" target="_blank"&gt;benefited financially&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to support legal challenges against manufacturer Merck. His role gives Kennedy a powerful platform from which to further undermine vaccine acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;pledged to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; of Louisiana, a physician, that he would maintain the CDC's current vaccine safety and monitoring systems&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and back recommended vaccination schedules. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he also refused to accept decades of medical research validating the safety of vaccines. When &lt;a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-hearing-rfk-jr-refuses-to-say-hpv-vaccine-is-safe-to-sen-patty-murray-pressed-on-credible-accusation-of-sexual-assault/" target="_blank"&gt;questioned by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray&lt;/a&gt; of Washington, he declined to say whether he stands by his prior statements calling the HPV vaccine "dangerous and defective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An underutilized prevention tool&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be highly effective, HPV vaccines must be given at a young age, before the onset of sexual activity. An &lt;a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/news/2024/january/no-cervical-cancer-cases-detected-in-vaccinated-women-following-hpv-immunisation/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis from Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, where school-based programs promote universal HPV vaccination, showed no cases of cervical cancer in fully immunized women who received their first HPV shot at ages 12 or 13. In the U.S., the HPV vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a4.htm?s_cid=mm7406a4_w" target="_blank"&gt;has been credited&lt;/a&gt; with a 79% reduction in the incidence of cervical precancer in women ages 20-24.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Introduced in 2006, the HPV vaccine initially was approved only for girls and young women. Its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended use&lt;/a&gt; now includes everyone through age 26, though vaccination at ages 11 to 12 — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9980633/" target="_blank"&gt;or even earlier&lt;/a&gt; — is preferred. When the vaccine is initiated at ages 9 to 14, usually two doses are required. When the first dose is given at or after age 15, three doses are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333a1.htm?s_cid=mm7333a1_w#T2_down" target="_blank"&gt;Recent data&lt;/a&gt; indicates that only about 61% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 have completed the HPV vaccination series. Rates have stagnated in the last few years and lag far behind usage of other common adolescent immunizations to prevent meningococcal disease (88.4%) and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (89%).&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The HPV vaccine is crucial," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.venturafamilymed.org/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Carlos O'Bryan-Becerra&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician with Ventura County Medical Center in California and a 2022-23 vaccine science fellow with the American Academy of Family Physicians. He cited its ability to prevent oropharyngeal cancer and five other types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, many patients, their families, and even clinicians are unaware that HPV causes cancers beyond the cervix," O'Bryan-Becerra said. "This lack of awareness makes it even more important to promote the vaccine as a cancer prevention tool."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, most often seen in men, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132363/" target="_blank"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; rates of cervical cancer. Overall, men are 2.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with an HPV-associated malignancy and face mortality rates that are 2.8 times that of affected women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53255" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Treatment for oropharyngeal cancer can be brutal. Riley, a former Austin City Council member, started radiation and chemotherapy soon after his diagnosis. But it came with a tremendous cost. His salivary glands and taste buds were destroyed, and for months, he required a feeding tube to ensure adequate nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite frequent chocolate milkshakes, one of few foods he could still taste, he lost weight and became exhausted with even minimal activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I see people just eating normal diets and going to normal restaurants, and that will never be me again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Barriers to vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pervasive misinformation surrounding HPV and the safety and necessity of its vaccine remains an enormous hurdle for vaccine promotion. Some families assume, incorrectly, that the vaccine is only for girls or is indicated only after a young person becomes sexually active. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mistrust around immunizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains widespread. Some argue that the HPV vaccine encourages promiscuity, an allegation that has been &lt;a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/promoting-hpv-vaccine-doesn%E2%80%99t-lead-more-teen-sex-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;thoroughly debunked&lt;/a&gt;. Still others aren't convinced that HPV is a serious health threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy can occur even among medical and nursing staff, which undermines promotion efforts, says O'Bryan-Becerra.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cultural stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections contributes to such hesitancy. Many teenagers and their families feel embarrassed discussing the topic, which can deter them from seeking the vaccine. People of color, those who live in rural areas and those without private health insurance are less likely than others to be vaccinated against HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine represents a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. Yet, accurate information and access are often lacking in schools and even health clinics. Doctors and their teams need to provide clear guidance about the importance of early HPV vaccination, before a young person becomes sexually active, to provide the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without widespread proactive measures to educate and improve vaccination rates, we risk perpetuating falsehoods and health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley died last summer, after a final effort to treat his cancer with chemotherapy and immunotherapy failed. The cancer had returned about a year after his initial treatment and had spread to his liver. He had just turned 60. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the weeks before he died, he mused about HPV vaccines, which probably would have saved his life, had they been available to him as a child. He was perplexed by HPV vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just seems really strange to me that a parent would have an opportunity to protect their kid against something like what I've been through and yet would forgo that opportunity," Riley told me in our final conversation. If more parents understood the vaccine's lifesaving potential, he said, "people would be clamoring" for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthwatch.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Health Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lisadoggett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Doggett &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;is a family and lifestyle medicine physician at the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center of UT Health Austin, the clinical practice of Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.

One of the first neurosurgeons they saw painted a hopeless picture, telling the couple the tumor probably couldn’t be removed and would eventually result in paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jackie Loutzenhiser was terrified about the future and the impact on the couple’s three kids, ages 14, 11 and 6. The youngest has since turned 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I just kept thinking, I don’t know how we do this without him. This family does not work without him in it,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a lot of very grim thoughts,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strange sneeze sensation was a symptom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In December 2024, the couple met with Dr. Camilo Molina, a Washington University neurosurgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He told them the mass was an &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/rare-brain-spine-tumor/tumors/ependymoma" target="_blank"&gt;ependymoma&lt;/a&gt;, a benign tumor that filled the diameter of Loutzenhiser’s spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These rare tumors generally don’t metastasize to other parts of the body, but are “locally aggressive” — meaning they'll continue to grow and push on the healthy parts of the spinal cord and progressively cause a patient to lose function, Molina says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They strike about two to five people per million and can affect anyone, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They are entirely random,” Molina tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He’s young, healthy, athletic, conscientious. Never had a really a major health problem in his life, thinking that (he's) doing everything right. And then all of a sudden, something like this really completely disrupts your life in a somewhat catastrophic fashion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early warning signs of ependymoma include numbness, tingling and clumsiness. Looking back, Loutzenhiser noticed the skin on the sides of his torso was starting to get numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People may also feel unsteady, like they’re going to fall when they close their eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another symptom is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493237/" target="_blank"&gt;Lhermitte sign&lt;/a&gt; — a shock-like sensation through the body when the neck is bent forward. Loutzenhiser noticed that when he sneezed, he's get “an electrical burst” out to his elbows and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s impossible to know whether the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/lower-back-stretches-rcna74688" target="_blank"&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt; Loutzenhiser felt was related to the tumor, but Molina suspects he had some muscle spasms and nerve pain in the vicinity of tumor, which was “fortunate” since it led him to get the MRI, the neurosurgeon notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicate surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Molina told Loutzenhiser he would slowly continue to lose sensation and balance as the tumor grew. If it got big enough, he’d eventually start losing strength, coordination and could become incontinent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The options were to leave the tumor in and monitor it closely, or remove it right away in a surgery that came with some risks. Loutzenhiser wanted it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I don’t think that I could have mentally been able to handle knowing that it was in there,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-01-2df3a0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-01-2df3a0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-01-2df3a0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-01-2df3a0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-01-2df3a0.jpg" alt="Steve Loutzenhiser"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Loutzenhiser with his family at the hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Steve Loutzenhiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The delicate surgery took place on January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With Loutzenhiser lying face down on the operating table and under general anesthesia, Molina made a small incision on his upper back directly over the tumor, dissected the muscles until he reached the bony part of the spine and opened the ring to his spinal canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Every tiny piece of the spinal cord has a critical function in the body in terms of balance, sensation, motor function and control of bodily functions, so Molina had to move carefully to remove the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The procedure was “almost like defusing a bomb in little, tiny pieces,” Molina says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The neurosurgeon relies on a neural monitoring system during the surgery — little needles placed in Loutzenhiser’s head, arms, hands, legs and feet that send signals through his body to check if they’re getting through the spinal cord. If doctors are losing the signals as they’re working inside the spinal cord, they know they have to back off to avoid hurting the patient as they’re removing the mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you push it too much, they’re permanently paralyzed. But if you don’t push it enough, then you leave a big part of the tumor in there,” Molina says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He was able to remove the whole tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relearning to walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As soon as Loutzenhiser woke up after the surgery, he wiggled his feet to check if he still had movement in his legs. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was the best feeling I could have had at that moment,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was moving everything, and it was just the biggest weight off my shoulders,” his wife adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-04-c1628f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-04-c1628f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-04-c1628f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-04-c1628f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Steve-Loutzenhiser-teacher-tumor-mc-250307-04-c1628f.jpg" alt="Steve Loutzenhiser"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Loutzenhiser in physical therapy after his surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Steve Loutzenhiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It took about a month for Loutzenhiser’s legs to be fully functional again to the point he could walk on his own. Patients undergoing such spinal surgery have a temporary loss of coordination and need to retrain their brain, legs and trunk, Molina says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My feet felt like they were balloons,” Loutzenhiser recalls. “My motors were working, but my sensors weren’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he can walk, squat and go up and down the stairs, but he’s not cleared to run or jump for now. A big milestone was being able to snuggle with his daughter before she goes to sleep — something he couldn’t do since before his surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Loutzenhiser is back to work on a part time basis at Fort Zumwalt East High School, where he was recently named Educator of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He’s thankful for all the doctors, nurses, therapists and residents who treated him during the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s been like a decade worth of experiences in four months,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:11:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNb1ZIY1ZWeFp5d1plS2lzbDM4OW9QdlM2bGNhaS1DbjBOclBLNUJ2V1NQajdXWjVXSlJFdG84VUpfdm43SE5YbUR2OVVFdUktWG1qbF8xOHVLV1BDTG1iR3Fudm1wZU1aQXBIS2JaUzRJWlFLRkROYTV4bVhYQ0JIS2xTTEY5Y19veV81QnBNTTZlaWI5VFU5THBabmkwUjDSAVRBVV95cUxOTGpPM2hnSmE4SFVUdVFiLWxlcFEzOXA2V0E0S28tREFTcDRLaC1MTUJHdzhWZUExYWdmU3N1MFRIQmo5STJnaVVvbXY1YW9YMWZlRjQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak holds higher risk for pregnant women, babies - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQUWpzZTh1VlhCNGE0bTFzbnhyOXNmb1VFMTVzYzQzNUItbDhMR21hRW82TEZLUEZUdGstbnpaV0s5YVFYaWpFb2FVSEF2RkFkUmJXakhyY3FsWGd5ZGo3QUxwa2I2SXgySUhWOUJqUW9VelI1OFJNdXIyWXZTQlA4c2hnTkVDcVXSAX5BVV95cUxNMkZkMjV4QmxLOGNhMXFBQkRKS0FLMnpmNlY1Z3ZZWTBpNXQ4YXdEYUo4c3A4QmQ3ZTQ5RkFxX3BmeHplOVhXV2h0RTgzekdmSGdEMUFvbGVLOVZDeDdRS1F1cjRwRDhubXFFTkc0ck56Vm1BNURCRUJpV1lDa0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A newborn with measles is among the cases reported in the growing West Texas outbreak, Lubbock public health officials say. Experts say the case serves as a reminder that the disease can be especially dangerous for pregnant women and very young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is how widespread this epidemic is, that it’s even showing up in unvaccinated pregnant women,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xtbi6200083b6mma2pwf2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least two pregnant women have been infected in this outbreak, according to officials at Covenant Hospital in Lubbock. Eighty-one measles cases have been reported in children ages 4 and younger across Texas and New Mexico. This is part of the larger outbreak that now spans three states, including Oklahoma, and totals 258 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00033b5vq8qrja0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infant, who has recovered, was born to an unvaccinated mother who was recently infected with the virus, according to Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can cause a rash,  fever, red eyes and cough. Severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain. In some cases, the illness can be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00043b5vwiv4ekgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both newborns and pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from the measles virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00053b5vt11fici0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated mothers who get measles earlier in pregnancy risk low birth weight, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;premature birth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582537/#:~:text=Having%20measles%2C%20mumps%2C%20or%20rubella%20during%20pregnancy%20might%20increase%20the,is%20expected%20to%20be%20rare." target="_blank"&gt;still birth&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00063b5vopa6fyqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who get the infection later in pregnancy, there is a higher chance of passing the infection to the baby through vertical transmission – in which the virus passes through the placenta – or, more commonly, through airborne transmission right after birth.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xorjnn00003b5vmyp14und@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When their mothers have immunity against measles, babies younger than 6 months will have some immunity via her antibodies. But if a mother is unvaccinated or doesn’t have immunity, babies are left susceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00093b5vb4oh5z7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Neonates have a more fragile immune system, and their recovery could be more complicated,” says Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000b3b5vgb3jl66y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who are unvaccinated are themselves at higher risk of measles complications, such as pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000c3b5vhfj7guhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who aren’t pregnant can receive the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine up to 72 hours after being exposed to the virus, to prevent infection. But pregnant women cannot get the vaccine; instead, they can receive immunoglobulin, or antibodies, up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=People%20exposed%20to%20measles%20who,the%20clinical%20course%20of%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;six days&lt;/a&gt; after a measles exposure. Infants younger than 6 months can receive immunoglobulin after exposure, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000d3b5vp685paes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yee has never treated a patient with measles, but she has counseled pregnant women who were exposed to the virus but who hadn’t been vaccinated as children because of their parents’ wishes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000e3b5v800r2qi7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think most patients want to protect themselves, and perhaps there is some feeling of maybe regret or anger that they weren’t better protected,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000f3b5vgemlek79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although measles poses severe health risks, doctors are generally more concerned with how the viral infection rubella can affect newborns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000g3b5vzrcll7nc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women who are not vaccinated against measles are also not vaccinated against rubella,” noted Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Thus, these women are also at risk of having a baby with congenital rubella syndrome should they acquire rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000h3b5vpghfohxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among women who are infected with rubella early in pregnancy, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-rubella-vaccination/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Rubella%20can%20cause%20severe%20birth%20defects%20and%20death&amp;amp;text=When%20a%20pregnant%20woman%20is,heart%20defects%2C%20or%20developmental%20delays" target="_blank"&gt;90%&lt;/a&gt; chance the baby will have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html"&gt;congenital rubella syndrome.&lt;/a&gt; This can cause developmental delays, heart defects, deafness and cataracts. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-rubella-vaccination/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Rubella%20can%20cause%20severe%20birth%20defects%20and%20death&amp;amp;text=When%20a%20pregnant%20woman%20is,heart%20defects%2C%20or%20developmental%20delays" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 3 babies with congenital rubella syndrome will die before their first birthday. There is less risk when the infection occurs after &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2532864/#:~:text=If%20the%20fetus%20gets%20rubella,This%20vaccine%20is%20very%20safe." target="_blank"&gt;20 weeks&lt;/a&gt; of pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm85uq5ki00003b6m9hakan7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rubella was once common and widespread in the United States, but was eliminated in the US in 2004. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/vaccine-impact/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says fewer than 10 people in the US are reported to have rubella each year and they’re mostly linked to travel outside the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000i3b5v2b9rwaft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is highly safe and effective, according to experts. One dose confers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;93%&lt;/a&gt; immunity against measles and 97% against rubella. With the second dose, measles immunity rises to 97%, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000j3b5vwb42zyad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The most important thing you can do is … to get vaccinated,” Yee said. “Vaccines work. …This is preventable. This should not be happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xx8w6q00003b5vocxug2f8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cook described an outbreak curve, familiar to those who watched infections rise and fall during the Covid-19 pandemic, that is still on the “incline”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;His concerns are shared by other local physicians, such as Dr Philip Huang, director of the Dallas county’s department of health and human services, who told local &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-update-200-cases-spring-break/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; news affiliate: “There’s concern that

He worries that the immunocompromised and babies could be exposed to measles in doctor’s waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I personally don’t think I anticipated this, although I’m not surprised,” said Dr Tammy Camp, pediatric residency coordinator with Texas Tech University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Sciences Center, also in Lubbock. When fewer people vaccinate, she said, “you always know you’re ripe for the possibility of an outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. Doctors often use the example of a room full of people to illustrate this: if 10 unvaccinated individuals enter and one has measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=But%20measles%20can%20cause%20serious,if%20they%20are%20not%20protected." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nine leave infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC expects&lt;/a&gt; the outbreak to continue spreading and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season. Although measles was once a common childhood disease, it is not without risks and general misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The most common symptoms include a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Severe symptoms are less common but can be devastating: about one in a thousand infected children suffer severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, a condition that can lead to seizures, deafness and intellectual disability. Between one and three out of a thousand will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, scientists believe that measles infection can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections for months because it suppresses the immune system. Very rare conditions can also strike: about one in 25,000 children, or the equivalent of about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20561004/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;four each year&lt;/a&gt;, suffer a degenerative neurological condition called &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. The disease presents years after infection with dementia-like symptoms that are eventually fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20are%2097%25%20effective%20against%20measles,are%20eliminated%20from%20the%20body." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing the disease. The vaccine’s side effects, while uncomfortable, are typically transient, and include fever and rash. Rarer side effects, such as febrile seizure, are nearly 10 times less common than children dying from measles infection, according to studies cited by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html#:~:text=Two%20studies%20indicate%20that%20for,These%20symptoms%20rarely%20come%20back." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That can make a place like Lubbock vulnerable, even when it is not the center of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The risk has been particularly acute since the pandemic, when more children missed routine vaccinations due to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;clinic and school closures&lt;/a&gt;, and anti-vaccine activists have gained significant &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-group-ican-del-bigtree-rfk-jr-nearly-doubled-revenue-rcna185214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;political power&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying more donations during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;RFK Jr, once the nation’s foremost vaccine critic, has responded to the Texas measles outbreak by downplaying the virus’s dangers and the vaccine’s efficacy, framing vaccination as a personal choice, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending good nutrition and vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Then there’s the rhetoric about vitamin A and cod liver oil,” said Cook, who argues that it’s unhelpful to compare alternative treatments not tested in the US with a vaccine so effective it once helped eliminate measles in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Camp noted that, to some degree, “vaccines are the victim of their own success”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“When you have people who have never seen the disease,” she said, “it becomes easier to become fearful of the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOMi1kaW9xSEJGaW5Ea2RrdzJ6SzJEUjhHcEp6UWw3cmhZOU53YUFVbk1GZHI1TXc5QmFXZFhUdlVUOW9MZ2xucWw3bXY5M1AxNGNFV1ZRY0ZGdnc0MTJBNGs4c0RwR0xrdGZNdlBSY0lfeXYxWFoxbnNGbVpRTWZXTk1JOA</guid></item><item><title>Half the men in an HIV cure study stayed off treatment for nearly a year after a two-antibody shot - aidsmap</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNdFVaQjlGOGVoT0NXbHIzdWpuTWNoQnBEbWFxOUVkRVRXbHA3Z2JmYWJKUTJtZEt5WnZXdDNPNjNYa3VHMmlISW9iWV9QTEF4d2lRNHA5TkVhMkdBOTRwbDFCeEIwZmJhUEhSb1UtaFNIc3UzSUkwNGgyQ1QtTG1NWEFtaXRVaW04OXV0bmhUSDZka0wyZzdfSmttajRsRHVKRWk3LW9nbjYzdmVjSGlaSmhWNHg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field-item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/conferences/croi-2025"&gt;Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) &lt;/a&gt;opened in San Francisco on Sunday, there was a community workshop on HIV cure science, at which Dr Michael Peluso, a local HIV physician and cure researcher, flagged up two studies to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One is the RIO study,” he said. “This studied up to 70 people using a bnAb [broadly neutralising antibody] strategy. We don't know how many people achieved viral control in that study, but I think we're going to find out in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The other is the FRESH/Gilead study, which is done in South African women living with HIV, most of whom have subtype C virus. This is a really different population and it’s critically important for the global cure agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RIO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results from RIO were presented two days later. This study, conducted in the UK and Denmark, gave half of its 68 participants placebo saline infusions. The other half got infusions of long-lasting formulations of two antibodies that can neutralise HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="embed-glossary-wrap"&gt;

&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neutralising antibody (NAb) is an antibody that fully defends its target cell from an antigen. A broadly neutralising antibody (bNAb) is a neutralising antibody that has this effect against a wide range of antigens. A number of broadly neutralising antibodies have been isolated from persons living with HIV. Some of them are being studied and, in some cases, used in clinical trials, to defend humans against HIV infection, treat HIV infection, and kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells in latent reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eliminate a disease or a condition in an individual, or to fully restore health. A cure for HIV infection is one of the ultimate long-term goals of research today. It refers to a strategy or strategies that would eliminate HIV from a person’s body, or permanently control the virus and render it unable to cause disease. A ‘sterilising’ cure would completely eliminate the virus. A ‘functional’ cure would suppress HIV viral load, keeping it below the level of detection without the use of ART. The virus would not be eliminated from the body but would be effectively controlled and prevented from causing any illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a research study, when study participants are requested to interrupt their antiretroviral therapy (ART) and be closely monitored. Most of these studies are in the field that aims to eventually achieve ‘ART-free remission’ or ‘HIV cure’. They usually look at the time it takes for the viral load to rebound after the interruption, following which ART is restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halting of the function or replication of a virus. In HIV, optimal viral suppression is measured as the reduction of viral load (HIV RNA) to undetectable levels and is the goal of antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has persistent, detectable levels of HIV in the blood after a period of undetectable levels. Causes of viral rebound can include drug resistance, poor adherence to an HIV treatment regimen or interrupting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is 3BNC117, which sticks to the part of HIV’s envelope ‘spikes’ that lock on to the CD4 receptor on T-cells. The other is 10-1074, which blocks a different part of the envelope, the V3 loop. Immediately after their infusions, all participants were taken off their antiretroviral therapy (ART) in an analytical treatment interruption (ATI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty weeks after starting the ATI, all but three of the 31 placebo recipients had been put back on ART because their HIV had reappeared. RIO’s definition of viral ‘rebound’ was either a viral load of over 1000 for at least six weeks, or two consecutive viral loads of more than 100,000 at least a week apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, two of the remaining three placebo recipients have still not rebounded 120 weeks after starting their ATI, so are regarded as post-treatment controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bnAb recipients, however, only 12 of the 34 had had a viral load ‘rebound’ by week 20. To put it the other way, 65% of the initial participants had maintained viral loads below 1000, or 75% of those still in the study (some dropped out). This may be the highest proportion of participants with delayed viral rebound yet seen in a bnAb study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage of participants rebounding at week 20 was the study’s primary endpoint, but at this point bnAb recipients who were still virally suppressed were given another shot of the two antibodies and continued without ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 48th week after stopping ART, 57% had still not rebounded, and by week 72 – over 14 months after stopping ART – 39% had still not. Seven participants (24%) had not had a single viral load reading over 50 by this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief investigator &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/kick-didnt-kill-first-ever-randomised-hiv-cure-study-fails-eliminate-infected-cells"&gt;Professor Sarah Fidler of Imperial College&lt;/a&gt; London told the conference that 23.5% of bnAb recipients (eight people) had the typical viral rebound pattern of a rapidly increasing viral load within the first 20 weeks. Four of these ‘rapid rebounders’ had mutations in their HIV suggesting it would be resistant to 10-1074 (currently there is no assay for resistance to 3BNC117).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight per cent of bnAb recipients had a delayed reappearance of their HIV, between 20 and 72 weeks after stopping ART. Not all of these were single rebound events – many participants had viral loads that oscillated between undetectability and quite high values, up to 55,000, before restarting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left seven people with complete viral suppression – which, so far, has lasted 120 weeks or nearly two years after stopping ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, viral suppression cannot be explained solely by the levels of antibodies circulating in the participants. The two antibodies have half-lives of nine to ten weeks, so would have sub-therapeutic values by week 48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substudies found that the amount of intact proviral DNA in participants’ reservoir cells declined in all but one of the 22 participants in which it was measured, with a third of them having declines of over six logs (a millionfold decrease). At the same time, the amount of defective DNA incapable of producing live viruses increased slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a study that used three different assays to measure T-cell responses to HIV in the participants who did not experience viral rebound found that the strength of these responses increased between week zero and week 36 after stopping ART. This is despite the fact that, because they remained virally suppressed, there were not enough HIV viral antigens circulating to stimulate such responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicates that the bnAbs, as had been hoped, did more than simply neutralise viral particles – they had a ‘vaccinal’ effect of strengthening immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RIO, the participants were all cisgender men, with an average age of just under 40 and an average CD4 count at enrolment of 800 (the minimum CD4 count allowed was 500). They had all started ART, mainly integrase-inhibitor-based, soon after infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FRESH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from also having HIV, the participants in the second study, from &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2016/young-women-treated-very-early-hiv-infection-stay-hiv-negative-and-preserve-immune"&gt;the FRESH cohort&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa, could not have been more different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRESH (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health), established over a decade ago,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;combines epidemiology, cure research and community empowerment in young women in KwaZulu-Natal, the area with the world’s highest general-population HIV incidence. FRESH involves a cohort of initially HIV-negative young women who it tests for HIV very intensively, with RNA tests twice a week. This enables those who test positive to start ART at the earliest possible stage – at so-called Fiebig stage 1, within a couple of weeks of infection, when people first test positive for HIV RNA but have not yet become HIV antibody positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study presented at CROI shows that it is possible to conduct sophisticated cure research in a lower-income African setting. As well as extending cure research to a disadvantaged minority, it also investigates whether the kind of cure intervention that worked in RIO’s predominantly male, middle-aged and gay participants – who mainly had HIV subtype B – also works in a young female population with subtype C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FRESH study used different antibodies to RIO: long-lasting versions of VRC07-523, another CD4 binding site bnAb, and CAP256V2, which blocks the V1-V2 section of HIV’s envelope protein. It was designed as an open-label study without a placebo, and primarily as a safety study, as this particular pair of bnAbs has not been tested in people with HIV before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 20 participants, all but three of whom had their HIV diagnosed at Fiebig stage 1 and who started ART within three days of diagnosis. They remained on ART for an average of seven years (minimum 1.7 years). Because they had started ART so early, the majority had had a peak viral load no higher than 5000 and none of them has ever had a CD4 count below 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were tested for susceptibility to both bnAbs. Eleven were sensitive to both, seven to VRC07 alone, and two to CAP256 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were given an infusion of each antibody at the end of the first week of the study. In addition to the bnAbs, they also took &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2020/hiv-cure-croi-new-data-antibodies-vaccines-and-genetically-engineered-t-cells"&gt;an oral immune-enhancing drug called vesatolimod&lt;/a&gt;, starting a week before the antibody infusion and then every two weeks for 18 weeks. Five weeks after the bnAb infusion, they stopped their ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary safety and viral suppression data was collected at week 20, two weeks after their last vesatolimod pill and 14 weeks into the ATI. Still, the ATI was continued (in those who did not need to resume ART) until its 42nd week, and then optionally extended in those still without viral rebound to its 54th week, over a year after stopping ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria for restarting ART were similar to RIO’s – a viral load over 1000 for eight consecutive weeks, or a viral load of over 100,000 in two tests a week apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of safety, one person did have a severe immune reaction to the bnAbs – a so-called cytokine release – that meant she had to discontinue the study. Most other adverse events were injection site reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten participants needed to restart ART owing to the reappearance of their HIV before week 48 of the study. Another six had a delayed viral load rebound and although some did have moderate viral loads, they were able to delay restarting ART until week 48, the end of the per-protocol ATI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four participants, however, continued their ATI past that timepoint and have maintained either undetectable viral loads (in two cases) or viral loads that have never risen above 2000 in the other two, now for a median of 1.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principal investigator Professor Thumbi Ndung’u told the conference that while 12 participants had typical viral rebounds where their viral load rose steadily, eight had an oscillating viral rebound where their HIV appeared and then disappeared repeatedly, a pattern also seen in RIO. This suggests a highly dynamic competition between the participants’ HIV and the vaccine-like effect of the bnAbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FRESH study, concentrations of the two antibodies had declined to their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the level where they only neutralised half the virus, by 22 weeks after being given VRC07 and 31 weeks after CAP256, so viral suppression after this was probably due to the vaccine-like effect of the bnAbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the cure workshop, Michael Peluso commented that these two studies exemplified the most promising current area of cure research – of “antibodies that can be manufactured to target the most important areas of the virus, to either neutralise that virus itself or to improve immune responses against the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study was explicitly preliminary: Its sample size was only 42 people whose claims to have suffered long-term medical problems after vaccination were assumed to be accurate representations of their medical condition, defined by the researchers as “post vaccine syndrome,” or PVS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is early-stage and requires replication and validation,” the authors wrote. The study was conducted from late 2022 through late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body"&gt;Suppressing studies because of concerns about how they might be misused sets a dangerous precedent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Harlan Krunmholz, Yale School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the limitations acknowledged by the authors are that they couldn’t be sure that the subjects’ ailments might have stemmed from infections with COVID itself, rather than vaccination. Nor could they be sure that conditions other than COVID vaccination might have accounted for the subjects’ illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, and the fact that the study was a preprint — published online without first having been vetted via peer review — the paper has been seized upon by anti-vaccination activists and the far right as confirmation that the COVID vaccines are dangerous, despite government assurances that they’re safe and effective.

After the right-wing vaccine critic Paul Thacker posted a tweet stating that the authors had posited that “millions of long COVID patients &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1892382501261172922" target="_blank"&gt;may actually be vaccine injured&lt;/a&gt;,” Iwasaki tweeted a crisp reply: “No. This is &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/VirusesImmunity/status/1892749074840850757" target="_blank"&gt;not what our study shows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that vaccine science has become poisoned with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-11/how-a-blunder-by-a-respected-medical-journal-is-fueling-an-anti-vaccine-lie"&gt;disinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-07-30/column-opposing-vaccine-mandates-trump-exposes-kids-to-disease"&gt;right-wing ideology&lt;/a&gt;. The anti-science threat only intensified when Donald Trump appointed anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/03/if-you-get-sick-its-your-fault-unless-you-got-vaccinated-in-which-case-its-the-vaccines-fault" target="_blank"&gt;a recent interview on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy responded to a burgeoning measles outbreak in West Texas — which already has brought about the first measles death of a child in the U.S. in 10 years — by promoting ineffective nostrums such as cod liver oil and steroids. He questioned the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which has been in use for more than a half-century and is known to confer &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;lifetime immunity to measles&lt;/a&gt; after two doses for the vast majority of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health, which falls under the jurisdiction of HHS, has terminated grants for research into vaccine hesitancy, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, even though the Texas measles outbreak has been attributed to low measles vaccination rates in the religious community where the outbreak began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at a Senate confirmation hearing March 5, Jay Battacharya, a Stanford professor who is Trump’s nominee to head the NIH, said he endorsed further research on the purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism, even though the link was first posited by a British study that has long been retracted and no evidence of any such link has been found despite &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism" target="_blank"&gt;decades of intensive study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement’s targeting of COVID vaccination has long been underway, even thought the vaccines were estimated by the Commonwealth Fund to have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;averted 18 million hospitalizations and 3 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in just their first two years of availability, during which 655 million doses were administered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of anti-COVID policies has led to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;laws prohibiting mass vaccinations and vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana and Texas, and a proposal mounted by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida. In eight states — Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Montana, Idaho and Washington —legislative efforts are underway to ban the mRNA COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer, the leading vaccines in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yale study’s authors defend their decision to post the preprint online even as a preliminary study of post-vaccine medical conditions. “We were aware from the outset that this is a highly politicized research topic,” co-author Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale, told me by email. “The reality is that vaccine safety — like all areas of medicine — benefits from rigorous, open research, and suppressing inquiry would be counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz added, “We were fully aware that our research could be misrepresented. That is precisely why we preprinted it — so that the full study could be read and scrutinized in context, rather than discussed based on speculation.... Suppressing studies because of concerns about how they might be misused sets a dangerous precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to the study itself, which aimed to explore what the authors termed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Their goal was to pinpoint what biological conditions might predispose some people to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some people have experienced adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines — as also happens with other shots. “Vaccines are medicines, and all medicines have side effects — even when the net benefit is large,” observes Adam Gaffney, a Harvard medical school assistant professor who has been critical of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people listed as co-authors on the Yale paper say they have experienced long-term aftereffects from COVID vaccinations. (Neither was among the subjects of the Yale study.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within an hour of receiving a COVID vaccine as a subject of an early clinical trial of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca in 2020, Brianne Dressen says she began to experience symptoms such as brain fog, neuropathy (the feeling of pain or a pins-and-needles sensation in the limbs) and food sensitivities. “I feel like I’m rolling around in cactus all the time,” she told me. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been taken off the market due to competition from vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which are more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another listed co-author, retired Southern California gastroenterologist Danice  Hertz, told me she began feeling similar reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine after it was rolled out to the public in 2021. “I walked into the facility healthy and feeling fine, and within 24 hours I became severely ill. I had severe burning in my face, tremors, twitching; I felt like I was being electrocuted.” Both say these symptoms have improved, but some haven’t fully disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both say they had trouble persuading their doctors to examine the connection between their symptoms and the shots. “It was very hard to get medical care,” Hertz says. “Nobody knew anything about these reactions. You really couldn’t get medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of finding medical treatment prompted Dressen to co-found REACT19, a tax-exempt organization that provides grants to patients and providers; Hertz is listed on its website as a research advisor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although critics have labeled REACT19 as an anti-vaccine organization, both say that’s untrue — it aims to support research into PVS. Dressen and Hertz both say they are fully vaccinated against other diseases. “We are an organization of 36,000 people, 100% vaccinated,” Dressen says. “In reality this is nothing more than a medical condition, and there should absolutely be nothing political about it. It’s been extremely abhorrent and hurtful for people suffering from chronic conditions to have their illnesses politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that leaves open the question of what the Yale study tells us. Its critics say the answer is not much. The term “post vaccination syndrome” itself is a problem, in Gaffney’s view, because it takes as a given the connection between vaccination and the symptoms. That connection needs to be proved, not assumed, he argues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By assuming the cause-and-effect relationship,” he says, “you seem to give grounding to a new medical diagnosis that may not actually be a proven cause-and-effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s especially so because the described symptoms — chronic fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, and dizziness among them — are not uncommon and often arise from other causes. Indeed, they have often been attributed to long COVID — the lasting symptoms of infection by the COVID virus itself. Not all the PVS group suffered the same symptoms, raising questions about whether PVS can be accurately defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the Yale researchers found that 26 of their PVS cohort, or about 62%, had antibodies in their system indicating that they had previously had COVID, but only 15 told the researchers that they had been infected at least once. In the control group of 22 people without symptoms, 46% had the post-infection antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other critics have argued that the sample size is simply too small to extrapolate any of the Yale findings to the population at large. Moreover, the researchers divided their samples into subgroups based on whether they had been previously infected (27 of the PVS cohort group and 11 of the control group) or uninfected (15 of the PVS sample and 11 of the control group). That arguably makes it even harder to apply the findings to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors don’t disagree that much more extensive research is needed. “This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Iwasaki told Yale’s publicity department. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.... This is far from a final answer on PVS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cautionary note may be lost on the anti-vaccine brigade that has taken the study as virtually the last word on the supposed peril of COVID vaccines. In the current partisan environment, the threat to public health from a concerted movement to undermine the public’s trust in science and vaccines is real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the Yale study sincerely see themselves as heralds of empirical science, whatever the political ramifications. “If we only published research that aligns with prevailing narratives or avoids controversy, we would be failing in our responsibility as scientists,” Krumholz told me. “Our obligation is to pursue the truth, even when it is inconvenient.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if the truth becomes not merely inconvenient, but weaponized by unscrupulous actors in a war against the public interest? Unfortunately, we may now have reached that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:00:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxONnlKekVBZ0NjaVlLQ1BHZTlzYTJmUzNzXzlfSXFXY19mek04MnJvaTl1eVRBbjMwR05zVk5PaDhRZFVqa3RsZ0ZsbHcwc2ZfYXRhSV83MFMwSWt0TXBvLWVxd0xFMXVqZWdsbXYyaVFyVExzZndjT0ljQUU0ZXZqZ3FnR0lHTktKcHNRT0xYMERMX2pVaVVoRHU5cXgzSV9zU2tXZFNteTNNaURNZUdleXNxLU5uTVR5VFpPM1ZidkwwMm5hWE9VYS04alRFWVRx</guid></item><item><title>5 years later: What it's like living with long COVID - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOQVI1T1lrS3gwbWhlUnZCVDU3WTA4MFhIb0JXTEhWS2VycVgzWWR4ZmhQdXl6cjR1Rmp0VmVJVW15dEN4UVFKWERjbWYyOXNIQTFlb3FfQ05OMzZPZzhycE1HTU9zTTRKNGUtZGsydkdhYXgtdThNZW0waG5iOWN3alJtbVpSVlBadzJGS1NFWjhJRUxpTzFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="ct:story;elm:img;itc:0;" class="stretched-box" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tagged/covid-5-years/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At a time when the world &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/vulnerable-americans-live-shadow-covid-165901780.html" data-ylk="slk:seems eager;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;seems eager&lt;/a&gt; to declare the COVID-19 pandemic a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/long-covid-problem-world-moving-on-1234988684/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:closed chapter;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;closed chapter&lt;/a&gt;, I — along with millions of other Americans — continue to confront a relentless, invisible enemy that has redefined every aspect of my existence: long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html#:~:text=Long%20COVID%20is%20a%20serious,years%20after%20COVID%2D19%20illness." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, long COVID — with more than &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/long-covid-more-200-symptoms-090037590.html" data-ylk="slk:200 symptoms;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt; — is defined as “a chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature Medicine indicates that around 400 million people globally have experienced long COVID, “which is estimated to have an annual economic impact of approximately $1 trillion — equivalent to about 1% of the global economy.” In the United States, over 29% of adults with a prior COVID-19 infection said in an August 2024 &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survey;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; that they’ve had long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s been five years since I first came down with symptoms of the coronavirus. In January 2020, before we knew much about the new virus, I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia by the National Health Service in London, where I was living at the time.

It wouldn’t be until 2021 that my doctor could officially diagnose me with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quest to get better has had its ups and downs, which I’ve documented at length for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/author/ed-hornick/" data-ylk="slk:Yahoo News;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the time, each day was a battle against exhaustion and pain as doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of my lingering illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, I am no closer to finding the answer. But I am closer to finding peace with being a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/post-covid-syndrome-the-long-haul" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-hauler;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long-hauler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The improvements I’ve experienced since 2020 are tempered by the sobering reality that I may have grown accustomed to living with a chronic illness. I often wonder if these adaptations represent true recovery or are merely a way of coping with reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like me, experts are also stumped as to the true cause, but they have a few ideas — including &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/long-covid-women-greater-risk-181100515.html" data-ylk="slk:autoimmunity;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;autoimmunity&lt;/a&gt;, chronic inflammation, viral persistence and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/588443-south-african-scientist-thinks-she-may-have/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:microclots;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;microclots&lt;/a&gt; in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The lack of a clear culprit has been a source of immense &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/long-covid-nih-recover-clinical-trials-treatment-pennsylvania-texas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frustration;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;frustration&lt;/a&gt; for patients who’ve resorted to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/long-covid-treatments-avoid-3411309" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extreme treatments;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;extreme treatments&lt;/a&gt; and holding on to hope even as uncertainty looms large.

(Courtesy of Ed Hornick)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though it was initially hard to get into these centers due to increased demand, it felt like kismet once I did. I met my people. I got the help I was looking for. I was not told “It’s all in your head” — a common refrain that long-haulers hear from uninformed doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="research"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the world was moving on from COVID-19, I was busy being a medical guinea pig. I’m currently enrolled as a subject in a long COVID research study at the renowned Johns Hopkins University, and I’ve taken part in a study by Mount Sinai looking at the effects of the illness on endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being included in these studies makes me feel seen and gives a sense that some good may come to others from my misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="pacing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the world was moving on from COVID-19, I was learning about the critical importance of pacing myself. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve experienced energy crashes, which required immediate rest followed by a long recovery. As a result, I now find myself saying “no” more often to protect my energy and set boundaries. This is no easy task for someone who cherishes time with his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author today. (Courtesy of Ed Hornick)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Italy, I also embraced “&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/from-dolce-far-niente-to-nishkriya-other-cultures-embrace-doing-nothing-what-americans-can-learn-from-them-110046496.html" data-ylk="slk:dolce far niente;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;dolce far niente&lt;/a&gt;” (the sweetness of doing nothing), which allowed me to take moments to rest, savor a healthy meal and acknowledge my physical limits without agonizing guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to these lifestyle changes, I incorporated light exercise into my routine. Walking, swimming and biking became more than just physical activities — with each step, stroke and pedal, I felt a surge of hope. They were symbols of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the world was moving on from COVID-19, I found that sharing my stories on social media sites was a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a long COVID Facebook group, strangers wrote to me with their own tales. Soon, a community developed. We shared tips, validated each other’s experiences, traded horror stories and reminded one another that we were not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, I received an outpouring of support from friends, family and important people from the past — like my sixth grade English teacher, Jennifer O’Hare, who frequently checks up on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Five years later, I stand at a proverbial crossroads. While I do feel better than I did in the earliest days of the pandemic, I’m aware that my journey is far from over. In many ways, it’s just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking forward, I am filled with cautious optimism. Research is ongoing, advocacy continues, and as patients, we must keep pushing for recognition, treatment and support. We need more clinical trials, more doctors who specialize in post-viral conditions and more understanding from society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We are not lazy. We are not making this up. We are simply trying to survive in a world that doesn’t yet know how to heal us, and that has moved on from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOQVI1T1lrS3gwbWhlUnZCVDU3WTA4MFhIb0JXTEhWS2VycVgzWWR4ZmhQdXl6cjR1Rmp0VmVJVW15dEN4UVFKWERjbWYyOXNIQTFlb3FfQ05OMzZPZzhycE1HTU9zTTRKNGUtZGsydkdhYXgtdThNZW0waG5iOWN3alJtbVpSVlBadzJGS1NFWjhJRUxpTzFB</guid></item><item><title>Diagnostic dilemma: Growing weed with bat poop left 2 men with deadly infections - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPQlNQeUVOcjk5Smh5VFk2REhpQ0RtLTVzd0YxVGNZc3hCaTBPUTNSeklTczY2X0JJa29ZQ0hJQ1ZfTnpjQ21WRnQyTllELVRGU3hTdng2M3ctN1BIeWlRUm15ck1wU2pFMDNpeTJDRUVWNFJpemZWR09VaElpMGROMWRjbl9HMlcwbjFGcG5lUFd3TUZTRDN2OTlnSFBjQlljSkdiaVhRckM1SzF6c1pzYmNIYWJpY0I4TV9qRC1pWnZCT1NNNlcwWXJaZmtxWnM5Q3hMV3Vnb2o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patients: &lt;/strong&gt;A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;computed tomography&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lungs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cause of asthma lung damage revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, patient two had a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448185/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448185/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;, which usually grows in soil and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/publicationsohpeh-factsheet-histoplasmosis.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/publicationsohpeh-factsheet-histoplasmosis.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poop of birds and bats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

However, most people exposed to the fungus &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;don't develop any symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;For example, patient one had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a common type of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Microscope image of the fungus that causes histoplasmosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: CDC/Dr. Lucille K. Georg via CDC PHIL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a report describing the cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a "natural superfood" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arizona in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New York in 2022&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" target="_blank" data-url="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ohio in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Throughout my life, I’ve been nervous about cancer and have done my best to avoid risk: I exercise often, stay out of the sun when possible, and limit processed foods. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63228993/sober-healthy-habits-strength-transformation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63228993/sober-healthy-habits-strength-transformation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Swearing off alcohol" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Swearing off alcohol&lt;/a&gt; would be just one more cancer-avoidant habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But drinking, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="even moderately" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;even moderately&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t just associated with cancer—there are many other health issues that are commonly linked with consuming alcohol, such as heart disease, liver disease, pancreatic issues, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043057/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043057/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which can contribute to chronic diseases), and brain shrinkage, says Nichole Andrews, RDN, a registered dietitian specializing in oncology.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, despite the health risks, people will largely keep drinking because they enjoy it, Andrews says. “Humans are wired for pleasure, and alcohol is deeply embedded in culture,” she adds. (After a few months of not drinking, I too began to question whether I wanted to stop drinking forever, or just be choosy about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I drank.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you’re in the same boat—and are wondering whether some alcoholic drinks are healthier than others—keep reading to find out how to drink with your health in mind, and the healthiest (and least healthy) bevs to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-drink-with-your-overall-health-in-mind" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Drink With Your Overall Health In Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Even small amounts of alcohol can increase your risk of cancer, which is why Bragagnini encourages her patients not to drink—or do so as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you choose to consume alcohol, there are ways to mitigate risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="8" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for percent of alcohol by volume (ABV).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="9" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Alcohol breaks down in the body into acetaldehyde, a carcinogen, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcohol-metabolism" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcohol-metabolism" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Acetaldehyde has been shown to contribute to at least seven forms of cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. Department of Health and Human Services" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) So, if you’re drinking alcohol, consuming this carcinogen is unavoidable. And when it comes to cancer risk, no type of alcohol has been proven to be safer than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, the risk is higher in drinks with a larger percent of alcohol by volume (ABV), says Eleonora Teplinsky, MD, a board-certified medical oncologist specializing in breast and gynecologic oncology. This isn’t to say that a shot of liquor is worse than a glass of wine—Dr. Teplinsky says that each &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/what-standard-drink" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/what-standard-drink" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="standard serving of alcohol" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;standard serving of alcohol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (12 fluid ounces of beer at five percent ABV, five fluid ounces of wine at 12 percent ABV, and 1.5 fluid ounces of liquor at 40 percent ABV) carries equal cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But it’s important to note that not all &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63788221/glp1-alcohol-use-disorder-clinical-trial-results/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63788221/glp1-alcohol-use-disorder-clinical-trial-results/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="alcohols" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;alcohols&lt;/a&gt; abide by these ABV standards—some beers, wines, and specialty drinks can have higher (or lower) percentages. For instance, “if you’re consuming 12 ounces of beer with 10 percent alcohol content, that is going to be equivalent to two five-percent beers,” says Dr. Teplinsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, you may be having one drink, thinking you're sticking to the recommended limit, but you’re effectively having double. That’s why “paying attention to the alcohol content is very important when thinking about cancer risk,” Dr. Teplinsky says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABV isn’t the only thing you need to look out for.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re at a restaurant or bar, it’s important to consider whether or not you’re being served the correct &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt;, says Wendy Kaplan, RDN, a registered dietitian and board-certified specialist in oncology nutrition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She urges drinkers to ask themselves: &lt;em&gt;How heavy is this waiter’s pour? Is this five ounces of wine or am I really getting nine ounces?&lt;/em&gt; (You can even ask the waiter themselves if their pour technically counts as one serving—or more.) The same goes for when you’re pouring yourself a glass at home. “If your glass seems larger than expected, you don’t have to finish it. Being aware of your serving helps you make mindful choices,” Kaplan says.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go for lower-calorie drinks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="17" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you’re going to drink, choose low-calorie beverages—such as light beers, a glass of wine, or hard seltzer—and avoid high-calorie options with lots of sugary mixers, says Lizzy Swick, RDN, a registered dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Any beverage with fewer calories, just like any &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="food with fewer calories" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;food with fewer calories&lt;/a&gt;, is ultimately better for weight management,” she says, noting that being overweight can be a key contributor to many of the same conditions connected to alcohol intake, including cancer, heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less is more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="21" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The standard for "moderate" drinking is one drink per day for women, but “this isn’t a goal—it’s an upper limit. The less, the better,” says Andrews. If you’re going to drink at all, though, Swick recommends striving for “light drinking” (one to four drinks per week), rather than moderate drinking. Indeed, a 2017 study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912140/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912140/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cancer Research and Treatment" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cancer Research and Treatment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that compared to moderate drinking, “light drinking” and “very light drinking” were associated with fewer instances of most types of common cancers (though this is not the case for breast cancer in women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;No drinking is safe, but heavy drinking (eight or more drinks for women per week) and binge drinking (four or more drinks for women in &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/binge-drinking" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/binge-drinking" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="about two hours" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about two hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) pose the most threat to one’s health, says Swick.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make substitutions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="25" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For those looking to limit or cut their alcohol intake, Swick recommends asking oneself why having a drink is important to you. If you love having a glass of wine at night to relax, consider whether it’s really the wine that you like, or if it’s taking a pause in your day. If it’s the latter, replace that wine with a nice cup of tea or a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g37116723/best-mocktail-recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g37116723/best-mocktail-recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fun, fizzy mocktail" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;fun, fizzy mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, Swick says. She’s found that many of her female clients, especially those who are moms, “don’t really care about the alcohol as much as having the ‘me time’ carved out,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-alcoholic-drinks-are-better-than-others" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Alcoholic Drinks Are Better Than Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Curious about which drinks may be “lesser evils”? While all alcohol poses health risks, experts say these drinks might be less problematic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Light Beer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="31" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Light beer is known to have a low amount of alcohol per drink—some light beers have 4.2 percent ABV, while regular beer typically has five percent ABV and some craft beers have 10 percent ABV, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/what-standard-drink" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/what-standard-drink" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, light beer is a low-calorie drink, and which can help with weight management, as unnecessary &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63485594/prevent-perimenopause-weight-gain/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63485594/prevent-perimenopause-weight-gain/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight gain" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; can be a contributing factor to many illnesses, Andrews says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sangria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="34" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;One of the main ingredients in sangria is &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63917947/orange-citrus-depression-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63917947/orange-citrus-depression-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fruit" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;, such as chopped oranges, peaches, pineapple, nectarines, pears, and apples. These are a great addition as fruit contains antioxidants which can help reduce risk of age-linked chronic issues like cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/11/1123?utm_campaign=CHD_arte-supremo-lx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/11/1123?utm_campaign=CHD_arte-supremo-lx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Antioxidants" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, antioxidants can be reduced as a result of consuming ethanol, a type of alcohol, and this can lead to nutrients not being absorbed in your system as well, per 2023 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10096942/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10096942/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrients" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Fruit is also a good source of fiber, which may also protect against cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and diabetes, per 2023 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268005X23000413" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268005X23000413" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Food Hydrocolloids" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Food Hydrocolloids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Plus, citrus fruit juices (particularly orange juice) contains vitamin C and folate, which can help with the immune system and inflammation, according to a 2021 study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#s6" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#s6" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frontiers in Immunology" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, these added nutrients aren’t a free pass to down a ton of sangria. It’s great to add more fruit into one’s diet but the benefits found in the cocktail “aren’t in concentrations high enough to counter the ill effects of the alcohol,” Swick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="39" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fresh Fruit Margaritas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="40" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Fruit has valuable health benefits, but it’s extra beneficial if it takes the place of sugary mixes in a drink, Andrews says. So, if you’re making margaritas, instead of buying a pre-made mix, grab some fresh lime, strawberries, or whatever fruit you like in your margarita, to add to your blender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Of course, it can be hard to tell how the bartender at a restaurant makes their margaritas (with fresh fruit or lots of sugary mix), so margaritas might be a smart drink to save for home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="43" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Dry Wines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="44" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It’s not just mixers and syrups that make a drink sugary—sometimes it’s the alcohol itself. And when it comes to wine, sugar content varies greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=National+Standard+for+Wines_Beijing_China+-+Peoples+Republic+of_05-23-2006.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=National+Standard+for+Wines_Beijing_China+-+Peoples+Republic+of_05-23-2006.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USDA defines" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USDA defines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dry wines as those with sugar content under nine grams per liter (equivalent to 1.33 bottles)—with some dry varieties having less than one gram per liter. Popular dry wines include Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Meanwhile, semi-dry wines, semi-sweet wines, and sweet wines can have much more sugar, with sweet wines (like Moscato and White Zinfandel) being defined as having a sugar content over 45 grams per liter. To put that in perspective, the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Heart Association" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends women limit their added sugar intake to 25 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="48" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Bloody Mary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="49" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;When it comes to mixers, the Bloody Mary has a pretty decent one, health-wise: Tomato juice is packed with antioxidants like lycopene, has many benefits, including helping to fight inflammation, obesity, and diabetes, per a 2024 study in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/6252426" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/6252426" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Drop in some celery—which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-hypertension, and neuroprotective properties, per 2022 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498075/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498075/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Foods" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and this boozy drink looks way more nutritious than your average cocktail. But just like with a sangria, people shouldn’t take the healthy ingredients as a sign to over-indulge in these drinks. “Let’s be real—it’s still alcohol,” Andrews says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="54" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Wine Spritzer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="55" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="56" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This light, summery drink mixes white wine with sparkling water. While Andrews may prefer her patients stick with sparkling water on its own, she acknowledges that combining alcohol with water could help reduce alcohol consumption while also providing hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="57" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Hot Toddy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="58" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="59" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;A Hot Toddy is typically made with a spirit like whisky—plus lemon, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34713804/honey-for-cough/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34713804/honey-for-cough/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="honey" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt;, and hot water. If you’re feeling under the weather, the non-alcoholic ingredients in this warm drink can indeed help make you feel better when you catch a cold. Honey can improve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, per a 2021 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817011/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817011/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BMJ" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMJ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And lemons can protect against diseases, like cardiovascular disease, and also have anticancer effects, according to 2023 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745609/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745609/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrients" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, water will help with hydration—key if you’re feeling unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="61" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But it’s important to note that, if you’re trying to recover from an illness, the alcohol in a Hot Toddy is counter-productive. Drinking a lot can prevent your body from being able to ward off infections as well, and can weaken your immune system, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="62" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you’re in the mood for a warm beverage (and you’re not feeling sick), simple mixers make the Hot Toddy a good alternative to other hot alcoholic drinks—like boozy hot coco and Irish coffee—which may contain a lot of sugar and calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="63" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Mojito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="64" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="65" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Mojitos typically contain rum, mint, lime, sugar, and soda water. And while simply drinking water flavored with mint and lime would be ideal for your health, these cocktails can serve as a nice alternative to sugary beachy drinks like Piña Coladas. Plus, it’s worth noting that limes have potential neuroprotective effects, according to 2023 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9914248/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9914248/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Foods" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and mint may help with inflammation, according to a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37850332/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37850332/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Phytotherapy Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Phytotherapy Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="66" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The Mojito is also another drink that dilutes alcohol with water, so if you’re making your own drink, it’s easy to include more water, and less rum, in your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-worst-alcoholic-drinks-for-my-health" data-node-id="67" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the worst alcoholic drinks for my health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="68" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While some alcoholic drinks may be seen as lesser evils—there are other beverages that experts say should be avoided completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="69" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Sugar And High-Fat Drinks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="70" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="71" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Bragagnini warns that drinks made in a blender, like Piña Coladas, Daiquiris, and Margaritas, created with commercialized mixers and syrups, could be calorie-laden and contain increased amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a34730203/clean-eating-no-added-sugar-diet-weight-loss-success-story/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a34730203/clean-eating-no-added-sugar-diet-weight-loss-success-story/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="added sugar" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;. “Consuming these frequently may lead to unwanted weight gain and spikes in blood sugar,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="72" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Andrews notes that the same goes for cream-based drinks like boozy milkshakes and White Russians, which are known to be “high in sugar, fat, and alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="73" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Mixed Drinks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="74" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="75" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Bragagnini advises against ordering cocktails made with multiple types of hard liquor, like Long Island iced teas, Mai Tais, and Negronis. These usually have a high alcohol content and are loaded with calories. She also notes that drinks with multiple servings of alcohol can carry worrisome short-term risks, such as alcohol poisoning and inebriation-related injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="76" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Kaplan adds that mixed drinks can be risky because a restaurant menu won’t typically tell how much of each alcohol is going into a beverage—and what ABV those drinks contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="77" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Many Glasses Of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="78" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="79" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;When it comes to your overall health, the &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; of drinks consumed is more important than the type, Bragagnini says. Your best bet? She suggests choosing just one drink that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, rather than ordering round after round of a drink you think might be “healthier.” So, having one sugary strawberry daiquiri would likely be a better choice than consuming seven low-calorie sangrias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="80" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While some drinks may be better or worse than others, Kaplan reiterates that there is no safe level of alcohol. But this doesn’t mean that everyone who drinks will get cancer, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="82" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are some foods—and drinks—that we want to limit, but that doesn’t mean we should go through life never having a little treat, says Kaplan. It’s important to do things that bring us joy, she says, and if that means enjoying a drink with friends every so often, so be it. For many, it’s just about finding balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="83" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://theoncologydietitian.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://theoncologydietitian.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nichole Andrews" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nichole Andrews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, is a registered dietitian specializing in oncology at her practice The Oncology Dietitian in Tri-Cities, Washington. &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/amy-bragagnini" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/amy-bragagnini" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Bragagnini" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Bragagnini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RD, is a clinical oncology dietitian at Trinity Health Lacks Cancer Center in Grand Rapids, MI, and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. &lt;a href="https://interludecancerstories.com/about-dr-teplinsky/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linktree&amp;amp;utm_campaign=about+dr.+teplinsky" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://interludecancerstories.com/about-dr-teplinsky/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linktree&amp;amp;utm_campaign=about+dr.+teplinsky" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eleonora Teplinsky" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eleonora Teplinsky&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a board-certified medical oncologist specializing in breast and gynecologic oncology and the Head of Breast and Gynecologic Medical Oncology at Valley-Mount Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Care in Paramus, NJ. &lt;a href="https://food4healthrd.com/about-2/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://food4healthrd.com/about-2/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wendy Kaplan" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wendy Kaplan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, is a registered dietitian and board-certified specialist in oncology nutrition based in New York. &lt;a href="https://lizzyswicknutrition.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://lizzyswicknutrition.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lizzy Swick" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lizzy Swick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, is a registered dietitian based in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Women's Health Malaysia</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNNGd5SjBSVEpoSnltSllpR1NVSXlReUlxQ2tTd1ZoakhNMmUxRHd4cEYwVVhHaTc2QjdEQzRjVHdyVDFnZEJlM3pSakpFX0t3Q3ZNYjVlcU5QMmVnRWxJdENrMV94Y2llakNYb0NibTN3eE1keFdPWDlRYk9Oc1dBZERiQ2pOZU1hcGVTSlI1X0VEa3ZuYzlQVTN3R1dRVXM4TGxwemJDandQLXRxZ2RFOGxvZlJBQzJxZXpEUW5fdXlVT3ItYkVkQUlB</guid></item><item><title>5 years since the pandemic started, long COVID patients are still hoping for a cure - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUkl3UHg2YjNzY0tQRU4waUI2MXJObThCak9hcHVKSUtLZmR4VkFhWlM3RkJGM19sa2wwLWpvUjBfWkdweUNyUXRVeHc3ZWo4RlBTM0hHZDRGYVgyYlQ1R1VKZW5vSkFBUjctZDVRWHdoX3lyNlVMZnpJek1CNkxpblkyYmNFNGtVWFBBN0k0SjQzbVd1ek1FNlBnQ1FUTnVSX1k2YVVCcl84MDgtZ3FMdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Long COVID patients haven't stopped pushing for more research funding to find treatments for their condition, including this protest in Washington, D.C. in 2022.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's been five years since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. But many patients with long COVID have yet to find meaningful recovery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Around 6% of adults in the U.S. —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or roughly 18 million — are estimated to be living with the damaging aftermath of catching the virus, according to research and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank"&gt;long-running survey&lt;/a&gt; of U.S households, although numbers are still difficult to pin down because the definitions vary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not a thing of the past — new patients are still showing up in doctor's offices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions," says &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/covid19-patient-led-research-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Davis,&lt;/a&gt; co-founder of the advocacy group, Patient-Led Research Collaborative,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've seen so much long COVID in just the last year or two."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research on long COVID has coalesced around a handful of explanations for what could underpin the illness, but that hasn't yet translated into major breakthroughs for patients who need care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are still no approved treatments for the condition, which can span many organ systems and symptoms depending on the patient, and can include shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue and post-exertional malaise, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, long COVID patients had pushed &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5199994/long-covid-patients-nih-research-treatments" target="_blank"&gt;for more federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and a refocus of research priorities toward treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, patient advocates and scientists have to make their case to new decision-makers, guided by the priorities of the Trump administration — and do so at a moment of turbulence for biomedical sciences with funding imperiled for many institutions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Regardless of party or political position, long COVID patients have been failed to date by our leaders," says &lt;a href="https://x.com/meighanstone?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;Meighan Stone&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, who's busy lobbying the new administration and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone acknowledges there are certainly some "heartfelt disagreements," between the patient community and Trump's picks to lead federal health agencies, particularly on policies related to curbing the spread of the virus, but she argues patients need to find places where there's common ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don't have the luxury of sitting out the next four years over any ideological differences.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Slow progress in research, but promising new trials &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many patients, the day-to-day reality has not changed dramatically. Finding clinicians who are well-versed in the nuances of long COVID remains challenging, patients say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach to care generally focuses on relieving specific symptoms and related medical conditions that someone develops such as autoimmunity or POTS, says &lt;a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/gutierrezm19" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez,&lt;/a&gt; chair of rehabilitation medicine at UT Health Science Center San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It is a lot of symptom management right now," she says. "We need significant treatment trials so patients have the possibility of getting a cure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though progress has not come nearly fast enough, those involved in long COVID research emphasize there's reason for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, Davis notes scientists have published important work&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07873-4" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;in a variety of areas — on blood clotting, the impacts of exercise, evidence of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk3295" target="_blank"&gt;viral persistence&lt;/a&gt; in the spinal cord, and loss of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036752" target="_blank"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the brain, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With this research in hand, the field is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;now ripe&lt;/a&gt; for a broader push to test different therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When trials launched a couple of years ago, there was hope that it would be easy and we would just hit a home run," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/michael.peluso" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Michael Peluso&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a large research program on long COVID at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first round of trials that have been reported out have shown this is going to be more complicated — we all sort of expected that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By Peluso's estimation, there are currently in the neighborhood of 50 drug trials underway for long COVID, a considerable increase from a few years ago when he only counted about a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have drugs that can target almost every single one of the different mechanisms that we think might be contributing to long COVID, but so far we've launched way too few trials" to thoroughly test them, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To get there will require more participation from drugmakers, which have largely stayed on the sidelines. Plus, researchers want to identify a biomarker for the illness that can be reliably tracked across multiple trials; and they say a better coordinated clinical trial agenda is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Different theories on long COVID's cause&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Viral persistence — the theory that an ongoing infection is hiding out in the body — has featured prominently in some of the early trials, which have leveraged antivirals and monoclonal antibodies in hopes of extinguishing an ongoing infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At least half a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; may also drive the illness, though.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among them: Immune dysfunction, the reactivation of dormant viruses like herpes, dysregulation of clotting proteins, and trouble with the microbiome. All of these could be equally, if not more important as viral persistence, and have received less attention in clinical trials up to this point, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Davis is closely following a number of up-and-running trials, led by individual research groups and universities, which are testing immunomodulators, HIV drugs, rapamycin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), enzymes called nattokinase and lumbrokinase, and other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Private funders &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1229724579/scientists-rely-on-private-funding-to-push-long-covid-research-forward" target="_blank"&gt;have stepped&lt;/a&gt; up to back some of these efforts. For example, the non-profit PolyBio Research Foundation has raised millions of dollars to spearhead &lt;a href="https://polybio.org/consortium-project-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;some of its trials&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government, however, remains pivotal in guiding the broader long COVID agenda, given its role in funding research and eventually greenlighting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Through the RECOVER initiative, Congress has already poured more than $1 billion into this work and last year appropriated an &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/nih-adds-funds-long-covid-research-advances-work-new-clinical-trials" target="_blank"&gt;additional $662 million&lt;/a&gt; to be spent in the coming years. About half of that money is supposed to support clinical trials, led by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new lobbying push from patients&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring these studies — and the funding for them — continue is the number one priority right now, says Stone of the Long COVID campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With upheaval across federal health agencies and science funding in doubt, it's hard to know what's in store for an emerging field of research like long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;It's going to take a different type of strategy than we have been doing for the last four years," says Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/05/g-s1-51401/nih-director-bhattacharya-nominee" target="_blank"&gt;the nominee to lead the NIH,&lt;/a&gt; both explicitly pledged to support long COVID research during their Senate confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone says Kennedy's focus on chronic diseases — and specifically the president's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again Commission&lt;/a&gt; — could be an opportunity for long COVID patients and those suffering from infection-associated chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Kennedy has indicated he'd like to deprioritize research on infectious diseases and even petitioned to have federal regulators pull the COVID-19 vaccine off the market in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy and Bhattacharya have also heavily criticized measures aimed at mitigating COVID transmission. But many in the long COVID community &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Letter-to-President-Biden-on-Long-COVID-Funding.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;are frustrated&lt;/a&gt; that the ongoing spread of the virus has been normalized and point out that reinfections still carry a risk for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After taking office, President Trump was quick to disband a long COVID advisory committee that took months to stand-up. That came as a disappointment to Verduzco-Gutierrez, who was a member. But she says it doesn't stop any of the work that she and others on the committee will be doing, alongside advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone managed to get a moment in the hallway with Bhattacharya after his confirmation hearing earlier this month and says he reiterated to her that he's serious about long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Patients should take Secretary Kennedy and take Dr. Bhattacharya at their word, and if the administration doesn't meet the patient community in that, then we will keep calling for action the same way that we did under President Biden," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

Should we start to consider a life without these delicious sources of fat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the most recent stories come from a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="published in JAMA" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; which looks at butter and plant based oils intake and mortality. According to the study, higher butter intake was associated with increased total and cancer mortality, while higher intake of plant-based oils was associated with lower total, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically: plant-based oils such as olive oils are much better for your body than saturated fats such as butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the experts require a little more nuance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t go chucking out the golden goodness in your fridge just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Sarah Berry, Professor of Nutritional Sciences, &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="King’s College London" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;King’s College London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-butter-or-vegetable-oils-and-mortality/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-butter-or-vegetable-oils-and-mortality/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “This research is very timely.

It is positive to see other plant oils being considered in this way as olive oil has been a focus of much research in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The suggestion to switch from butter to plant oils is achievable for many people. However, it was only olive oil that was associated with a lower risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, including &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/stroke/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stroke" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/stroke/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.

This is potentially something which could be considered in future studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.

Off the top of my head, here's a few deceptively big ones:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) We still aren't exactly sure how anesthesia works. We just know it causes certain effects, and they are useful so we use it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) psychiatry is still shockingly infantile in our understanding of human disorders. It's constantly in a state of flux, we don't understand a lot about the meds we currently use, and the diagnostic criteria for disorders still changes as we realize "hey maybe all these behaviors aren't the same source disorder". It's incredibly hard to diagnose when the criteria is largely based on self report and subjective observations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) To a lesser degree than #2, neurology is still learning a lot. It's further because you can observe more objective findings in neuro than psych, but we still struggle a lot with how brains function. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Immunology. Don't even ask me, because no one knows really. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) yawns. Still guessing on why that happens too. There's some theories, but that's the best we got.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgxfkc7/" target="_blank"&gt; YoungSerious &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-wearing-blue-scrub-suit-and-mask-sitting-on-bench-3279197/" target="_blank"&gt; Jonathan Borba/Unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331080"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331080" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/things-people-dont-know-human-body-29-67d00b6ca7d80__700.jpg" alt="A person with dreadlocks lying in bed, contemplating unknown aspects of the human body." title="A person with dreadlocks lying in bed, contemplating unknown aspects of the human body."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;What causes endometriosis and how do you treat it effectively. The leading theory is “retrograde menstruation,” which occurs in 80-90% of women. Ok….. so why do 80-90% of women not have endometriosis?

We don’t know what is supposed to naturally bind to the area that benzodiazepines work at. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benzodiazepines, BZD, are medications like Xanax and Valium. They produce anti-anxiety effects. And they have a very distinct chemical shape to fit into the BZD site in a group of five proteins. But we don’t know what is supposed to go there. Many medications are analogs of naturally binding molecules that we copy and then use to create an effect.

They are made of 78 copies of a protein called the major vault protein, totalling about three times the size of a ribosome, and larger than most viruses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their function is not totally understood, but it's probably something to do with the nucleus, though analogs of the genes for vaults even appear in bacteria. As they are found in such a wide variety of species, life on Earth must have started making vaults early in its history. The similarity of the genes encoding vault proteins across diverse species would presumably indicate the importance of vaults for viable life, but experiments haven't shown a great deal of harm done to lab animals that had their vault genes knocked out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even stranger, several of the species used in laboratories as model organisms naturally lack vaults.

I would wake up with a raging headache at 4am and barf 2-3 times an hour until 2pm, twice a month. I couldn't eat, drink, take medicine, drive, talk, watch TV, or think. I would spend the day alternating between the bathroom floor or in bed hallucinating from the pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got a daith piercing nearly 4 years ago and it changed my whole life. I can count on one hand the number of times a headache has made me barf since getting the piercing. If I wake up with one, I maybe get sick once, take an extra strength Tylenol, and lie down for an hour, and it's like I never had anything wrong to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit 2: I feel like migraines are one of the most polarizing health issues.

But I've spent a lot of time in doctors offices. There's a lot of s**t wrong with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. I have an illness called idiopathic intracranial hypertension the idiopathic means they don't know why the f**k it happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I got it right after I got the Mirena IUD. It turned out a lot of people get it right after they got the Mirena IUD. Enough for a class action law suit it be filed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It got tossed immediatly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, Mirena has listed in the side effects it could cause a stroke, sure, but effect csf? Absolutely not. Not a side effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's my thing. If I go to my gyno right after I get birth control, and say 'hey, I've had a nonstop headache and Im concerned.' they shouldn't wave it off and say it's normal. They should remove it and send you to a neuro to check for a stroke or csf issue, cause it's a possible side effect. But they don't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And neuros deny birth control could be an iih factor cause IT'S NOT LISTED IN THE OFFICIAL SIDE EFFECTS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I got my thyroid removed years and years ago. I'd been on a stable dosage of levothyroxine for like, 6 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get the Mirena, the csf vein in my brain collapses, and all of a sudden my tsh levels go banana balls. Its like, 7. It had been 1, so, I am no longer absorbing my levothyroxine correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My neuro tells me to keep in the Mirena, my endo tells me the Mirena and the iih can't effect the levo absorption, and I'm just... Dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the year we keep adjusting the levo, and my tsh just is not playing ball. It's just ping ponging wildly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year after this all starts I just take the Mirena out, against gyno and neuros recommendations. The pain of my neverending headache decreases SIGNIFICANTLY. My tsh levels finally go back to normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my doctors just shrug. Oh, what a coincidence. It wasn't the Mirena though. It can't do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also. When my brain collapsed, I suddenly became intolerant to A LOT of foods. But according to the allergist that doesn't happen. You don't suddenly become allergic to basically everything. She kicked me out. I basically eat the mcas+oral allergy syndrome diet now but honestly help would be good. Brain damage couldn't cause massive food intolerances? Wtf? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also spent two years just... Passing out over and over again every day from the sheer agony of it all. After I finally got neuro surgery I couldn't fall asleep naturally any more. No pain, no sleep. I went to a sleep specialist and he was like 'pain keeps you awake it doesn't put you to sleep. You aren't special'. I don't think they've researched people stuck in a neverending migraine for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with doctors is hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: bonus. I live in Boston. All my doctors were supposed to be at the top of their field. Big wigs. Muckity mucks. Professors at Harvard or tufts or BU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phffffffffff.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgz9huw/" target="_blank"&gt; biddily &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-88/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331047"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331047" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Mental health professional rather than MD, but we still don't know much about the mechanisms of schizophrenia or bipolar.

We don’t know what those “things” specifically are, but there are a lot of indicators it does something big!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**The Claustrum!**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theory goes, it’s the part of the brain responsible for actual consciousness!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…but back to the ADHD part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2-5% of people have ADHD. If you’re on social media you can tell it’s a lot of people…! Additionally the leading causes of death for people with ADHD are s*****e and murder. That’s right, if you have ADHD, you are more likely to die of s*****e *or* murder than to live to old age… yes. If you have ADHD you literally have an actual disorder that means you’ll either off yourself or get&lt;br&gt; killed by someone else….but I digress….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we do know, the Claustrum, lights up with greater activity with people who have ADHD. We know when the Claustrum is inhibited in rats, they kind of just do…whatever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one day we understand the Claustrum better, and it turns out that is responsible for ADHD.. that would mean the general public could finally come to understand — especially the parents of ADHD kids (who are significantly more likely to abuse their ADHD children)… that they’re actually mistreating their kids because of a health issue more closely related to *Epilepsy* than just “lack of discipline” or “behavioral problems”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That shift in thinking would save lives. I hope the purpose of the Claustrum is clearly identified and understood one day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It also might mean people with ADHD may experience human consciousness very differently, too… and that’s where it gets *really* interesting.).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgzsm8d/" target="_blank"&gt; obvusthrowawayobv &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-66/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331039"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331039" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

This just comes first to mind.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgy6t2a/" target="_blank"&gt; Tittyboy_mcgee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331045"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331045" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Another, how babies/young children assimilate so much information so quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It cannot (as far as I know) be replicated by a computer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgx7jh7/" target="_blank"&gt; stuntedmonk &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331056"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331056" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor, but this was posted a few years ago when the same question was asked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We still aren't sure what causes precordial catch syndrome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reddit is where I finally put a name to the sporadic chest pain I had in my teens/20s that goes away when you take a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgygr8j/" target="_blank"&gt; VulturE &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-43/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331064"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331064" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor but I always find it wild how unsophisticated a lot of surgery is.

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prescriptions for drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have increased 18% each year since the Covid pandemic, a new study has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Research from experts at the University of Huddersfield and Aston University suggested there was an upward trend in prescriptions for the condition in each region across England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This could be due to increasing awareness of ADHD via social media, encouranging more people to seek diagnosis and treatment, the project found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, experts warned that "misinformation on these platforms may lead to misconceptions about symptoms, diagnosis and treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A second reason behind the rise in prescriptions could be the "strong association between the impact of the (Covid) pandemic and the worsening of ADHD symptoms," researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study, which was published in the journal BMJ Mental Health, calculated that prescriptions in England "increased significantly" from 25.17 items per 1,000 population in 2019/20 (before Covid) to 41.55 items in 2023/24, with an average annual increase of 18% nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;English prescribing data was used for the five currently licensed ADHD drugs at national, regional, and NHS integrated care board (ICB) levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Those drugs are the stimulants methylphenidate - such as Ritalin, Concerta and Delmosart - dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine and two non-stimulants - atomoxetine and guanfacine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2

methylphenidate remained the most-prescribed medication while lisdexamfetamine showed the highest growth rate (55% annually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It said there was an upwards trend, but there were variations across the regions with "an average yearly increase ranging from 13% in the North East and Yorkshire region to 28% in the London region". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The experts said use of ADHD medicines in children and adults was supported by "substantial evidence", including that they improved quality of life and ability, and cut substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People with ADHD are known to suffer inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and may struggle to concentrate on a given task, or suffer extreme fidgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Ulrich Muller-Sedgwick, ADHD champion at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said people with the condition need access to timely and effective assessment, "followed by the appropriate treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The right diagnosis and care, including medication and reasonable adjustments, can greatly benefit people's health and support them to reach their full potential at school, university or work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We know that expanding ADHD services through targeted investment would help ensure people receive the vital care they need," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

is a type of dopamine agonist, which is commonly given to patients in the UK with neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Its side

drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the four years while he was taking Ropinirole he said he found himself using gambling websites in the early hours of the morning and he spent all of his and his wife's savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We had another house that we owned, that we rented out, and that was part of our pension plan but we had to sell it to get money back in the bank again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Along with the gambling, Mr Stevens also engaged in uncontrollable spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In a short period, I spent £6,500 on fishing equipment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"None of it seemed wrong, that's the craziness of it,

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said it was not until he applied to take part in an MS drug trial that he realised something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said a consultant during the trial told him to stop taking Ropinirole  "immediately".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he researched the drug online and found other cases where people had struggled with addiction linked to dopamine agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Angharad Vaughan, a solicitor with Leigh Day, represented Mr Stevens when he took legal action against his GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the first case like this which she settled was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My hope is that these cases will shine a light on the issue and patient safety will improve as a result," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he was not aware how much he had spent until he went through his accounts with Ms Vaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I just cried my eyes out, I just could not believe what I had done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

independently as a GP in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Restless leg syndrome will specifically be included in the updated GP curriculum, due to take effect from August 2025," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Phil Stevens, from Hampshire, said he developed an addiction to gambling and spending after taking prescription medication for restless leg syndrome (RLS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The 66-year-old has said he is now reluctant to take anything for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He claimed his GP

is a type of dopamine agonist, which is commonly given to patients in the UK with neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Its side

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Speaking from the home he shares with his wife in Ringwood, Mr Stevens admitted he did occasionally bet before he took the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the four years while he was taking Ropinirole he said he found himself using gambling websites in the early hours of the morning and he spent all of his and his wife's savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We had another house that we owned, that we rented out, and that was part of our pension plan but we had to sell it to get money back in the bank again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Along with the gambling, Mr Stevens also engaged in uncontrollable spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In a short period, I spent £6,500 on fishing equipment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"None of it seemed wrong, that's the craziness of it,

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said it was not until he applied to take part in an MS drug trial that he realised something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said a consultant during the trial told him to stop taking Ropinirole  "immediately".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he researched the drug online and found other cases where people had struggled with addiction linked to dopamine agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Angharad Vaughan, a solicitor with Leigh Day, represented Mr Stevens when he took legal action against his GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the first case like this which she settled was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My hope is that these cases will shine a light on the issue and patient safety will improve as a result," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he was not aware how much he had spent until he went through his accounts with Ms Vaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I just cried my eyes out, I just could not believe what I had done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

independently as a GP in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Restless leg syndrome will specifically be included in the updated GP curriculum, due to take effect from August 2025," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

	&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles continues to spread in West Texas and New Mexico, with more than 250 people infected — many unvaccinated school-age children. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Two cases in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, for which state officials have not provided a location, have also been linked to these outbreaks. Eleven other states have reported isolated measles cases, typically linked to  international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Measles cases by county in 2025&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Isolated cases   &lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Outbreaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: State health departments; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Note: Reported measles cases as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in late January,  when local health officials reported two cases in Gaines County, a rural agricultural area on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The outbreak quickly escalated. Measles has spread into neighboring counties and infected at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; as of Tuesday, including 29 people who have been hospitalized and an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;unvaccinated young child who died&lt;/a&gt;, the first such death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;New Mexico also &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;declared an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. While the cases in New Mexico have not officially been connected to the Texas outbreak, officials have said they are “undoubtedly related.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz "&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Reported measles cases for Texas and New Mexico counties as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Last week, an unvaccinated resident of Lea County who &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/health/measles-death-new-mexico.html"&gt;tested positive for the virus died&lt;/a&gt;, though officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In both states, most measles cases have spread among people who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For years, Gaines County has had low childhood vaccination rates, largely because of the area’s large Mennonite community. While there is no religious doctrine that explicitly forbids vaccines, the insular Christian group has historically avoided interacting with the health care system and has a long tradition of using home remedies and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Roughly 82 percent of the kindergarten students in the county had received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, or M.M.R., last year, which is far below the 95 percent coverage needed to prevent outbreaks in a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Texas public schools require children to have received certain vaccines, including the M.M.R. shot, but parents can apply for an exemption for “reasons of conscience,” including religious beliefs. Last year, Gaines County had one of the highest exemption rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Vaccination rates can vary widely by school district. The Loop Independent School District in Gaines County is a small district with one school and the lowest rate of measles vaccination in the affected Texas counties. Only 46 percent of kindergarten students had received their M.M.R. vaccine in the 2023 school year, down from 82 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Change in measles vaccination rates in affected Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;By county, for public school districts and private schools, since 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Chart shows the change in reported vaccination rates among kindergarten students in public school districts and private schools from 2019–20 to 2023–24. Homeschooled children are not included in this data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In Lea County, N.M., the M.M.R. vaccination rate for children and teens is relatively high, at about 94 percent. But the rate among adults is much lower: 63 percent have received one shot of M.M.R., and only 55 percent have received both shots, according to local health officials, though they noted that there may be vaccinated adults whose records have not been added to the system. Adults make up more than half of reported cases in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known infections. In a hypothetical community where nobody had immunity from the virus and each infected person infected 18 others, a small outbreak would quickly grow out of control:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Every vaccinated person would help slow the spread of the virus and limit the outbreak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For the outbreak to end quickly, each infected person would need to infect fewer than one other person, on average. In this example, 17 of 18 people would need to be vaccinated — more than 94 percent of the community:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;And while measles symptoms often resolve on their own within a few weeks, the virus can be extremely dangerous in rare cases. It may cause pneumonia, making it difficult for children to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The virus also causes “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” making the body unable to defend itself against illnesses it has already been exposed to and leaving patients more susceptible to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Once someone is infected with the virus, doctors have little control over how serious a measles infection becomes — there is no antiviral for measles to stop its spread in the body, only “supportive care” to help manage symptoms. That’s why experts recommend that people get two doses of the M.M.R. vaccine, which are 97 percent effective at preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles was officially declared eliminated — which means the virus is not continually spreading — in 2000, in large part because of aggressive vaccination campaigns. Experts now fear that status may be at risk, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;childhood vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; have been falling nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
