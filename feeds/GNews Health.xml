As a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a39028150/my-diagnosis-type-1-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetic&lt;/a&gt;, so much of what I eat affects my day-to-day life. Anything from an apple to a donut can send my blood sugar into a frenzy. This led me to wonder what happens to your body when you eat blueberries every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of NutritionStarringYOU.com and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Easy-Pre-Diabetes-Cookbook-Healthy/dp/1507216556/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64542223%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauded for their low glycemic index and high antioxidant count, the delicious blue spheres make for a tasty ingredient in muffins, blended into smoothies, adorning a yogurt bowl, and much more. So, I added about a cup to my routine for over two weeks (eating them straight up, on their own as a snack) to see if I reaped the many purported benefits—of which there seem to be many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also emerging research on the role of blueberries in gut health and exercise recovery,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of NutritionStarringYOU.com and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Easy-Pre-Diabetes-Cookbook-Healthy/dp/1507216556/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64542223%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11196611/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating blueberries every day may yield health benefits in just two weeks, Pincus points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though their seasonality varies depending on where in the world you’re located, they can be found year-round in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate blueberries every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a type 1 diabetic, the biggest benefit I saw from eating blueberries every day was the effect it had on my blood sugar (a.k.a. blood glucose). Swapping my afternoon snack with them instead of a large apple or banana (which have, on average, more carbohydrates) allowed me to maintain more stable blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures the level of glucose between the layers of my skin. This showed the impact blueberries had on my general blood sugars—mainly, eating around a cup led to fewer spikes, and more even numbers than some higher-carb snacks. As a type 1 diabetic, I do need to administer insulin (I opt for an insulin pump) when I eat anything with carbohydrates (note: carbs, not just sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I’m not one for ultra-processed foods, I do enjoy some low-cal, low-carb options from time to time. Swapping these for blueberries led me to feeling more satisfied, less weighed down, and more nourished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential benefits of blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugars aside, I didn’t notice much of the purported benefits (more specifics below), including getting sick less (in fact, I ended up getting the flu a few days after completing this experiment). But research does note the following health benefits of eating blueberries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Full of antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; play an important role in reducing inflammation, and polyphenols found in blueberries are powerful antioxidants that prevent or reverse damage to cells caused by the aging process,” Pincus says. Antioxidants also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10630845/#:~:text=5.6.,et%20al.%2C%202006)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;support the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, so eating blueberries consistently may, in theory, help your body fight off illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Boost heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wild blueberries in particular (the tiny ones) have 33% more deep purply blue anthocyanins and two times the antioxidants of ordinary blueberries, which can help protect the cardiovascular system and reduce &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25578927/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;,” Pincus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help with cognition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30999017/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; is showing that wild blueberries can improve the cognitive performance of children and adolescents, and have been shown to slow cognitive decline with aging,” Pincus says. But more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maintain stable blood sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that I’ve witnessed firsthand. I saw little spikes in my blood sugar in the hours following eating a cup (something that is not the case when opting for more carbohydrate-dense foods like a banana). Pincus notes that blueberries may help improve insulin sensitivity to assist with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; back this up too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberry nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), 100 grams of blueberries, or 3.5-ounces (around 1/2 cup), contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 0.7 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbs: 14.5 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar: 10 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 2.4 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many blueberries?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like just about anything in life, eating too many blueberries may cause some side effects. “Blueberries contain fiber, which most people do not consume enough of; however, too much for someone not used to a high fiber diet could result in gas, bloating, or discomfort,” Pincus notes. She says that blueberries contain &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/calcium-oxalate-stones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxalates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oxalates&lt;/a&gt; (naturally occurring plant compounds that binds minerals), which are not a concern for most people. “However, those with a history of or predisposition for kidney stones may not want to overdo it.” Finally, she points out that though great in moderation, blueberries contain natural sugars, so eating too many may impact blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly add more to your routine by making any of the below delicious, healthy recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating blueberries every day left me with more stable blood sugars after consuming them, but that’s pretty much the main benefit I saw in my brief experiment. I do continue to eat them weekly, and have done so for years, so perhaps it’s been a gradual change that is too incremental for me to notice. Regardless, blueberries are one of my favorite foods, and I’ll continue to enjoy them as a part of a nutritious eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:02:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBlV3BmdW5keC1vRHg1SVlBcnhtc3lzNnBRXzllMXJ3ZktWdmhBd0ptY3dzSjNEd0hiZ3VZajZ2SkMtcHcxUHhQRzgxa25Ec1h3MTRLaG1pMEpHR21Sa2hEY1pVN2lSNFJpbTdKNFR5VQ</guid></item><item><title>蒙大拿州35年来首次出现麻疹病例- Daily Kos | Montana has its first measles cases in 35 years - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZlNOUk9ySEsybHlrQlpLcU5vTFUxVXYyVjdNcDFwUEg5aXo1NWUyMHVzZUZ5eWlJbXgxVGFhZkIxZDVpMG44aEF4dWRXLS01bVVRVDF6MndLMWRvX3l2d0xqeUdsd3NIby1lSmZGV2Z0alRhZnpzRjNHblNIQXhEeUd2M21CdkxhUU1OTXJXc3IwZlZjUWhhNURHeVVpSFpT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Montana is the ninth U.S. state to have an active measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was up to 800&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2" target="_blank" title=""&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nationwide on Friday.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is driving the high numbers, with an outbreak centered in West Texas that started nearly three months ago and is up to 597 cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" target="_blank"&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;died from measles-related illnesses near&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" target="_blank" title=""&gt;the epicenter in Texas,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-kansas-ohio-mmr-vaccination-new-mexico-texas-569474272df9baaad1f6d73462ebe92a" target="_blank"&gt;states with active outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;— defined as three or more cases — include Indiana,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Michigan, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549" target="_blank"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts fear the virus will&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2" target="_blank"&gt;take hold in other U.S. communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with low vaccination rates and that the spread&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-6cfda9a944084c390bc70f0e7a37a426" target="_blank"&gt;could stretch on for a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, an outbreak in Ontario, Canada has sickened 925 from mid-October through April 16. That's on top of cases in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;that the World Health Organization has said are linked to the Texas outbreak. A large outbreak in Chihuahua state has 433 cases as of April 18, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what else you&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" target="_blank"&gt;need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas state health officials said Friday there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;597 across 25 counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;— most of them in West Texas. Four more Texans were hospitalized, for a total of 62 throughout the outbreak, and Parmer and Potter counties logger their first cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials estimated about 4% of cases — fewer than 30 — are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 371 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county's residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" target="_blank"&gt;8-year-old child,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank"&gt;child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in late February — Kennedy said age 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced five new cases this week, bringing the state’s total to 63. Three more people were in the hospital this week, for a total of six since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Two are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported its first&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299" target="_blank"&gt;measles-related death in an adult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma remained steady at 12 total cases Friday: nine confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Rogers and Custer counties, but wouldn't say which counties had cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 30 measles cases in the state Thursday. The state county includes only Ohio residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties, the state said. The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, say there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Indiana?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana confirmed two more cases Monday in an outbreak that has sickened eight in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — five are unvaccinated minors and three are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Pennsylvania?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In far northwest Pennsylvania, Erie County health officials declared a measles outbreak April 14 after finding two new cases linked to a measles case confirmed March 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has had nine cases overall this year, six of which are not linked to the outbreak, including international travel-related cases in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/health/documents/topics/documents/2025%20HAN/2025-787-3-13-ADV-%20Measles.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Michigan?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has three linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to a large measles outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has seven confirmed measles cases as of Thursday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. Michigan's last measles outbreak was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montana state health officials announced five cases Thursday in unvaccinated children and adults who had traveled out of state, and confirmed it was an outbreak on Monday. All five are isolating at home in Gallatin County in the southwest part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials are working to trace exposures in Bozeman and Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are Montana's first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn't say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been 800 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 10 clusters — defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-asia-measles-rates-unicef-who-report-2f888732cc297090238956986fd89cc4" target="_blank"&gt;someone who caught the disease abroad&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-cdc-outbreak-chicago-mmr-vaccine-7ecdfef41e6dbd659c7ac8b80d5de38f" target="_blank"&gt;a rise in measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, including an outbreak in Chicago that&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b" target="_blank"&gt;sickened more than 60.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been detected in wastewater samples from a sewage plant in Greenville, NC. Samples from the plant tested in late March and early April indicate that someone in Greenville during that time had the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There are two genetic types of the Mpox virus, known as clade I and clade II. The type found in Greenville's wastewater was clade I. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"The detection of clade I mpox virus in wastewater surveillance tells us the virus is potentially here in our state, even though no cases have been reported and confirmed," said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While no Mpox cases have been reported in the state, Sangvai urged doctors and other health care providers to be on the lookout for people showing the symptoms. Any Mpox infection should be reported to the local health department or the NCDHHS Division of Public Health’s 24/7 epidemiologist
on-call number: 919-733-3419.





&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpox?mc_cid=5621fa4c5f&amp;amp;mc_eid=e5671e7d27"&gt;Mpox infection&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by rash on hands, feet, chest, face or mouth, or near the genitals and symptoms like fever, chills and swollen lymph nodes. Mpox is primarily spread by prolonged close contact, typically skin-to-skin, often during sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; "We encourage people who are at higher risk to protect themselves by getting vaccinated," Sangvai added. Those &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpoxvaxlocations"&gt;vaccines are available by appointment&lt;/a&gt; at all North Carolina county health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

The air turned orange. Headlines called it the worst air quality in the world. People wore masks again, not for COVID-19, but to avoid inhaling toxic particles. But what if you lived in a place with no way to measure that danger?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State University&lt;/a&gt; reveals a chilling reality. More than 50 million people in the U.S. live in what researchers call “air quality monitoring deserts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are counties with no official monitoring stations to assess air pollution. Without these stations, we don’t know what people are breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-quality-monitoring-deserts"&gt;Air quality monitoring deserts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts are places with zero air-quality stations. That means no sensors, no alerts, and no data on the pollutants people are exposed to each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, 1,848 counties in the U.S. qualify as monitoring deserts. That’s nearly 59% of all counties and covers about 40% of the land area in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-people-die-from-air-pollution-each-year-yet-theres-still-a-lack-of-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; pollution has been directly and indirectly to cancers, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, immune disorders and more,” said Alexis Santos, co-author of the study and associate professor at Penn State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are not measuring air quality in large regions of the country, then we do not know how significant air pollution problems are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-danger-of-data-gaps"&gt;The danger of data gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air quality data helps determine public health responses. If a wildfire breaks out and there’s no monitoring, people cannot know whether it’s safe to go outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a growing need to assess whether children should stay indoors or whether vulnerable people should wear masks. And yet, millions live in this uncertainty every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These gaps don’t just delay emergency responses. They affect how we understand long-term health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link air &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/understanding-how-air-pollution-forms-may-help-us-prevent-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; to asthma, heart attacks, dementia, and premature death. But in unmonitored counties, those links remain invisible and unquantified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-minority-areas-lack-air-quality-monitoring"&gt;Minority areas lack air quality monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked demographic and economic factors to the presence – or absence – of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counties with high poverty, low high school completion, or larger Black and Hispanic populations are more likely to be unmonitored. These patterns held even after accounting for population size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution affects everyone’s health, so it is important for everyone in the nation to have access to accurate information about the quality of the air they breathe,” said Nelson Roque, assistant professor at Penn State and the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern region was especially affected. In states like Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas, more than 75% of counties are monitoring deserts. These regions include parts of the “Southern Black Belt,” a historically marginalized area with persistent social and economic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-air-pollution-affects-consumer-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disadvantages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-monitoring-is-old-and-unreliable"&gt;Air monitoring is old and unreliable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-weakens-brain-function-and-focus-in-daily-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; monitoring in the U.S. began in 1957. Since then, more than 20,000 stations have been installed at some point. But by 2024, only 4,821 remained active. Many stations were decades old, with a median age of 26.1 years. Some stopped reporting due to technical issues or lack of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ran this same analysis just a couple months apart, and we found that the number of air-quality monitoring sites had changed over that short period of time,” Roque said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These stations are in flux all the time, and data-reporting intervals also vary, which points to the need for investment in and modernization of this infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of consistency adds uncertainty. Researchers and communities rely on these stations for accurate trends. If the equipment goes offline, so does our ability to respond in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smartphones-can-t-replace-sensors"&gt;Smartphones can’t replace sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps may show air quality ratings, but they don’t gather air directly. These apps use data from nearby stations. If you live far from a monitoring site, your app could show safe air when, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-deaths-in-india-linked-to-air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; levels are high. That’s misleading and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts, by definition, depend on estimates from surrounding regions. In rural areas, that might mean using data from stations dozens or even hundreds of miles away. Local factors – like nearby industry, agriculture, or wildfires – can vary dramatically from region to region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means people in these counties might make poor health decisions based on faulty information. And public health officials lack the tools to guide them differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-quality-monitoring-gaps-reflect-injustice"&gt;Air quality monitoring gaps reflect injustice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental monitoring follows patterns of social inequality. The researchers found that counties with more agricultural or mining jobs and fewer educated adults were more likely to be unmonitored. Higher poverty levels also increased the odds of being a monitoring desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, areas with more Hispanic residents appeared less likely to be deserts. But when population size was factored in, this trend reversed. Counties with more Black residents consistently had higher odds of lacking monitoring, regardless of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns are not accidental. “Generally speaking, infrastructure for health care, transportation, education and other areas are underdeveloped in rural counties,” Santos said. “This study demonstrated the pattern holds true for air-quality monitoring, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-call-for-broader-monitoring"&gt;A call for broader monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Executive Order 14008 urged environmental equity. The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool now includes air quality as a measure of community disadvantage. Despite these efforts, monitoring deserts persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring infrastructure is concentrated in urban areas, where populations are dense. This makes sense for national averages, but fails millions in sparsely populated or economically struggling areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA and local partners must rethink this model. Where there is no data, there is no protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-local-efforts-and-global-parallels"&gt;Local efforts and global parallels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some states and cities try to fill the gap. For example, the New York City Community Air Survey collects seasonal data at multiple points across the city. These local programs give better insights into neighborhood conditions, yet not all regions have the resources or expertise to launch their own systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, many countries face similar problems. Citizen science, wearable sensors, and community-led efforts are helping close gaps. But in the U.S., a wealthier country with strong scientific institutions, the scale of unmonitored areas is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers warn that areas without monitoring may actually experience worse air quality than we realize. Without data, these communities are invisible in national health research and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-needs-to-happen-next"&gt;What needs to happen next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing the system requires more than adding a few monitors. The technology must be modern, reliable, and consistent. It must cover both cities and rural areas. Most importantly, it must reflect a commitment to environmental justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors argue for equitable expansion of monitoring sites. Only then can we understand exposure, assess disparities, and design better public health responses. Until that happens, millions will keep breathing air they cannot see, cannot measure, and cannot trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts expose more than air pollution. They reveal the cracks in how we protect public health. When a wildfire erupts or pollutants rise, people in these places won’t know. They’ll just keep breathing – and hoping it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2425310122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

Dr. Joseph Antoun&lt;/a&gt; told DailyMail.com that he works to help bridge the gap between scientific research and practical solutions that help people live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The science of longevity is becoming democratized as more research demonstrates that simple interventions - from nutrition timing to stress management - can profoundly impact biological aging,' Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after years of research and treating patients, he said that he has a few general tips that can help people not only live longer, but also have more fulfilling and healthier lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Focus on relationships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Antoun explained that social capital is crucial for emotional well-being and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why it's important for people to nurture meaningful relationships and create a strong sense of community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said to prioritize connections with family, friends, and your community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can look like scheduling a shared meal with loved ones, joining a community group that meets regularly, or calling a friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Longevity doctor Dr. Joseph Antoun said that the focus is shifting from just living longer to living healthier as well (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Eat well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This one shouldn't be much of a surprise, but Dr. Antoun emphasized the importance of nutrition in your journey to living longer and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Food is the only product we consume multiple times daily, making it a critical factor in longevity,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether this means choosing a healthy diet that works for you or making sure you're always getting as many nutrients as possible, Dr. Antoun said that your nutrition should absolutely be made a priority.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Again, this is all about making healthy choices for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regular physical activity is essential for both physical and mental well-being,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even short bursts of exercise can have significant benefits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that finding an activity you enjoy and making it a consistent part of your routine is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don't have much time to get in a full workout, he suggested taking morning walks, parking farther from entrances so that you have to walk further, taking the stairs instead of escalators, and standing up every hour at your desk.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Antoun said that focusing on nutrition and exercise is key to living longer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress can cause a lot of damage to the body.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Chronic stress can accelerate aging, so it's crucial to have effective stress management techniques,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggested meditation and mindfulness, as they can be extremely beneficial to relieving stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Also, don't underestimate the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Get good sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people are not well rested, and this is affecting their ability to live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Antoun said that quality sleep is fundamental to health and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, good sleep hygiene can significantly impact your overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Aim to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimize your sleep environment,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tiny but powerful is one way to describe chia seeds. These little black (sometimes white) seeds absorb water to form a thick gel that can boost the texture and nutrition of all sorts of foods, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8051021/overnight-oats-with-chia-seeds/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, pancakes, smoothies, puddings and more. In addition to their unique texture, 1 ounce of chia seeds provides an impressive 4.5 grams of protein, 10 grams of fiber and 5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also an excellent source of minerals like magnesium and phosphorus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating chia seeds is an excellent way to boost your soluble fiber intake and lower your LDL cholesterol levels,” says&lt;a href="https://brittanyb.ca/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brittany Brown, RD, IBCLC&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and lactation consultant at Feeding Babies, Nourishing Souls. But, as with many things in life, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. For some people, the side effects of eating too many chia seeds could be severe, or at the very least, inconvenient.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone will experience negative side effects when including chia seeds in their diet. Still, it’s a good idea to be aware of what could happen and the risks of eating too many at once. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One side effect of eating chia seeds on a regular basis that isn’t talked about enough is its potential to interfere with micronutrient absorption,” says &lt;a href="https://theoregondietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Megan Byrd, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Oregon Dietitian. While the high soluble fiber content of chia seeds helps to minimize the absorption of fat and glucose (aka sugar), it can also lower the absorption of essential minerals like zinc, calcium and iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re deficient in any of these nutrients, Byrd recommends talking to your doctor or dietitian for personalized advice on whether to include chia seeds in your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Experience Digestive Troubles &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7628198/the-1-food-to-help-you-poop-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best foods to relieve constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Their soluble fiber content helps add volume and bulk to stool, making it pass more easily. However, when added too quickly or without enough water, these tiny seeds may cause or worsen digestive issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Adding chia seeds too fast and without proper amounts of water can actually lead to bloating, gas and constipation or diarrhea,” says &lt;a href="https://katrinacoxrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Katrina Cox,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian specializing in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Adding chia seeds and other high-fiber foods to your diet slowly and with plenty of fluids can help prevent digestive distress. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating chia seeds dry could pose a choking risk, thanks to their ability to absorb liquid and expand up to 27 times their weight in water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s recommended to avoid eating large amounts of dry chia seeds, when mixed with water, chia seeds can be a beneficial solution for some people who experience dysphagia and require thickened liquids—just be sure to talk to a health care professional first.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Could Increase Your Risk of Kidney Stones &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are full of health-promoting nutrients, but if you are prone to kidney stones, specifically oxalate kidney stones, they might not be a good choice. Chia seeds are high in oxalates, compounds found in varying amounts in many plant foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One strategy to avoid this is pairing chia seeds with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-calcium-foods-that-arent-dairy-8661064" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-calcium food&lt;/a&gt;. Calcium binds to oxalate in the stomach, preventing it from being absorbed and transported to the kidneys.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you experience frequent kidney stones, talk with your health care provider about how to safely eat chia seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Interact with Your Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating too many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-chia-seeds-may-interact-with-your-medications-8683669" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds could interact with your medications&lt;/a&gt;, making them more or less effective. Certain compounds in chia seeds have blood pressure–lowering effects and antiplatelet properties that help prevent blood clots. While these properties are beneficial for many, they could interact with medications that already have these effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, because soluble fiber helps lower blood sugar by slowing digestion and preventing absorption of some carbohydrates, it may lead to low blood sugars when used along with certain diabetes medications. Talk to your health care provider before eating chia seeds if you take blood thinners, like warfarin, or medications to help manage blood sugar levels or lower blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are no official recommendations for how many chia seeds to eat daily. However, guidelines around daily fiber intake may help you decide. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce—about 2.5 tablespoons—of chia seeds provides 10 grams of fiber, or 35% of the recommended Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Some providers will recommend up to 5 tablespoons per day, but that is dependent on the person and tolerance levels. It is always advised to increase slowly and ensure proper water intake with the increase of fiber,” says Cox. People who have IBS or take blood sugar– or blood pressure–lowering medications may want to limit their chia seed consumption, unless otherwise directed by a health care professional. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you want the benefits without the gelatinous texture or are looking for a slightly different nutrition profile, try one of these chia seed alternatives: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground flaxseed:&lt;/strong&gt; Like chia seeds, ground flaxseed is a good source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids and fiber—but with a nuttier flavor and smoother texture. “It’s versatile like chia seeds and can be placed in smoothies, oatmeal or as a vegan egg replacement,” says Cox. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemp seeds:&lt;/strong&gt; These little seeds provide just 1 gram of fiber per ounce, but have twice the protein of chia seeds. They’re also a great source of plant-based omega-3s and minerals like magnesium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike chia seeds, they don’t absorb water. Instead, they provide a pleasant crunch to oatmeal, yogurt and salads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psyllium husk&lt;/strong&gt;: Cox recommends psyllium husk as a high-fiber alternative to chia seeds. You’ll find more fiber in psyllium husk, with 1 ounce providing 12 grams, most of which is soluble. Research has found that taking psyllium husk supplements may improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels and manage constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a highly nutritious addition to many diets—they’re an excellent source of fiber, plant-based omega-3s and several essential minerals. But too much of a good thing can backfire. If you’re adding chia seeds to your meals, be sure to do so gradually, drink plenty of water and pay attention to how your body feels. And if you have digestive issues, a history of kidney stones or take certain medications, it’s a good idea to check with your doctor or dietitian before making these tiny seeds a daily staple.

&lt;p&gt;“Since chia seeds are high in phytoestrogens, there is some thought that eating more of them could reduce the large fluctuations in estrogen levels,” says Brown. However, research is ongoing and does not yet fully support this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 bNYvfb cEegOB"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 gEpeSZ iTNirO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1400"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1401"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1402"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPa2NYNjV3alZIUVFxdmdZdVlHbWNrMzNCTFBnbDNoT3M5anNLYV81QnZaaXNIS0NGR0I2YldqMXozRTBzVGdsb3hKZXBncmdxOTFpTXNmeHZvVXNLMzk4MmZHVExYLVFYOGsyWXhuaFRESzBERFV6QXc2T2I0VXdZVWMzOHFaaHR0dXF6bUw0dWFFN3JiQ25KVmJxdTB4WGgtMDhkamw3ZEFoUTdtbkpyNg</guid></item><item><title>单一食物是降低痴呆风险的“最重要” - Surrey Live | One single food is the 'most important' for reducing dementia risk - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZXEzMHdkeXMzWjVvT2lVUjI4MmdmVXBSNWNWNzRBaDdkZlNiQTg2MXF3Y241OV9WWklTejJZdXlhMjJ3U3dpV2k1TkRrY3lhRWZkSXRIcndBSzJDM0pfRElxNHVoMC0wd1dTbTRtMVFkcDR4WXRldjk5Tm1jZkpicUxyQWV6Z9IBiwFBVV95cUxPbzZ6RzdCMHJ4OFRldnhwWU5jMmxsN0FaVENZY0NsR0ZrY1NrdWFkYmNnQlNEaU5nV3NDVU41dlAzbXJjMHg5Tkx3RGxqZmhWTXV0MXh6WFVoN1FQUlZjZGRjUDZsRlVEU0kxVEVfOFZuT1ZpOFdQb0JhWHM4UWowbGNMNDBvZ3BaQVVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the population ages, &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;dementia &lt;/a&gt;rates are on the rise, yet researchers suggest that &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;lifestyle choices &lt;/a&gt;might help fend off cognitive deterioration in older age.

These symptoms often intensify with time but could be lessened through specific dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is consensus among experts that a Mediterranean-style diet plays a key role in warding off brain decay. This diet, which can vary from one region to another, generally consists of a large intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, beans, cereals, grains, fish, along with unsaturated fats like olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have investigated the wider &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits of this particular diet, but one study, conducted by the National Institutes of Health, tracked over 7,750 people for between five to ten years to pick apart which elements make it so beneficial, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/foods-reduce-risk-of-dementia-30261037" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study participants filled out food frequency questionnaires, and their cognitive functions including memory, language, and attention were evaluated through phone tests. From the gathered data, researchers pinpointed dietary components most effective at decreasing the likelihood of cognitive impairment and decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31484399" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harvard Health has identified fish as the "single most important dietary factor" in a study that linked its consumption to a reduced risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fish?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A publication in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7103640/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; sheds light on the subject, explaining: "Fish is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids that are present in the membranes of the brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, at the other end of the spectrum, there are some foods which could be contributing to brain deterioration. The&lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/nutrition/dementia-diet#:~:text=Five%20foods%20to%20avoid%20or%20limit%20to%20help%20your%20brain%3A&amp;amp;text=Cheese%20(less%20than%20once%20a,than%20one%20tablespoon%20a%20day)" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; British Heart Foundation (BHF)&lt;/a&gt; recommends moderating intake of five particular foods to support better brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fried or fast food&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cheese&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Red meats&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pastries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31484400" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you're searching for what foods you should be incorporating into your everyday diet, you should consider foods, such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wholegrains (three or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, spring greens, kale and salad leaves (one or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Other vegetables (one or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (on most days)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Beans and lentils (three or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Berries, including blueberries and strawberries (two or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chicken or turkey (two or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fish (one or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Olive oil (as the main oil or fat you use)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wine (no more than one small glass a day – more than this and it becomes more likely to harm health than help it)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to diet, maintaining physical activity is also key to minimising the likelihood of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?utm_source=newslettersignupfooter" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;b&gt;If you want ideas and inspiration to plan your next UK adventure plus selected offers and competitions, sign up for our 2Chill weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZXEzMHdkeXMzWjVvT2lVUjI4MmdmVXBSNWNWNzRBaDdkZlNiQTg2MXF3Y241OV9WWklTejJZdXlhMjJ3U3dpV2k1TkRrY3lhRWZkSXRIcndBSzJDM0pfRElxNHVoMC0wd1dTbTRtMVFkcDR4WXRldjk5Tm1jZkpicUxyQWV6Z9IBiwFBVV95cUxPbzZ6RzdCMHJ4OFRldnhwWU5jMmxsN0FaVENZY0NsR0ZrY1NrdWFkYmNnQlNEaU5nV3NDVU41dlAzbXJjMHg5Tkx3RGxqZmhWTXV0MXh6WFVoN1FQUlZjZGRjUDZsRlVEU0kxVEVfOFZuT1ZpOFdQb0JhWHM4UWowbGNMNDBvZ3BaQVVR</guid></item><item><title>性激素是大脑激素。这对治疗脑部疾病意味着什么？ -《纽约时报》 | Sex Hormones Are Brain Hormones.

Besides playing a key role in sexual and reproductive health, it strengthens bones, keeps skin supple, regulates sugar levels, increases blood flow, lowers inflammation and supports the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You name the organ, and it promotes the health of that organ,” said Roberta Brinton, a neuroscientist who leads the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But appreciation for estrogen’s more expansive role has been slow in coming. The compound was first identified in 1923 and was henceforth known as the “female sex hormone” — a one-dimensional reputation baked into its very name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Estrogen” comes from the Greek “oestrus,” a literal gadfly known for whipping cattle into a mad frenzy. Scientifically, estrus has come to mean the period in the reproductive cycles of some mammals when females are fertile and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Women don’t enter estrus; they menstruate. Nevertheless, when researchers named estrogen, these were the roles it was cast in: inducing a frenzy and supporting female sexual health. Now, estrogen is gaining recognition for what may be its most important role yet: influencing the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neuroscientists have learned that estrogen is vital to healthy brain development but that it also contributes to conditions including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. Changes in estrogen levels — either from the menstrual cycle or external sources — can exacerbate migraines, seizures and other common neurological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

A child admitted to a Dallas hospital in the late 1980s had been sick for days with a fever, rash and no clear diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s measles,” said Kline, an infectious disease expert who recognized the signs from treating hundreds of cases in Uganda earlier in his career. None of the pediatricians or nurses had considered it. They’d never treated a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, the same unfamiliarity with a disease thought to be eliminated could ripple through emergency rooms in Louisiana as hospitals prepare for the possibility of local cases amid a nationwide outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With two cases identified in Louisiana and vaccination rates slipping below the threshold for community protection, hospitals are preparing by educating their staff on symptoms and reviewing protocols for isolation and contact tracing. Many health care providers in Louisiana have never seen a case outside of a textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of them are too young to have actually seen a case with their own eyes,” said Kline, now physician in chief at Manning Family Children’s in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana's first case was announced by the state health department on Saturday in an unvaccinated adult who had recently traveled internationally and was treated for measles at a New Orleans-area hospital. That person is not hospitalized and is now in isolation. As officials located others the patient had been in contact with, they discovered a second case in a New Orleans-area adult who is no longer infectious, health officials said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms usually begin 7 to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads from the face downward. Complications can be severe, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana had three travel-associated measles cases in 2024. Prior to that, the last recorded case was in 2018. That patient had traveled to Louisiana from Europe to attend Wrestlemania and sought care at an urgent care and ER before being diagnosed at Tulane Hospital, highlighting the potential of a missed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren't familiar with it, or don't have it on their mind, they can make a mistake,” said Dr. John Schieffelin, professor of pediatrics at Tulane University and pediatric infectious disease chief at Manning Family Children’s. At that hospital, triage nurses and urgent care staff have been placed on high alert for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health recently ended statewide mass vaccination efforts and directed staff to refrain from recommending specific vaccines and to instead tell residents to consult their physicians, part of a broader policy change under Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Abraham said Monday that the state has been promoting the measles vaccination on the LDH website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recommend it for our children, and it is a good vaccine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing for local spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the latest case was travel-related and no pediatric cases have been reported in Louisiana this year, local spread remains a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d be naive to think that we won’t be seeing cases in children here in Louisiana,” Kline said, pointing to the state's proximity to Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;where nearly 600 measles cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Two unvaccinated school-aged children have died there, and at least 62 people have been hospitalized. The outbreak has spread to nearby states of New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kara Ward, a critical care and emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, said that even a single case can be operationally disruptive. Hospitals must notify public health authorities, isolate the patient, assess the vaccination status of anyone who may have been exposed in waiting areas, and implement special cleaning procedures due to the virus’s ability to linger in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It puts more strain on the limited resources,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochsner Health, the state’s biggest health system, is continuing to educate staff on measles symptoms and likelihood based on travel history and vaccination status as the Texas outbreak has grown, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director of patient safety. If a patient is suspected to have measles, they are given a mask and isolated. The hospital contacts the state health department, and those authorities decide whether a test is necessary. The test is processed by a state lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccine coverage declines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine — part of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) shot — is about 97% effective after two doses. Widespread vaccination eliminated measles in the U.S. in 2000, but resurgences have occurred in communities with declining vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Louisiana, MMR vaccination rates among kindergartners dropped from about 96% in 2020 to 92% in the 2023–2024 school year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Several parishes, including Livingston, East Baton Rouge, St. Tammany, Acadia, Lafayette, Terrbonne, Union, Ouachita and West Carroll &lt;a href="https://analytics.la.gov/t/LDH/views/SchoolImmunizationDashboard/Kindergarten?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank"&gt;have rates below 90%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have sort of dipped below that threshold of herd immunity in Louisiana,” said Schieffelin. “In some areas, we could start seeing some ongoing transmission if it gets introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the first MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months and again around kindergarten, some pediatricians are getting requests to give it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday after Louisiana confirmed a measles case, Hales Pediatrics in Uptown New Orleans received a wave of calls from concerned parents, said Dr. Nora Oates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children as young as six months can receive an early dose of the measles vaccine, though they will still need two standard doses later, as infants’ immune systems often don’t mount a full response at that age.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="8"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the early dose is typically reserved for infants traveling to or living in areas with active outbreaks, Oates said she would “have no reservations about giving it” if a parent was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who are unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history can also get immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No specific treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles, said Kemmerly, just supportive care. Severe cases might be managed with steroids or vitamin D. For immunocompromised people, immune globulin is available if administered shortly after exposure. The measles vaccine can also prevent infection or lessen illness severity if given within 72 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Our best treatment for measles is prevention,” Oates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="9"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated measles patients is hospitalized. One in 20 children develops pneumonia, the most common cause of measles-related death in young children. One to three of every 1,000 children with measles will die from complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite misinformation about alternative treatments circulating, there are not a lot of treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

In England, 31% of men and 26% of women have high blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half of the people with high blood pressure are not diagnosed or receiving treatment. In England alone, there are thought to be more than five million people that are undiagnosed. Among the 27,000 participants in the study, 19 per cent reported using one or more blood pressure-raising medications, and 4 per cent reported using multiple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly one-quarter (24%) of women with high blood pressure reported using a blood pressure raising medication compared with 14% of men. Cardiologist &lt;span&gt;Dr John Vitarello, at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston, said: "These are medications that we commonly take--both over-the-counter and prescribed medications - that may have the unintended side effect of raising blood pressure and could have adverse effects on our heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We know that high blood pressure leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke and death and even small increases in blood pressure can have meaningful impacts on cardiovascular disease. &lt;span&gt;Based on our findings, we need to be more aware of polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications by a single patient) in older adults who also have the highest burden of high blood pressure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Vitarello said the findings suggest, in some cases, rather than treating high blood pressure with more medications, there may be opportunities to lower blood pressure by deprescribing or substituting safer medications. &lt;span&gt;For example, there may be other classes of medications to treat the same condition that have less impact on blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was presented at the American College of Cardiology's 70th Annual Scientific Session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNbkM5U2s2bXNaNC1zcmtoQWpLd0RjOUNWbjlOMDZVb1lIVDRYc0d4VlVxRjd3R2VaTHZNY2oweklwTmtZc1J0aGJlNGFablBFcmN6QTBPemdYM3RNTmZJUWdncm5fRkdfX0xRTjdMemVBVEFDMFNMdXlMdHJXb0hnNlhFdlhvNGJ0Y25FRUZWSdIBlAFBVV95cUxNMzRCelJWOHZ6S1hfM1k2blA2MThIQnJ2QzlDVlFONXRJNTYzQlhzUElwQmIxUHRiYXJEM1ZiZ3JKRzZLLUl2VjlzcUNQNDZLT050N0c5dE1ZQmdWM2wyMi1oV3Q1NDN4OWRsMkFtNW0tZ2NCc1NzSjhGeUpkdW5EUkZ2Wl9BRU0xaTN3WmpXYi1ncVhp</guid></item><item><title>家长，放下手机-调度 | Parents, Put Down the Phones - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNVkRaVW1sVnFwdGo5amhpMjRzMTIxWlBkckFQdFhjZDZwSDU0NTNqazJSN1d1Y3hzYUl1WDRIMF9YdHI0NEVOemw3eVlYdzd0cHA1UGhzN1JOX2hJbnBIUGZkczlfVmlYbEtLYkxwaVhHYUQyZVBkUFNISXRsQ0pPOVpKS202M1RZOGxsSzBVOTZrUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most efforts to protect kids from the harms of technology focus on delaying smartphones and social media for children and getting phones out of schools. As a tech policy expert, I fully endorse these solutions, but one key and often overlooked part of the equation is what &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; must do about their own technology use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need only look around at a playground today to see it. Kids run around while their parents stare down at screens in their hands, oblivious to the noise, chaos, and needs of their children. Children tug on parents’ arms or scream for attention, and the parents often seem not to register it. At least not until the child throws a fit big enough to snap them back to reality. Maybe you’ve seen a playground like this one, or seen parents pushing a child in the stroller or through the grocery store, eyes glued to their phones. If we’re honest with ourselves, we’ve all been guilty of being this parent at one time or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While digital technologies’ addictive effects are more harmful to the developing brains of children, adults are not immune. Parents’ compulsive screen behaviors hurt kids. In fact, a relatively new field of research focuses on this problem, which researchers call “technoference”: the phenomenon of digital technology interfering with parent-child relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the results of this research so far are not good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technoference"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Technoference.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that technoference negatively affects a child’s language learning, social and emotional development, and behavioral and emotional regulation, increasing attention-seeking behaviors, emotional outbursts, and rates of anxiety and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take language learning. According to some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/07/mother-on-instagram-baby-fell-down-stairs-parental-phone-use-children"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;, the children of adults who are frequently on their phones start school at a deficit, without the expected language or interpersonal skills for a 5-year-old. And children who attempt to engage with their parents but don’t get a response are less likely to initiate that interaction going forward—leading to the loss of critical learning opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These losses accumulate over time. Researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6185759/"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; that when phone use displaces parent-child verbal and nonverbal interactions, children receive less parental “scaffolding”—the just-adequate-enough support for a child to perform a new skill on his own—especially in developing their behavior regulation. The long-term result is a dysregulated child who struggles with behavioral difficulties, including tantrums, not being able to sit still, and getting easily frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents on phones are also &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317346084_Impact_of_Parents_Mobile_Device_Use_on_Parent-Child_Interaction_A_Literature_Review"&gt;less&lt;/a&gt; sensitive and responsive to their child’s bids for attention.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;And often, when children do manage to interrupt a parent, they are &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702199"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with hostility rather than engagement and affection. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24616357/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that parents are more likely to ignore children when using devices than when they are distracted with non-devices, whether reading a book or preparing a meal. Devices make parents uniquely less available—and that lack of attention can result in risky attention-seeking behavior in children. In other words, while handing a child a screen undermines their self-control, the &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; staring down at a screen seems to have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even babies feel the impact. When parents are looking down at a device, they are generally displaying a still face. This can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28944600/"&gt;distress&lt;/a&gt; an infant, because a still face—rather than an emoting one—displays a lack of attention, attention that infants rely on for their sense of security and emotional regulation. As a result, the infant will increasingly try to get the mother’s attention—and, if that fails, the infant will &lt;a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/research-still-face-experiment/"&gt;withdraw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, with teens. One &lt;a href="https://wheatley.byu.edu/report-teaching-by-example"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institution found that “depression was higher in teens when their parents reported higher levels of personal social media use.” In fact, “adolescents are nearly four times as likely to be depressed if their parents are high level social media users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies, toddlers, children, and teens. All are negatively impacted by parental device use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most dangerous of all, however, is that the technology blinds its users to these negative effects. While we are staring down at our screens, we cannot see the little eyes watching us. We don’t notice the needs right in front of us—and we don’t notice that we are forming the desire in our children for screens, too. When we spend so much time looking at, scrolling, and texting on our phones, our kids will want to copy us—after all, children naturally want to do what adults do. My four-year-old wants to wash the dishes in the sink because he sees me washing the dishes and my two boys are always asking my husband when they will get to shave like Daddy. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071205102433.htm"&gt;Yale study&lt;/a&gt; found that young children, in fact, “over-imitate” adults, meaning that even when children are warned &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do what they see an adult doing, they are often unable to avoid reproducing those adult actions. This study is sobering when it comes to our phones. Even when we tell our children not to look at phones, if we don’t follow the same command, it will be extremely difficult for children to not imitate our behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forging-a-new-relationship-with-our-phones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging a new relationship with our phones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, then, should parents do to free ourselves from the addictive pull of digital devices, so that we can reengage with our children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can start by separating ourselves from devices when kids are awake and we are with them. Have a designated phone box for your family so that at the end of the day, all phones go in the box and the family can be together without interruption. Place a basket near your door and put your phone in it when you come home and mute your phone and tablet so that you won’t be tempted by it. Inform your colleagues, friends, and family that you will not be responding to texts, calls, or emails for specific periods of time when you are with your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to live by the principle, “If I am with my children, then I am not on my phone.” Work to develop the skill of being mentally and emotionally present with your children instead. If they are young, get down on the floor and play with them, and involve them in what you are doing, whether in the kitchen or with chores. Make eye contact and engage them as much as possible. When you do need to do something on your phone while your children are present, resist the texting takeover of communication. Instead, try to make more voice calls, so they can hear you and know what you are doing. This also allows you to model good conversation skills for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also dumb down your phone, making it less appealing to pick up in the first place. Turn off notifications, put your phone in grayscale, and delete as many apps as possible, especially social media and other messaging apps. You can even take the internet browser off your phone entirely. If these changes sound daunting, you can always start smaller: Focus on identifying and eliminating at least one or two of the most tempting aspects of your phone for the long-term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, don’t be afraid to consider alternative phones to a smartphone. I made the switch two years ago, first to a Light phone and then more recently to a Wise phone, and while there are certain inconveniences, I don’t regret it for a second. I am freed from distraction and present for the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another step to remove yourself from the pull of tech is to establish rhythms of regular breaks from your phone, social media, the internet, and any digital technology. Consider a phone-free Saturday or Sunday as a family. Regular breaks will help restore a healthier relationship with technology. A recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/2/pgaf017/8016017?login=false"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that among adults who took a break from their smartphones by blocking the internet for just two weeks, 91 percent felt better after the break. “People had better mental health, better subjective well-being and better sustained attention,” &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5304417/smartphone-break-digital-detox-screen-addiction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Ward, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the study’s authors.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, taking regular breaks and being more physically distanced from our phones means going “old-fashioned” in our individual and family practices. Technology is always replacing something, so the best way to reduce tech dependence is to simply revert to the analog options. Have a family calendar on the wall. Use a notepad and pen to jot notes to yourself or to-do lists. Get an alarm clock for everyone to have next to their bed. Wear a real watch so that your phone isn’t your watch. Buy a family camera to use for pictures and videos so your phone isn’t your camera. Though these may feel like inconveniences in our fast-paced and hyperconnected world, you may find that returning to analog options benefits you and your family in ways you couldn’t have predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by adopting practices to help us put our phones down, we model for our children what healthy technology use as an adult looks like—and open their eyes to the wonder of the world around them, away from screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Since then, there’s no looking back. They are versatile tiny seeds with a powerful nutrient profile. So much so that they have the power to transform your health even if you eat soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist, recently shared on social media that consuming a tablespoon of chia seeds daily can be the best thing to do for your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reel uploaded on his personal handle, Dr. Sethi explains how chia seeds can help reset gut health, prompting an investigation into the effects of a two-week chia seed regimen on metabolism. Here are several benefits of incorporating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Provides fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny, nutrient-rich seeds can improve digestion due to their high fiber content, helping regulate bowel movements for those struggling with constipation, though adequate water intake is necessary to prevent bloating. High fibre in food helps in better movement of stools and prevent constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that consuming chia seeds can significantly improve gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeps you energetic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds provide sustained energy throughout the day through their combination of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. Therefore, they can prevent the energy slump during the day and keep you away from fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydrate you better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summertime may wreak havoc on your hydration levels. Too much sweating and harsh summer sun may cause water loss and severe dehydration. Chia seeds' ability to absorb water and form a gel-like substance aids in maintaining longer hydration, particularly beneficial for those who exercise or live in hot climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helps with weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to lose weight without much effort? Start taking soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks in your diet. Their expanding property in the stomach promotes feeling full for extended periods, potentially aiding in weight management, though overconsumption could lead to excess calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rich in omega&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The omega-3 fatty acids in chia seeds contribute to heart health, potentially reducing bad cholesterol and heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heals inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is the invitation to many diseases like liver problems and even cancer. The antioxidants present in chia seeds offer benefits for skin protection against inflammation. Consuming soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks may also prevent aging and promote strong, healthy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks can lead to many health benefits. However, it's important to eat them in moderation and drink plenty of water. Try adding them to smoothies, yogurt, or salads for a simple and healthy boost or you may also soak them in water overnight, add a few drops of lemon in the morning and drink as a quick fat burner protein rich drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 04:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当他们同意共同父母时，这位年轻的爸爸完全期待在他生孩子的夜晚睡眠不佳，但是他的前任在生孩子时不断打电话是一个不受欢迎的惊喜- TwistedSifter | When They Agreed To Co-Parent, This Young Dad Fully Expected Poor Sleep On The Nights He Had His Baby, But The Incessant Calls From His Ex When She Has Their Child Were An Unwelcome Surprise - TwistedSifter</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgJBVV95cUxNMXNvTTc3aXBGTFcxbmJFb0w5bE80UFk2LW15YThxckNTY2VIdl9qLVIwUDdEN1Z1d0tKMFZJMURSV0tHenplaWxTQlFFbGRSU2kyMHFIQXVnWm9rNFY1OW9uNVFhcU5VTS1jdjcwajh5M1lRRjJ4blZUQ0RxTldkLTlCQ2tsaGE1ZmZheGQtaTl6TzRpUUhmTVNkUy1KM3B2SG8wQ1RnZWgxTFJPQWdaRldhZllxRjd0cGJGUmNyaG9CZHQtaGxtcXVVSy01aUNRRGFmRGtOS2poczA1dXlMLUZ6WjdrSlJXYmxwaGlpc29ZN01OV0ExUHZNUERaajVYWVRSYUtKY29lUWhYSEQ3V0RxRXV3VnhmSnVBdjNPMnFveGJGUHRyWlRCWnRpX1R2a21GNHNJaXJiWVdjN2I2UzdSMlJzdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first years of a child’s life can be testing for the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard enough when you’re a united team, but when the relationship has broken down and you’re trying to effectively co-parent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, things are only going to get harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the young father in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jkmy2c/aita_for_telling_my_ex_to_stop_calling_me_in_the/?rdt=62604"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, the situation is even more difficult than he expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it’s not caring for his baby that is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out how his ex-girlfriend is pushing him to breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for telling my ex to stop calling me in the middle of the night for non-emergencies with the baby?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 19, and have a 10 month old son with my ex-girlfriend, who is 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We broke up shortly after our son was born but have been trying to co-parent as best as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my son for three days out of the week, while my ex has him the rest of the time because I work full-time to support myself and pay child support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is, my ex has been calling me almost every night, claiming there’s some sort of “emergency” with the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how these ’emergencies’ became problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I would answer immediately and even drive over to her place if she sounded panicked. But after a few weeks, I started noticing a pattern: none of these “emergencies” were actually serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time she called me at 2 a.m. because the baby was crying, and she “didn’t know what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time, it was because she ran out of formula, even though I had bought her a bulk supply the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, she called me because he had a mild fever, but when I suggested she give him infant Tylenol, she said she didn’t have any and expected me to bring some over immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes! This started having a real impact on his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m exhausted. I wake up at 4 in the morning every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the last call, I told her she needed to stop calling me in the middle of the night unless it’s a real emergency. I said if she felt overwhelmed, she could call her mom or take him to the doctor, but she couldn’t keep relying on me to drop everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She blew up at me, saying I was being selfish and that as the father, I should always be there for our son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She accused me of not caring about her struggles as a single mom and claimed I was making her feel unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out how he responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told her I would always be there for our son in a genuine emergency, but she needs to learn how to handle the day to  day stuff on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now she’s being cold and distant, and some mutual friends think I was out of line for telling her to stop calling, saying I don’t understand how hard it is to raise a baby full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a truly difficult situation for both parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the couple aren’t together, it’s not reasonable for her to expect him to drop everything to run around for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a genuine emergency sure, but this is practically just grocery trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what folks on Reddit thought about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Redditor thought that the young mom needed some alternative support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But others thought she might have ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-474786" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="Screenshot 2025 03 27 at 15.11.18 When They Agreed To Co Parent, This Young Dad Fully Expected Poor Sleep On The Nights He Had His Baby, But The Incessant Calls From His Ex When She Has Their Child Were An Unwelcome Surprise" title="When They Agreed To Co Parent, This Young Dad Fully Expected Poor Sleep On The Nights He Had His Baby, But The Incessant Calls From His Ex When She Has Their Child Were An Unwelcome Surprise" data-lazy-src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-15.11.18.png"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-474786" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-15.11.18.png" alt="Screenshot 2025 03 27 at 15.11.18 When They Agreed To Co Parent, This Young Dad Fully Expected Poor Sleep On The Nights He Had His Baby, But The Incessant Calls From His Ex When She Has Their Child Were An Unwelcome Surprise" title="When They Agreed To Co Parent, This Young Dad Fully Expected Poor Sleep On The Nights He Had His Baby, But The Incessant Calls From His Ex When She Has Their Child Were An Unwelcome Surprise"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this person had some clear advice.&lt;/p&gt;

On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to £20,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space – something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space," he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Lab-grown steak can be produced on Earth, but can it be created in space?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: "precision" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We can make all the elements to make food," says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;The brick-coloured "food" is grown in a small biorector, a mini-version of which has been sent into space &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix.

By 2023, that figure increased to 0.5 percent—a rise of over 66 percent in just four years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means that one in five heart attack patients are now younger than 40. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some experts have pointed to the Covid virus as a possible cause due to the strain it puts on the heart and its link to blood flow issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conspiracy theorists have also linked the rise to the Covid vaccines, though there is no evidence linking the shots to widespread heart attacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, a top cardiologist has revealed to DailyMail.com four factors he blames, based on the literature and his experience in the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai in New York, said there had been a notable shift in prescription drug use among young people which could be playing a role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart attacks among 18- to 44-year-olds increased 66 percent between 2019 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Prescription drug abuse &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall and Ritalin prescriptions surged by 14 percent during the pandemic, driven largely by the rapid rise of telehealth platforms and relaxed regulations that made it easier to obtain prescriptions through virtual consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2019 and 2022, roughly 5.9 million new stimulant scripts were written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increase was especially pronounced among young adults aged 20 to 39, who experienced a 30 percent rise in Schedule II stimulant prescriptions during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr. Levine, this dramatic spike in usage 'undoubtedly played a role' in the rise in heart attacks observed within this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall - a stimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - can increase the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular events when misused, as noted by the American College of Cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at a major university hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medication, which is taken by over 16million adults in the US, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13835837/Common-prescription-drug-taken-tens-millions-linked-five-fold-increase-mental-breakdown.html"&gt;increases attention and decreases hyperactivity &lt;/a&gt;in ADHD patients by increasing levels of dopamine (described as the feel-good hormone) in the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite being a commonly prescribed treatment, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency classifies Adderall as a Schedule II drug, the same status as cocaine - meaning they both have a high potential to be abused. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The feeling of euphoria the medication provides can lead to tolerance or dependence - both of which can prompt a patient to take higher doses of Adderall to achieve its effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can cause an addiction to the medication over time. Some common signs of Adderall abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, sweating, restlessness and dilated pupils. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At times, the medication can also constrict blood vessels and hamper blood flow which in turn, can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and increase chances of having an attack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excessive intake of Adderall can increase the risks of having a stroke or a heart attack as it can increase the overall heart rate and blood pressure higher than the baseline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the organ and obstruct blood flow to the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition where the wall of a coronary artery tears, potentially leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is commonly seen in young woman and most times, after they give birth, Dr Levine told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of the condition remains unknown, hormonal fluctuations, inflammation and possible underlying conditions like fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal growth of tissue within the walls of medium and large arteries) are suspected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCAD is becoming more prevalent, especially among younger adults and women for reasons still being understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past 25 years, studies have shown a clear rise in SCAD cases, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the heart and obstruct blood flow to the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This interruption of blood supply can deprive the heart muscles of oxygen and other essential nutrients, which can lead to damage and a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said it is essential that experts find 'more sensitive methods' to detect SCAD in young people to avoid cases of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Crime-related stress &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can cause psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress can have a major impact on health - from affecting sleep to raising blood pressure, not getting enough shut eye can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while work-related stress has often been the focus, Dr Levine told DailyMail.com that stress from crime may be a major contributor to early heart attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologist told DailyMail.com 'society has fallen apart over a number of years with fear of crime in so many [people]', which can lead to stress in the body and affect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the 2024 FBI crime report suggests a decrease in violent crimes including murder, homicide and car jackings, a study by Statista suggests 64 percent of Americans feel like there is more crime now in the country now than in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can have a psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to stress responses ranging from anxiety and fear to more long-term conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While stress itself cannot directly cause a heart attack, it can significantly contribute to the risk by increasing blood pressure and affecting blood flow, which can pose a risk for heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Obesity &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 100 million or 40.3 percent of Americans are suffering from obesity across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies estimate over 370,000 deaths per year in the US are linked to excessive body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity can raise cholesterol and blood pressure and lead to Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c4dad930-1eeb-11f0-b6a2-a344cd87ec8b" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; - all of which increase risks for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher need more blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to their bodies, which forces the heart to beat with more pressure to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extra weight also gives the body volume, which creates more resistance for the heart to overcome as it pumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The larger volume and increased resistance can result in the heart having to work much harder almost all the time. Since the organ is made of only muscle, the increased workload can cause pressure in the walls and increase blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is one of the most &lt;span&gt;common causes of heart attack and is the leading cause of death in obese individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, a group of researchers from across the globe found performing at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14559961/weekend-warriors-exercise-two-days-cancer.html"&gt;over the span of two days&lt;/a&gt; had similar health benefits as to working out the entire week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who only exercised on two days had a 32 percent lower risk of death from all causes, a 31 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 21 percent lower risk of dying from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends adults engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video with Edwards that has just come to light, CHD once again uses the situation to disparage MMR vaccines. Someone off camera asks Edwards if he had never had measles before, to which he replies that he had gotten an MMR vaccine as a kid, though he didn't know if he had gotten one or the recommended two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't work then, does it?" the off-camera person asks, referring to the MMR vaccine. "No, apparently not, " Edwards replies. "Just wear[s] off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Edwards had a breakthrough infection, which is rare, but it does occur. They're more common in people who have only gotten one dose, which is possibly the case for Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single dose of MMR is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses are 97 percent effective. In either case, the protection is considered lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While up to 97 percent effectiveness is extremely protective, some people do not mount protective responses and are still vulnerable to an infection upon exposure. However, their illnesses will likely be milder than if they had not been vaccinated. In the video, Edwards described his illness as a "mild case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data on the outbreak demonstrates the effectiveness of vaccination. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;As of April 18&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials have identified 597 measles cases, leading to 62 hospitalizations and two deaths in school-aged, unvaccinated children with no underlying medical conditions. Most of the cases have been in unvaccinated children. Of the 597 cases, 12 (2 percent) had received two MMR doses previously, and 10 (1.6 percent) had received one dose. The remaining 99 percent of cases are either unvaccinated or have no record of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the video, Edwards tells CHD he's "doing what any doctor should be doing."&lt;/p&gt;

However, they’re far from the only nutrient to consider. Saturated fat and sodium’s roles in blood sugar may not be as obvious, but they’re just as important for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 34.1 million people in the United States have diabetes. And while there isn’t a universal eating plan for managing this condition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends focusing on an overall balanced eating pattern, including limiting foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium. Here, dietitians explain why paying attention to saturated fat and sodium is important for managing blood sugar levels, along with other strategies for maintaining a balanced, diabetes-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention To Saturated Fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Saturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; are solid at room temperature. They’re typically found in animal-based foods, like cheese, butter, milk and meat, though they’re also found in plant-based oils, including coconut oil. While there’s some debate about whether all saturated fat is harmful, high intake of saturated fat has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease, a condition that people with diabetes are already at a higher risk for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to heart health, too much saturated fat may affect blood sugar levels by increasing the risk of insulin resistance, making it harder for glucose to move out of the bloodstream and into cells.&lt;a href="https://nutritiouslysimple.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle medicine dietitian, diabetes educator and founder at Nutritiously Simple, says, “Saturated fat, especially from meat and dairy, can increase insulin resistance, making it harder to manage glucose levels. Fat does not raise blood glucose directly the way carbohydrates do, but it can affect blood glucose in terms of digestion of food, insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturated fat also indirectly affects blood sugar levels thanks to its effects on insulin action. &lt;a href="https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, says, “Dietary fat profoundly impacts insulin action over time. In the short term, the initial insulin response is often slower and lower, but the total insulin needed may still be significant, depending on the fat type and amount.” This interaction is particularly important for people who take insulin to manage their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin recommends limiting saturated fat to 10% or less of daily calories. “For somebody consuming 1500 calories, that would be about 16 grams or less a day. Look at the nutrition facts label, and aim for saturated fat as close to zero as possible,” she says. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean you should limit all fat. Instead, opt for unsaturated fats when possible, including plant-based, whole-food sources like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. Fatty fish, like salmon, are also beneficial thanks to their rich concentration of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001058/best-healthy-fats-for-diabetes-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention to Sodium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you have other complications, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, people with diabetes are encouraged to limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day, which is the same guideline for healthy adults. While exceeding this amount won’t directly cause your blood sugar levels to spike, it can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), which is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the link between sodium and blood sugar levels. However, one study found that treatments focused on balancing sodium levels were linked with better recovery and survival odds in people hospitalized with hyperglycemia. To help prevent hypertension, focus on eating more minimally processed, low-sodium foods, especially ones that are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in potassium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is that foods high in sodium—like fast food, packaged snacks and fried foods—also tend to be high in saturated fat and low in fiber. “Highly processed, salty foods often contain refined carbs, and additives that [may] increase systemic inflammation and worsen insulin resistance. Choosing lower-sodium, whole food options supports both stable blood sugar and reduced inflammation,” says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Strategies to Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many factors affect blood sugar management, including overall eating patterns, exercise habits, sleep and stress management. Here are some tips for keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move Your Body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood sugar levels, including lowering hemoglobin A1C. Physical activity makes cells more sensitive to insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels up to 24 hours after activity. Find a type of activity you enjoy and commit to it. Start small and build your way up gradually. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk with your doctor first. Because exercise can lower blood sugar levels, your medication regimen may need to be adjusted to prevent your levels from dropping too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is an unavoidable, and sometimes necessary, part of life. However, being chronically stressed can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain. “Stress can have long-lasting glucose-raising effects,” says Plunkett. She adds that developing tools to help manage stress is key for supporting metabolic and mental health. “Focusing on deep breathing, sitting quietly device-free, changing your environment (even for a few minutes) or going for a walk can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood glucose and support overall metabolism,” says Plunkett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Work With a Professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for years, working with a diabetes professional is one of the best ways to help manage blood sugar levels. Working one-on-one with a professional can ensure that your treatment plan is tailored to your needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eat More Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber-rich foods are naturally low in fat and contribute to insulin sensitivity, particularly by decreasing inflammation. Higher fiber diets are well known for decreasing a person's risk of developing metabolic disease and lowering hemoglobin A1C levels (three-month average of blood sugar),” says Plunkett. Adding fiber to your meal can also help slow the absorption of sugar, minimizing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber is beneficial for weight loss and supports brain, gut and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans fall short of their daily fiber needs, which are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Luckily, adding more fiber to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. “Swap meat for legumes, like lentils, chickpeas or edamame. They are a great source of protein and fiber. This combination can assist in reducing inflammation, post-meal blood sugar spikes and improve gut health and insulin sensitivity,” says Levin. In addition to legumes, she recommends eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Specifically, Levin says that she encourages her clients to eat 30 different plant-based foods throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Factors To Consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, smoking habits and medication regimens are additional factors to consider when managing blood sugar levels. Technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, can also be helpful for tracking blood sugar levels and adjusting your treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to managing diabetes. Nutrients like fat, sodium and fiber also play a key role in keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Eating an overall balanced diet, with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods like vegetables and legumes, can help limit your intake of saturated fat and sodium while also increasing your intake of fiber and other essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for a long time, there are things you can do to manage your blood sugar. Focus on one change at a time and don’t hesitate to ask for help. To help make getting the help you need more affordable, consider reaching out to your insurance provider. Depending on your coverage, the costs of working with a diabetes expert may be fully or partially covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/two-surprising-nutrients-may-impact-blood-sugar-11718212" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5FY0FBTTRSX21YR2tWci1UMTJfWkt4enRiZ0F5ZndNR29YZXJsOWZpWmc2RWVVMm5KVlhVbkVpZnB2UHFLZUQ1akZCV2JvN291eHMwc3pIUWl4SVdKaWhxdlljbWdteE4zc0hlZ0RBZUVYYnN1MXg4</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，这两种令人惊讶的营养素可能会影响您的血糖- EatingWell | These 2 Surprising Nutrients May Impact Your Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPeWxXeDUtLUEtSjVRbXNIakZGcEZBRldYbXpLRF9OeExOYzhXRHJ2TUZsSkVIRDVjSFRwaXpPaU8zNVVwX25JRGgzenYxNmJIenRxdGlONjRTd0VSX2d5QlFsdl8zOWZ0YnFUd2NweEowREE0YWwxVTR1bUVUUTNCVUY4d3NoYjlDQmw4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

She adds that developing tools to help manage stress is key for supporting metabolic and mental health. “Focusing on deep breathing, sitting quietly device-free, changing your environment (even for a few minutes) or going for a walk can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood glucose and support overall metabolism,” says Plunkett.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for years, working with a diabetes professional is one of the best ways to help manage blood sugar levels. Working one-on-one with a professional can ensure that your treatment plan is tailored to your needs and lifestyle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat More Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber-rich foods are naturally low in fat and contribute to insulin sensitivity, particularly by decreasing inflammation. Higher fiber diets are well known for decreasing a person's risk of developing metabolic disease and lowering hemoglobin A1C levels (three-month average of blood sugar),” says Plunkett. Adding fiber to your meal can also help slow the absorption of sugar, minimizing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber is beneficial for weight loss and supports brain, gut and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most Americans fall short of their daily fiber needs, which are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, adding more fiber to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. “Swap meat for legumes, like lentils, chickpeas or edamame. They are a great source of protein and fiber. This combination can assist in reducing inflammation, post-meal blood sugar spikes and improve gut health and insulin sensitivity,” says Levin. In addition to legumes, she recommends eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Specifically, Levin says that she encourages her clients to eat 30 different plant-based foods throughout the week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep, smoking habits and medication regimens are additional factors to consider when managing blood sugar levels. Technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, can also be helpful for tracking blood sugar levels and adjusting your treatment plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to managing diabetes. Nutrients like fat, sodium and fiber also play a key role in keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Eating an overall balanced diet, with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods like vegetables and legumes, can help limit your intake of saturated fat and sodium while also increasing your intake of fiber and other essential nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you are newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for a long time, there are things you can do to manage your blood sugar. Focus on one change at a time and don’t hesitate to ask for help. To help make getting the help you need more affordable, consider reaching out to your insurance provider. Depending on your coverage, the costs of working with a diabetes expert may be fully or partially covered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Fast food chains are often just tasty indulgences offering a convenient way to grab a meal. But when the craving strikes and you want to get your hands on a greasy burger or handful of fries, sometimes you may want to strike a bit of a balance, health-wise, with your order. That's when it comes in handy to know which chains are sizzling up exactly what you're looking for when it comes to nutrition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a 2024 study conducted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplushcare.com%2Fblog%2Fmost-least-healthy-items-fast-food%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa64542959%2Fmost-unhealthy-fast-food-burger-america%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PlushCare;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;PlushCare&lt;/a&gt;, some fast food restaurants are much more unhealthy than others. Particularly Five Guys, which scored the number one spot in a ranking of the unhealthiest cheeseburgers, with a 50-point "unhealthiness score." Five Guys fries also weighed in as the unhealthiest, with 28 points on the score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whataburger, Smash Burger, and Carl's Jr. trailed behind in the ranking. Five Guys, however, had 73 percent more saturated fat than any other fast food cheeseburger on the list. That's...tough to swallow (literally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Courtesy of PlushCare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine scores, the site analyzed each menu item's calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium content based on the Department of Health's nutrient profiling method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, healthy eating comes down to taking control of what you eat," the online healthcare platform reported. "That might mean avoiding fast food altogether, but it can be as simple as making an informed decision about which &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a61039585/these-are-the-top-10-fast-food-chains-in-america/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food chains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt; to visit and which of their products to choose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burger King and McDonald's, somewhat shockingly, tied for second-lowest unhealthiness scores at just 18 points. Cheeseburgers from those chains pack a quarter of the saturated fat (a.k.a what leads to heart disease risk and weight gain) compared to a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19695099/best-burger-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cheeseburger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt; at Five Guys, and less than half of a Wendy's burger. The lowest was Culver's, coming in at 17 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the unhealthiest &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3305/chicken-sandwich-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chicken sandwich;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chicken sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, another coveted fast food menu item, Popeyes' beloved sammie scored 39 points, earning the title as unhealthiest, while McDonald's once again ranked as the healthiest. The McChicken had nearly half the unhealthiness points of Burger King (31 points) and KFC (27 points) with just 14. Ok, we see you Micky D's!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Courtesy of PlushCare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a caveat: while the McChicken is indeed health&lt;em&gt;ier&lt;/em&gt;, PlushCare points out that it doesn't necessarily make it a healthy sandwich. "While the McChicken is significantly less unhealthy than other &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64265239/best-fast-food-burger-fan-reactions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food&lt;/a&gt; chicken burgers, it is still high in sodium, fat, and calories. Because it is made of ground chicken patty, the nutrients it does contain are not high-quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a41983395/homemade-chicken-nuggets-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nugget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nugget&lt;/a&gt; lovers, you can rest easy knowing McDonald's beloved McNuggets were rated as the healthiest of all nugget options, solidifying their spot in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:44:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9rTGtQb1gtWnNDWWJWbGxXeGl3eEhESDk3Z2Vnb0pVcE5uQXk1VWZ6UWIyeWJNY0NwRG5QOXdJaHNaZU42R0d5NWNzSE5IaEtHM2pGQWhnNS0yd1V3OUlFbHhCb29YcmVUZzc4UVViZ25sY3ZI</guid></item><item><title>随着蜱虫季节的开始，另一种可传播的疾病即将来临： Powassan病毒- Star Tribune | As tick season starts, another transmittable illness looms: Powassan virus - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQajJvQUVJM1VFYTlrWUNZbGNlRzBGX0Z5M0VjSlJJVVljdkktd3NvUmJaTklucjRDMUpiSUlnWTlTRHhsbDFOUUYxRDQzNW4tT2hJOFJqSU1NQVpCX2wtWW1JWHBOTjVSQW1TUXlTblk0bU9jeGxMX2JBTlotUUNjdkpyNmo2Ty1LUE1raWY0QTdTQmluQ0VCblRFNlk5bVM2VVVaMkFtMmpqYklwQVdr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Ticks can spread Lyme disease and give people &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/lone-star-tick-bites-are-making-people-allergic-to-meat-but-minnesota-cases-are-a-mystery-cdc/600292959" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/lone-star-tick-bites-are-making-people-allergic-to-meat-but-minnesota-cases-are-a-mystery-cdc/600292959"&gt;red meat allergies&lt;/a&gt;, and now there’s increasing worry in Minnesota about another ailment spread by the blood-sucking pests: the Powassan virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;While the Powassan virus is uncommon compared to other tick-borne diseases in the state, it is among the most serious, said Elizabeth Schiffman, epidemiologist supervisor at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH).

Advances in treatment, early detection, and supportive care have played a big role in improving survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But deaths from melanoma and other skin cancers, as well as those of the mouth and pharynx, bones and joints, pancreas, uterus, and liver, are increasing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say several factors are to blame, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13404251/Obesity-linked-cancers-major-study.html"&gt;high rates of obesity&lt;/a&gt;, which drives pancreatic, uterine, and liver cancer-causing inflammation, hormone imbalances, and delayed or difficult diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An aging population also fuels cancers, such as those of the bones, pancreas, and liver, since older cells have had more time to accumulate DNA damage — and weaker immune systems make it harder to fight disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lack of access to early detection tools affects nearly all cancers, especially oral and skin cancers, which can often go unnoticed or misdiagnosed until later stages when treatment is more difficult, contributing to higher mortality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Increased deaths from liver, pancreas, uterine, bone, oral, and skin cancers are driven by high obesity rates, viral infections, an aging population, and limited access to early detection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the cancers with rising rates, symptoms often begin subtly, not prompting someone to seek medical care right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma, a serious skin cancer, often appears as a new or changing mole that may itch, bleed, or fail to fade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancers of the mouth and throat can cause persistent sores, swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, or unusual lumps. Bone and joint cancers frequently lead to worsening pain (especially at night), swelling, or unexpected fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer may cause upper abdominal pain, jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and eyes), and digestive issues. Liver and bile duct cancers typically cause jaundice, right-sided abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uterine cancer often reveals itself through abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these symptoms can have other causes, persistent or worsening signs warrant immediate medical attention for proper evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35833"&gt;Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;tracks new cancer cases, deaths, and trends in the US, using data from the NIH, CDC, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers drew from CDC programs and US Census data to account for demographic shifts and examined the impact of Covid, focusing on how the pandemic disrupted early detection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the death rates fell overall, certain cancers showed increases in mortality rates from 2018 to 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="14632737" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14632737/six-silent-cancers-quietly-surging-men-women-subtle-symptoms.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They analyzed monthly trends in eight cancers—mainly those typically caught through screenings or routine care—across multiple registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the state level, the researchers looked at how cancer rates where linked to how different states handled the pandemic with three specific factors: how strict the state’s Covid restrictions were, how many people died from Covid, and how much mammogram use changed from 2018 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States with more stringent Covid policies – like masking and school closures – experienced larger declines in cancer incidence, particularly for cancers like female breast, thyroid, and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These differences were minimal, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there was some correlation between the severity of Covid restrictions and cancer incidence declines, this geographic component did not fully explain the decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other factors like Covid death rates and changes in mammography utilization were also considered, but did not show a significant impact on the decline at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report showed death rates in men increased among cancers of the pancreas (0.3 percent per year), bones and joints (1.8 percent), oral cavity and pharynx (2.1 percent), and non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 percent) from 2018 to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This set of four US maps shows how the Covid pandemic may have affected cancer care. The first map shows where cancer diagnoses dropped the most from 2019 to 2020. The second shows how strict Covid policies were in each state. The third highlights areas with the highest Covid death rates. The fourth shows where breast cancer screenings (mammograms) declined the most between 2018 and 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women, death rates increased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (up 1.1 percent), corpus and uterus (1.1 percent), liver and intrahepatic bile duct (0.7 percent), and pancreas (0.2 percent) during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Progress in reducing cancer deaths overall is largely the result of declines in both incidence and death rates for lung cancer and several other smoking-related cancers, according to the NIH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diagnoses and deaths from lung cancer, for example, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-8620971/Lung-cancer-deaths-falling-nearly-5-year-2001-thanks-better-treatment.html"&gt;have declined&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women over the past 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report does not provide a specific explanation for why death rates for certain cancers rose, but &lt;span&gt;are likely linked to a combination of factors such as delays in early detection, limited advances in treatment, or the aggressive nature of these cancers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, tobacco use is a known contributor to oral cancer, while diet and obesity are known risk factors for cancers of all types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2001 to 2022, the cancer death rate among children from newborn to 14 dropped by 1.5 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Death rates for adolescents and young adults also declined until recently, when the decline slowed and stabilized, the NIH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood cancer incidence rate began to decrease by 0.8 percent per year starting in 2015 after increasing by 1.3 percent per year since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatric cancer care has made significant progress over the past few decades, including chemotherapy, surgeries, and targeted immunotherapies, causing survival rates to tick up.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, the rate of new cancer diagnoses was about eight percent lower than expected. This drop is attributed to pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare, which affected routine screenings, doctor visits, and access to healthcare services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates generally continued to decrease during the period 2018–2022, with an average annual decrease of 1.7 percent for men and 1.3 percent for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the pandemic may have influenced this trend, particularly in 2020, when diagnoses were likely delayed and cancers were detected at later stages when they are often harder to treat and have a lower survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found no evidence of data issues or reporting delays; the 2020 decline was real and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to men, the death rate from lung and bronchus cancer in women decreased the fastest, with an average annual drop of 3.4 percent from 2018 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US during the four years combined was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women. Rates among men declined from 2001 to 2013 and remained stable through 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers observed notable monthly trends in cancer incidence, specifically identifying decreases during certain months that were likely linked to reduced medical visits during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2001 to 2013, cancer rates in men dropped by about 1.6% to 2.2% each year, and then stayed steady through 2021. For women, cancer rates didn’t drop—instead, they rose slightly, going up by about 0.3% each year from 2003 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among women, rates have slowly risen since 2003; specifically, eight of the most common cancers, including breast, uterine, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. Stomach cancer had the steepest rise, particularly among Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among men, rates rose for cancers like prostate, pancreas, and testicular cancer but declined for lung, brain, and colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer had the sharpest increase, especially among API men, while lung cancer saw the most significant decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people had the highest overall cancer rates, followed by White and Black populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asian/Pacific Islander (API) people had the lowest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From 2018 to 2022, cancer deaths decreased for each major racial and ethnic population group,’ the NIH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-a0850b70-1ed0-11f0-a2fc-232d4df57398" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14632737/six-silent-cancers-quietly-surging-men-women-subtle-symptoms.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Leading deadly cancers: Know the signs &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma (a type of skin cancer) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New or changing mole (size, shape, color)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Itching, bleeding, or not healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral Cavity &amp;amp; Pharynx Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent mouth sore or pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble swallowing or hoarseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Lump in mouth or neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bone &amp;amp; Joint Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Bone or joint pain (often worse at night)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling or a lump&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Easy fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Jaundice (yellow skin/eyes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Weight loss, nausea, greasy stools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uterine (Corpus) Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Abnormal vaginal bleeding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver &amp;amp; Bile Duct Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Upper-right abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Swelling, weight loss, fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When it comes to absorption, digestive enzymes are crucial. “The best digestive enzymes, whether natural or in supplemental form, help ensure your food is properly broken down so your body can absorb the nutrients,” explains nutritionist and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://groundednourish.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://groundednourish.com/"}' href="https://groundednourish.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Grounded Nourishment&lt;/a&gt; Meg Gerber, RD, IFNCP, CGN.

Thorne delivers on all fronts—not only does it include a comprehensive blend of hydrochloric acid, pepsin, pancreatin, composed of amylase, lipase, and protease, and ox bile to ease digestive discomfort, but the brand also puts the formula through four rounds of testing to make sure it’s top tier in quality and performance. Especially brilliant to soothe bloat after meals heavy in fats or red meat, the brand also recommends it as a tool for those who’ve undergone gallbladder removal. The formula also doesn’t contain lactose, which is often used to dilute pepsin and pancreatin, so it’s an amazing option for those who are lactose intolerant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydrochloric acid, pepsin, pancreatin, and ox bile&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF certified, GMP certified, third-party tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 capsules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Servings:&lt;/strong&gt; 90&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the most common food sensitivities are lactose intolerance and gluten sensitivity. “Digestive enzyme supplements can make it possible for people who are lactose intolerant to tolerate, digest, and absorb nutrients in dairy products,” says Feller.

Shapiro also likes to recommend them for clients when traveling to help ease digestion when eating foods or at times they’re not accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="what" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Look for in a Digestive Enzyme Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deciding between digestive enzyme supplements, you ideally want a broad spectrum product that includes enzymes to break down all types of macronutrients, explains Gerber. “For example, amylase, lactase, sucrase, and maltase break down carbohydrates, proteases like pepsin and chymotrypsin help break down proteins, and lipase helps break down fats,” she says. “Some products contain extra lactase for those who are more dairy sensitive or a protease known as DPP-IV to help with those who are gluten sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="who" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who should take digestive enzymes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally people who struggle with any sort of digestion issue—IBS, bloating, fullness after meals, acid reflux, or stomach pain with certain foods—is an ideal candidate for digestive enzymes. “Aging, stress, and certain conditions like autoimmune diseases can also lead to suboptimal digestive enzyme output,” says Gerber. “Therefore taking enzymes with meals can be supportive.” It’s also worth noting that having a clear diagnosis of an intolerance or insufficiency that impairs the body’s ability to break down certain nutrients from a professional can help you distinguish the right digestive enzyme for your needs. “For example, dairy digest supplements and lactase enzymes may not be the same,” says Feller. “Some formulations have varying amounts of lactase so the digestive enzyme may or may not work as intended depending on the individual and how much dairy is consumed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="which" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is better: digestive enzymes or probiotics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both digestive enzymes and probiotics can support gut health because they work differently. However, if you’re someone who needs a digestive enzyme, a probiotic isn’t necessarily a swap because it doesn’t support the same activity. “Digestive enzymes work to break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to make them digestible and absorbable whereas probiotics don’t break down protein, fat, and carbohydrates,” says Feller. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284493/"&gt;Probiotics&lt;/a&gt; help to maintain beneficial bacteria in the gut, which can support the gut microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meg Gerber, RD, LDN, IFNCP, CGN, is a registered dietician, nutritionist, co-founder of digestive bitters brand &lt;a data-offer-url="https://livewithjuj.com/collections/digestive-bitters" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://livewithjuj.com/collections/digestive-bitters"}' href="https://livewithjuj.com/collections/digestive-bitters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;JÜJ&lt;/a&gt;, and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://groundednourish.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://groundednourish.com/"}' href="https://groundednourish.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Grounded Nourishment&lt;/a&gt;, a private functional nutrition practice in Austin, Texas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maya Feller, MS, RD, CDN, founder of Brooklyn-based &lt;a data-offer-url="http://mayafellernutrition.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://mayafellernutrition.com/"}' href="http://mayafellernutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Maya Feller Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, is a registered dietitian nutritionist, author of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Eating-Our-Roots-Home-Cooked-Favorites-ebook/dp/B09YQZNVVY" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3kFAWYpoG8awFdXg3DRy9i3F8X71emH9MqCzNSYw8DvmFPiNEQAw6pFGqWnUMaMW4BCivWaVjo7TPPAqHAsFbmnhV4V7PWuEygdLhceGgxFrt1f4fjpSDA861zJ7gBPqC5UhNS2rgSujJYjiq84MdmH4U3o9HvRPJSRqs6q5JdXitG8wHsJy3VAChS8WUYRQitbhd"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3kFAWYpoG8awFdXg3DRy9i3F8X71emH9MqCzNSYw8DvmFPiNEQAw6pFGqWnUMaMW4BCivWaVjo7TPPAqHAsFbmnhV4V7PWuEygdLhceGgxFrt1f4fjpSDA861zJ7gBPqC5UhNS2rgSujJYjiq84MdmH4U3o9HvRPJSRqs6q5JdXitG8wHsJy3VAChS8WUYRQitbhd" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites from Cultures Around the World&lt;/a&gt; and host of YouTube “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_DdOEnyk_qWEv6zOsVtTA?ybp=-gENeW91dHViZWJ1dHRvbg%3D%3D" target="_blank"&gt;Where Wellbeing Meets Flavor&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amy Shapiro MS, RD, CND is a registered dietician, nutritionist and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/"}' href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Real Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:29:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTFBEUGJpRmZKX0RPR0Y2YjdjXy1RNGh4TUZXMGxFRHB6QnJMbTg2U0dPUWFhR3M1dVIxTm14eUk4Z1puU2ptbUhpZEROTXE2dEVtcWwyUk1rSjFPQWdrOWdVRFFR</guid></item><item><title>在皮特县废水中检测到Mpox - WITN | Mpox detected in Pitt County wastewater - WITN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1CVTFybDhIMkRXUGhTYWo3dzM5Z29ZZXM1QmxZN2M3cFYtajJZMTR0aEd5MFBvcHlRdU1VaU41aEROTWF0QW5IcFhDeGItWnhRczFzb0hUbHo1MnY0Zm9jVWJqZDZlZXB4T3ItVS1kX1BRMTFsZDFFVtIBjAFBVV95cUxNTTViWmJIVUFLSmROMGdNeUhjNzJUcUVlUzdXNUVFQUc4akRGd1BuRThtMzNoUXctLWVwQnVVTENLYVV1T0JNaWxiZ3c4MlZqalNQeU04Y0ZkQjRMOHRDblZUSU5zRHZJYzA5d2ZVaDAteXR3aFhnZFpWVndmR0VsZ0ZJYXZxRXMtLVF3dQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;GREENVILLE, N.C.

And while health officials warn about the rise of multiple infections in Michigan this season, one illness has seen an alarming surge in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Severe &amp;amp; Highly Contagious Illness Cases Are Surging In Michigan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/What's_Going_Around/"&gt;health officials&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan have seen an increase in upper respiratory illnesses, such as those associated with seasonal allergies, one infection has sharply risen in cases. According to reports from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), officials have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/michigan-sees-1792-increase-in-whooping-cough-what-parents-should-know.html"&gt;1,792% increase&lt;/a&gt; in cases of this highly contagious and potentially deadly illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), Michigan has identified &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/pertussisupdates"&gt;497 cases of whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;, or pertussis, a respiratory infection that can cause coughing fits. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the cough may start like a common cold, with symptoms like a runny nose, nasal congestion, red eyes, fever, and cough. However, the coughing can become violent and rapid, and could cause vomiting. The coughing can last for days or even months and is called the '100-day cough'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough can cause serious illness in people of all ages, but it is most dangerous for babies and could be deadly. MDHHS urges residents that the pertussis vaccine is the best prevention against the infection. Treating whooping cough early with antibiotics may also make the infection less serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;10 Items Currently Recalled at Michigan Meijer Stores&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following items have been recalled due to various reasons.

Researchers found associations between memory performance and cardiovascular risk factors, immune markers, and Alzheimer’s biomarkers (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) in individuals aged 24–44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these early-life cognitive differences emerged even without clinical symptoms of decline. The findings suggest that prevention strategies should begin in young adulthood to effectively reduce long-term Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Onset Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s-linked biomarkers were associated with cognitive function in people as young as 24.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Risk Score:&lt;/strong&gt; The CAIDE score, which includes lifestyle and genetic risk factors, correlated with memory performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATN Biomarkers Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers were linked to cognition before midlife, though APOE risk was not yet apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer’s disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108927"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer’s disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to cognitive impairment in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet- Regional Health Americas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, research on Alzheimer’s disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older,” said Allison Aiello, PhD, James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer’s disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and blood biomarkers are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer’s risk factors—such as cardiovascular health, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994-1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70 percent (71.4–72.5%) were White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11, 449 individuals aged 24-34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34-44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews, were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for genetic testing. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50,” Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically — genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer’s disease risk in older populations. ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course,” Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer’s disease in the coming decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors are Jennifer Momkus, Chantel L.

We examined whether established risk factors and blood biomarkers are associated with cognition before midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) were analyzed. Participants were enrolled in 1994–95 (grades 7–12) and followed through 2018. We cross-sectionally analyzed weighted survey and biomarker data from Waves IV and V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score comprised of age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesteroal, and physical activity and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also measured total Tau and Neurofilament light (NfL), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Outcomes included immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analytic sample sizes ranged from 4507 to 11,449 participants in Wave IV and from 529 to 1121 participants in Wave V. The survey-weighted median (IQR) age was 28 (26–29) years in Wave IV and 38 (36–29) years in Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the survey-weighted Wave IV participants were female (48.4–52.1% across analytic samples), 71.4–72.5% were White, 12.5–14.9% were Black, and 9.3–10.2% were Hispanic. In Wave V, 43.6–46.8% were female, 68.7–69.3% were White, 17.1%–20.0% were Black, and 7.3%–9.6% were Hispanic. The CAIDE score was associated with all cognition measures in Wave IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, among adults aged 24–34, each 1-point increase in CAIDE was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation lower backward digit span score (95% CI: −0.04, −0.02). Total Tau was associated with immediate word recall in Wave V (β = −0.13, 95% CI: −0.23, −0.04). Wave IV hsCRP and IL-10 and Wave V IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 were also associated with lower cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease are linked to cognitive function as early as ages 24–44, highlighting the need for early prevention in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHP01HD31921, U01AG071448, U01AG071450, R01AG057800, P30AG066615, T32HD091058, P2CHD050924.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:09:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5JcTRFamxtZFd5WjhYNWg1ZjhhaDZpb0pES3FHR2xhVDFBcDAzN1d1djE4dWpUWUFwR3pTemhzQk1BcE5CTzViNTRPQ1R4dTd5M0FFWDRWMW1HMWpPMVMzTS1UVXNXejlkSzZVN0FDczd1Yzg</guid></item><item><title>突破性药物恢复视力：研究人员成功逆转视网膜损伤- SciTechDaily | Breakthrough Drug Restores Vision: Researchers Successfully Reverse Retinal Damage - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk</guid></item><item><title>高蛋白柠檬鸡ORZO - EatingWell | High-Protein Lemon Chicken Orzo - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTFBhclVfTUx0TFdUanRiRktCN2lFMlVHdklDZFQ0Yy1vSGdHLXVlTmlBUlNKZzl5S2pPT244MFRtSUxZdHhwckdxQ2pTQ2diWGpYb2tfZnEtdmRHbGJPcVpkY1lpM2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mm-recipes-intro__content_1-0" class="comp mm-recipes-intro__content mntl-sc-page mntl-block" data-sc-sticky-offset="190" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="1" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one-skillet &lt;strong&gt;Lemon Chicken Orzo&lt;/strong&gt; is the flavorful weeknight dinner you’ve been looking for.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Toasting the orzo enhances its flavor, adding a nutty richness that wouldn’t be achieved otherwise. Coating the orzo in oil also helps prevent it from sticking and allows for even cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To save time, consider using shredded rotisserie chicken and stirring it into the other ingredients at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can’t find whole-wheat orzo, regular or tricolor orzo would work well. You can also substitute chicken thighs or another cut of chicken, and including feta cheese would add some extra flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We recommend cooking in a cast-iron skillet, but you can also use a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet or sauté pan.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has identified an influenza virus circulating in pigs that shows multiple traits associated with pandemic potential. Known as H1N2, the virus belongs to a lineage of flu viruses that originated in birds, adapted to pigs, and has now been detected in humans. According to researchers, this strain—called 1C H1N2—has the ability to infect human airway cells, transmit between individuals, and escape most people’s existing immunity. These characteristics place it in a high-risk category under a pandemic risk framework published last year in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" aria-label="Nature Communications"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses are not exclusive to humans. They also infect birds, pigs, horses, and other animals. In pigs, three main subtypes circulate: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These viruses are further divided into genetic lineages based on their evolutionary history. The 1C lineage emerged in Europe in 1979, when an avian flu virus crossed into pigs and contributed genetic material to a new strain. Since then, the 1C lineage has remained largely confined to swine populations in Europe and Asia—until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2011 and 2024, viruses from the 1C lineage have been detected in humans at least 29 times, with almost half of those cases occurring since 2021. Most of these cases appear to be isolated spillover events from pigs, but their increasing frequency is cause for concern. Surveillance data also suggest that individuals who work with pigs are more likely to have been exposed to these viruses, underscoring the potential for transmission at the human–animal interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 influenza have been increasing since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings from the new study is how little immunity most people have to the 1C H1N2 virus. In blood samples collected from U.S. adults, only about one-third showed any detectable neutralizing antibodies, and most of those were from individuals born before 1950. This limited protection appears to stem from residual immunity to the 1918-like viruses that circulated early in the 20th century. More recent generations show almost no immune recognition of 1C H1N2. Current seasonal flu vaccines also offer little to no cross-protection, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laboratory tests, the 1C H1N2 virus displayed several traits associated with the ability to spread among humans. Like the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, it binds preferentially to receptors found in the human upper respiratory tract—an important trait for human-to-human transmission. It replicated efficiently in cultured human airway cells and remained stable in aerosol-like droplets across a range of humidity levels, mimicking the conditions respiratory viruses encounter in real-world settings. The virus also showed high neuraminidase activity, a feature that has been linked to increased transmissibility. Neuraminidase is a key protein on the virus’s surface that helps it escape from infected cells to infect new cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the virus’s ability to cross species, researchers conducted transmission experiments using pigs and ferrets—a standard model for studying influenza in humans. Infected pigs were housed near uninfected ferrets with no direct contact. While the ferrets showed no symptoms, all of them developed antibodies against the virus after exposure, indicating successful transmission. Notably, even ferrets that had prior immunity to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain became infected, suggesting that existing human immunity may not prevent spread of the 1C virus if it were to emerge more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 have appeared in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the pandemic risk assessment framework, viruses that exhibit a specific set of traits should be prioritized for surveillance. The 1C H1N2 virus checks nearly every box. It evades existing immunity in most people, binds to human-type airway receptors, and replicates efficiently in human bronchial cells. It remains stable in airborne droplets under typical humidity conditions and has a low pH of fusion—meaning its surface proteins can undergo the necessary changes for cell entry within the acidic compartments of human airway cells. In animal studies, it transmitted through the air both to naïve ferrets and to those with prior immunity to the H1N1 strain responsible for the 2009 pandemic. Taken together, these features place 1C H1N2 among the highest-risk flu viruses currently circulating in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that meeting the biological criteria for pandemic risk does not guarantee a severe outcome. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus also spread widely and met many of the same risk thresholds, but caused relatively mild illness in most cases. That experience was a reminder that pandemics can vary in severity—and that a virus can be highly transmissible without being highly lethal. The current study does not evaluate how deadly the 1C H1N2 virus might be. In fact, infections in pigs were mild, and the virus is not classified as a highly pathogenic strain like the H5N1 avian flu currently circulating in U.S. dairy herds and poultry. Still, the ability to spread efficiently in humans—especially when combined with low levels of immunity—makes early detection and risk assessment essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of 1C H1N2 underscores the importance of both structured risk assessment and detailed experimental investigation. In this case, researchers combined serology, molecular virology, and animal models to evaluate a virus that would otherwise remain hidden in the background of routine surveillance. Their work demonstrates how careful, labor-intensive studies can bring clarity to potential threats before they escalate. While it remains uncertain whether this virus will ever spread widely in humans—or how severe it might be if it does—this study provides a strong scientific basis for keeping it on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

The study identifies tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene as a shared mechanism that disrupts gene splicing and contributes to ASD-like social behaviors in individuals with DM1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mis-splicing creates protein imbalances that interfere with brain development and function.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;DM1 is an inherited condition which causes progressive muscle loss and weakness. While ASD is present in around one per cent of the general population, it is 14 times more likely to develop in people with DM1.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that the genetic variation that causes DM1 — tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene — also impacts brain development. The research team found that the effects of TREs interfere with a critical process called gene splicing, which is essential for gene function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disruption causes a protein imbalance that can result in mis-splicing of multiple genes involved in brain function, and may explain why some of the social and behavioural outcomes of ASD develop in people with DM1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism,” explains Dr. Ryan Yuen, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are TREs? &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;TREs occur when sections of a DNA strand are repeated two or more times, and the likelihood of those repeats causing errors in gene function increases each time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Yuen discovered that TREs are genetic contributors to autism, identifying more than 2,588 different places in the genome where TREs were much more prevalent in people with ASD. Similarly, people with DM1 have a TRE in the DMPK gene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease,” says Dr. Łukasz Sznajder, a research lead and Assistant Professor at UNLV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gene splicing a key contributor to the development of ASD &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the tandem repeat expands in the DMPK gene, the research team, including collaborators at the University of Florida and Adam Mickiewicz University (Poland), found its altered RNA binds to a protein that is involved in gene splicing regulation during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called “toxic RNA” depletes the protein and prevents it from binding to other RNA molecules in important areas of the genome, causing a protein imbalance which results in mis-splicing other genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly,” explains Yuen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yuen Lab and Sznajder Lab are already exploring whether this mis-splicing is happening in other genes associated with ASD, as well as how their findings could inform precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this work is already underway. In 2020, Dr. Christopher Pearson, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids, identified a molecule that can contract TREs in Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to identify how this could be applied to other conditions, the team remains optimistic their findings could inform future research and care for DM1, ASD and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Azrieli Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy Association, the UNVL startup fund, the University of Florida Centre for Autism and Neurodevelopment, the National Science Centre, Poland, SickKids Research Institute, Brain Canada, the Government of Ontario, the University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), The Petroff Family Foundation, Tribute Communities, The Marigold Foundation and SickKids Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Autism and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed8b9f8c838e889e8e8cc39d8c86ad9e848e868684899ec38e8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Francesca Pak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sickkids.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Yuen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide enrichment of gene-specific tandem repeat expansions has been linked to autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mutation is the CTG tandem repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt; gene, which is known to cause myotonic muscular dystrophy type 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there is a clear clinical association between autism and myotonic dystrophy, the molecular basis for this connection remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that sequestration of MBNL splicing factors by mutant DMPK RNAs with expanded CUG repeats alters the RNA splicing patterns of autism-risk genes during brain development, particularly a class of autism-relevant microexons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that both &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt;-CTG expansion and &lt;em&gt;Mbnl&lt;/em&gt; null mouse models recapitulate autism-relevant mis-splicing profiles, along with social behavioral deficits and altered responses to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support our model that myotonic dystrophy-associated autism arises from developmental mis-splicing of autism-risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE51d0xvNmdCLWZGWWtwc0NIV0xqZ05TTVJRdUNSbzh3eWpjTVVXMW93UEJwdTNzV2p4QVV0dnR1Vk1xUUZHRXpicjdqWEdON3lmXzFOaGJfa3lGUTE4WnhobWRB</guid></item><item><title>由营养师制定的7天高蛋白地中海饮食计划，帮助减掉内脏脂肪- EatingWell | 7-Day High-Protein Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan to Help Lose Visceral Fat, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxORS1hblAwNjNmX1F3eXJyeFRHdkt5N2tOaUY1azltUjhrYkRNSEJ3aEN3dGM5dnZXY2RkTHlNM0ROWmRxRlhFcnJwMDA1RUFXdVZodERXWE1OcmFRS1V6WmN6VFV4TVNvTTdhcGVsYU9DbE1JdWxnR0lmczA5ZkVSN2tVWUlMR3F6ZGt1N0VJWkpiX3RBWE5BSHR6MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different meal in this list or browse more of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we chose recipes with total daily calories, protein and fiber in mind, it may be helpful to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile or plan to adjust a snack or two, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, go for it! Each breakfast option spans 352 to 409 calories while lunches range from 314 to 410 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to make small adjustments to snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is visceral fat?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat refers to fat around the abdominal region. It can surround internal organs and increase the risk of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is also linked to an increase in inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_171-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4274/mediterranean-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is a popular way of eating that emphasizes protein, legumes, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats. It limits refined grains, ultra-processed foods and added sugars. This eating style is often praised for its flexibility, health benefits and nutritional quality—but does it help with weight loss? Research points to the Mediterranean diet as an effective strategy for both weight loss and a reduced risk for gaining weight over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you can’t necessarily &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;target specific areas for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, reducing total body fat can often lead to a reduction in visceral fat. Because of its focus on whole grains, beans, lentils and ample produce, the Mediterranean diet tends to be high in fiber. Fiber is an important nutrient with many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; and research shows that it can have benefits for weight loss as well.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the Mediterranean diet does not restrict any particular food groups, which means it’s likely more sustainable long-term.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can be a double-edged sword, especially for very young kids. Recent research has found evidence that frequent antibiotic use can raise children’s risk of childhood asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Rutgers University led the research, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf191/8114163"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study found that children given antibiotics before the age of two were noticeably more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and allergies later on, particularly the more antibiotics they took. The findings are the latest to suggest that antibiotics should be carefully managed in their use, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are our best weapon against bacterial infections. But scientists have known for decades that they don’t come without risks. Bacteria have steadily learned how to resist these drugs, for instance, and antibiotic resistance is now one of the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;most pressing public health issues&lt;/a&gt; of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another risk concerns the microbiome, the neighborhood of usually harmless and often helpful bacteria that live in or on our bodies. Many antibiotics are broad-spectrum, meaning they can kill a wide variety of bacteria, including these friendly bacteria. The splash damage caused by antibiotics might then &lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/what-happens-to-the-gut-microbiome-after-taking-antibiotics-69970"&gt;disturb the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could increase our risk of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some research has suggested that antibiotic-triggered disruptions of the microbiome are even more harmful to children, with studies linking their use to chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10142236/"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;. But according to the Rutgers researchers, past studies had limitations—such as small sample sizes and numerous variables to account for—issues they tried to minimize in their new study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the medical records of over one million children born in the UK. They also conducted a separate analysis of children and their siblings, allowing them to compare children with similar environmental and genetic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that antibiotic use before age two was positively linked to a higher risk of asthma, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). They also found a possible association between antibiotic use and intellectual disability in general. On the positive side, they failed to find any connection between antibiotics and most other conditions they looked for, including autism spectrum disorder, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research can’t prove that antibiotics are triggering asthma in some young children, it can only suggest a correlation. But the researchers did see a higher risk of asthma in children who took more antibiotics than others, which is evidence of a dose-response effect. The same pattern was also seen when the researchers only compared children to their siblings, further strengthening a causative link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown that antibiotics are frequently prescribed when they shouldn’t be, such as for infections likely not caused by bacteria—a problem in children as well. A study in 2020, for instance, found that one of every four children given antibiotics in hospitals likely &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/1-in-4-kids-who-get-antibiotics-in-childrens-hospitals-are-prescribed-the-drugs-incorrectly/"&gt;didn’t need&lt;/a&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So while further research might be warranted to confirm these links between antibiotics and certain chronic childhood conditions like asthma, the take-home message should remain the same: We need to rein in our use of these vital, but not risk-free, medications, perhaps even more so in kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics are important and sometimes life-saving medicines, but not all infections in young kids need to be treated with antibiotics,” said lead author Daniel Horton, an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers School of Public Health, in a &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/frequent-use-antibiotics-infants-and-young-children-may-increase-risk-asthma-allergies-and"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “Parents should continue to consult with their children’s doctors on the best course of care.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Conducted with nearly 900 parents, the research found that while both emotions were beneficial, awe had a stronger impact on psychological richness and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, offering a sense of wonder that slows time and deepens emotional connection. These findings suggest that everyday moments with children—not just major milestones—can offer profound emotional rewards that help buffer the mental health challenges of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe improves well-being more holistically than pride by enhancing life meaning and emotional richness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe can make time feel slower, helping parents immerse fully in special moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe doesn’t require rare events—it can arise from everyday interactions like outings or shared joy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from the University of Rochester suggests that experiencing feelings of pride and awe toward one’s children can significantly enhance parental well-being. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which will be published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;, found that these positive emotions contribute to greater life satisfaction and stronger parent-child bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108919"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a parent and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Princeton Chee, conducted a series of studies involving nearly 900 parents to examine how parental pride and awe affect various aspects of well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parental pride and awe are common and beneficial feelings parents can have with their children,” explains Chee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents may feel proud when their child does something they worked hard to succeed in and accomplish. They may feel awe when their child does something amazing or completely unexpected that make them feel like saying ‘woah’ or ‘wow.'” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both emotions proved beneficial, the research showed that awe had more profound effects on overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that awe can actually strengthen parental well-being more broadly and holistically, compared to pride, making parents lives feel happier, more meaningful, and richer in experiences,” Chee notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, such as the parent-child relationship or the concept of parenthood itself, while pride tends to focus more on personal ego and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction helps explain why awe showed stronger associations with purpose, meaning, and psychological richness in parents’ lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly noteworthy was the finding that awe can alter parents’ perception of time. “Awe in particular can help parents fully immerse themselves by making time feel like it’s slowing down during extraordinary moments,” says Chee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research appears especially relevant amid growing concerns about parental mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents everywhere are struggling with mental health and well-being, with even the US surgeon general calling for an urgent need to better support parents,” Chee points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research finds that one way in which parenthood can be rewarding, rather than detrimental, is through feeling pride and especially awe with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, experiencing parental awe doesn’t require rare or exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awe may be easier to find and cultivate than you might think,” Chee explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be only once in a lifetime, extraordinary experiences in which parents feel awe. These certainly are rewarding moments that elicit awe, but awe, along with its many rewards, can also be cultivated through things as simple as weekend outings and quality time spent with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Rather, the findings suggest that cultivating and savoring moments of pride and awe can help parents find greater joy, meaning, and richness in the parenting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this parenting and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196a6e78757d6b7677596a696a6937766b7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephen Waldron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spsp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephen Waldron – Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19485506251332690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;” by Princeton Chee et al. &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenthood is challenging but fulfilling. We examined how parental pride and awe may enhance various aspects of well-being across cross-sectional (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 505), longitudinal (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 130), and experimental (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 261) studies, along with an internal meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thematic analyses suggested similar yet unique frequencies and underpinnings of pride (child growth, talent, resilience, and good behavior) and awe (child love/kindness, growth, talent, and shared moments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, we found that pride predicted greater pleasure (i.e., high satisfaction and low negative affect), and awe predicted greater pleasure, purpose (i.e., meaning), and variety (i.e., psychological richness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that strengthened relationship quality with a child, self-transcendence (for pride and awe), and slowed time perception (for awe) served as mechanisms for these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these rewards were consistent across parent and child characteristics and could not be explained by child temperament or other positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate how pride and awe can make parenting bright, meaningful, and rich.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:08:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1ucjI2dWVEUTkxSGRTUkl6RlNCVmwxM1hYaE42YTNMNGp2c25mbzlIUVA1OFdzYzNPaE9mNWVkSTlaWlAxRGNRcWVZcTRRZTFYX3F6SU41WTR0WXBoeF9hZDF2QlJRdVVqbWw1VGJiOHV1V1pjbl9JZQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D可能在降低结直肠癌风险方面发挥重要作用，研究发现-《财富》 | Vitamin D may play a big role in lowering colorectal cancer risk, study finds - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaU9xQTNkNUZuUk4wV1Vrc0tCQ3Y1SFJrOGpsLWF4NFRXWmNzT2R3VzRRNjIyajVucFRkMmoteEE2TlNWRXpfQ2FiR1VmcjE1NkloRDhKWUwyR2NIOXAyRVJ6X0c1bXdsNGxud2NGZlUzcGxIWmF1MUY3NEF1TmJKekgxaFBVbGJLbHdKWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaU9xQTNkNUZuUk4wV1Vrc0tCQ3Y1SFJrOGpsLWF4NFRXWmNzT2R3VzRRNjIyajVucFRkMmoteEE2TlNWRXpfQ2FiR1VmcjE1NkloRDhKWUwyR2NIOXAyRVJ6X0c1bXdsNGxud2NGZlUzcGxIWmF1MUY3NEF1TmJKekgxaFBVbGJLbHdKWQ</guid></item><item><title>呼吸空气的安全性如何？美国有5000万人不知道- Phys.org | How safe is the air to breathe? 50 million people in the US don't know - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9lRzVOZkxwTzN2WTEtSXVoWFpkVFZwTmpOZGtBMlhSTXBzVW5TaHFsb0g1aFlSUUVwVDFEUHpTbU9YQ0NpSkFELXQ3aXZEeFVzenlLSUM3RG43eGRpY0VvNndEaWdtUDktaUxHVWJlblHSAW9BVV95cUxPQk41UmQzWHdzTU9sWVBRMTJaRC1rckpTWEJfNGtOYXBjczF1eEJFRXMyTG5EUkFwNzNNaDhpRTNXcDFiTHFXUUtZUXQyYkpSRnhxZEtCd1otWm5qS2FNVFItb2JCb2dMd05NR0FQeVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, more than 50 million people in the United States lived in counties with no air-quality monitoring, according to a new study from researchers in the Penn State College of Health and Human Development.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Rural counties—especially counties in the Midwest and South—were less likely to have an air-quality monitoring site. Air quality measures are used to estimate people's exposure to air pollution, which makes monitoring a critical public health tool, according to Nelson Roque, assistant professor of human development and family studies and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425310122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today (April 21) in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, the researchers examined where air quality is not monitored and which demographic and social factors were more common in unmonitored counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exposure to air pollution has been directly and indirectly to cancers, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory disease, immune disorders and more," said Alexis Santos, associate professor of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/family+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;family studies&lt;/a&gt; and of demography at Penn State and co-author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we are not measuring air quality in large regions of the country, then we do not know how significant air pollution problems are. For example, if there is wildfire in a county with no air quality monitoring site, how will people know whether it is safe to sleep in their homes or work at their places of business?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/active+sites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;active sites&lt;/a&gt; directory. They found that 1,848 counties in the U.S.—58% of all counties—have no active air-quality monitoring sites. Per-state monitoring varies greatly across the nation. Pennsylvania, for example, ranks in the top 15 states with 67% of the counties having at least one air-quality monitoring site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By matching their data with information from the American Community Survey produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, the researchers were able to use &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/logistic+regression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;logistic regression&lt;/a&gt;—a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/statistical+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;statistical model&lt;/a&gt; that uses available data to predict outcomes with two options—to identify which demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are more common in counties without air-quality monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that rural counties were the most likely to lack monitoring sites. Additionally, when taking population size into account, the researchers found that counties without air-quality monitoring had higher levels of poverty, lower levels of high school completion, higher proportions of Hispanic residents and higher proportions of Black residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Air pollution affects everyone's health, so it is important for everyone in the nation to have access to accurate information about the quality of the air they breathe," said Roque. "Where we don't collect data, the threat and impact of pollution are invisible."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The nation had 4,821 active air-quality monitoring stations when the analysis was conducted, but the researchers said that the number of sites is always changing. Some monitoring sites are several decades old and frequently go offline. Between 1957—when national air-quality monitoring began—and September 2024—when this study was conducted—20,815 air quality sites had been active at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We ran this same analysis just a couple months apart, and we found that the number of air-quality monitoring sites had changed over that short period of time," Roque said. "These stations are in flux all the time, and data-reporting intervals also vary, which points to the need for investment in and modernization of this infrastructure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air quality data is primarily gathered by the EPA or by localities in conjunction with the EPA, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Generally speaking, infrastructure for health care, transportation, education and other areas are underdeveloped in rural counties," said Santos. "This study demonstrated the pattern holds true for air-quality monitoring, as well. This leaves people in rural areas vulnerable to increased exposure to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/air+pollution/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; from wildfires, agriculture, industrial activities and other sources. As a society, we need to invest in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/air+quality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;air-quality&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/monitoring/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;monitoring&lt;/a&gt; if we want to keep people safe and save on the long-term costs of pollution exposure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hailey Andrews, human research technologist in the Penn State Center for Healthy Aging, also contributed to this research.&lt;/p&gt;

He’d double over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tests revealed that Joe had pertussis, a bacterial infection. It’s also called whooping cough because of the sound some kids make during the coughing fits that Joe experienced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The constant hacking is exhausting and sometimes life-threatening, doctors say, especially for small children and babies with tiny airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re unable to catch their breath,” said Dr. Sapna Singh of Texas Children’s Pediatrics near Houston. “They’re fighting for air. They’re fighting to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The virulent cough is unparalleled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had a patient this year who broke two ribs coughing,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We had an infant who coughed so hard that they ended up with a pneumothorax,” also known as a collapsed lung. “That’s essentially when your lung pokes a hole out of itself and air starts collecting outside the lung.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why whooping cough is making a comeback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data&lt;/a&gt;, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Michigan, where the Moor family lives, whooping cough cases have skyrocketed. There were 110 cases in the state in 2023, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/pertussisupdates" target="_blank"&gt; state’s department of health&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, 2,081 cases were reported — a nearly 1,800% increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The state’s on track to meet or exceed last year’s number. In 2025, 497 whooping cough cases have been reported in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Louisiana, two young infants died of pertussis within the last six months, the state's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;urgeon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;eneral posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March.

A new study with the largest dataset of its kind has identified distinct brain activity patterns that separate lucid dreaming from both REM sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research reveals unique shifts in perception, memory, and self-awareness that occur during this rare conscious state within sleep.

During initial LD eye signaling compared to baseline, source-level gamma1 power (30-36 Hz) increased in right temporo-occipital regions, including the right precuneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased inter-hemispheric and inter-regional gamma1 connectivity during LD, reflecting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that distinct source-level power and connectivity patterns characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying LD, including shifts in network communication and regional activation that may underlie the specific changes in perception, memory processing, self-awareness, and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:29:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1tSGZHeVVyMkhoU0k2bVVya3BOV2NudEgxSnh1d3MySUY4RmNIWXBWTHBmcmwzanI4VGpWRnZSa3h4RnFkU25nY2NONHk1R3pqRnlCdHFtZ1BWRFJDMjUwY2l2aHF5Q3hiTWZfZC1sd0hWUQ</guid></item><item><title>高科技贴纸可以识别真实的人类情感- Phys.org | High-tech sticker can identify real human emotions - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5heFlJUHVfSEp3ZnJMQVhKOUJqZ0o3VmJJN2FKX1g0M2tuWUFzZWtMTjF5YXE4VTdVNFNmbC1LNnpfQzEyQWZkd1RMVkNTaTE0LWFnY0lVNzZ3cWk2NzdMb01IN2V0LVRkUGlXVjVaYl_SAW9BVV95cUxQcXd6U3JSc2h0cVU0OGtQNlcxSHl3N0tNTVkzQ2dTUHRCcE00UGpmSUtqY3lxN3hDWjlwRDFyZWIweGJBZ3NUNmw3WkVoM0FzaVFXV2xPU3BReTRWbndnRkduMGJoQ0pOTUNnOTkzYW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying one thing while feeling another is part of being human, but bottling up emotions can have serious psychological consequences, such as anxiety or panic attacks. To help health care providers tell the difference, a team led by scientists at Penn State has created a stretchable, rechargeable sticker that can detect real emotions—by measuring things like skin temperature and heart rate—even when users put on a brave face.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The researchers recently unveiled the wearable patch that can simultaneously and accurately track multiple emotional signals in a study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c06392" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nano Letters&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new and improved way to understand our emotions by looking at multiple body signals at once," said Huanyu "Larry" Cheng, the James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State and lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Relying only on facial expressions to understand emotions can be misleading. People often don't visibly show how they truly feel, so that's why we're combining facial expression analysis with other important physiological signals, which will ultimately lead to better mental health monitoring and support."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sticker-like patch tracks a range of physiological responses, such as skin temperature, humidity, heart rate and blood oxygen levels, that are associated with emotional states. Most importantly, Cheng explained, the device's sensors are designed to work independently, minimizing any interference between the different measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device combines its analysis of the physiological signals with facial expression data to better distinguish between genuine emotions and acted ones. It then wirelessly transmits the real-time measured data to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mobile+devices/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; and the cloud, where clinicians could potentially use it to better assess patients virtually. The device does not record &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/personal+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;personal information&lt;/a&gt;, only signals, Cheng explained, meaning personal privacy is protected through the device's design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This technology has the potential to help people who are struggling with their mental health, but maybe aren't being fully honest with others or even themselves about how much they are struggling," said Yangbo Yuan, co-author of the paper and doctoral student at Penn State studying engineering science and mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Cheng explained that the collected data could also help bridge cultural or social gaps, which can manifest as a person appearing more stoic or expressive to their &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+care+providers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care providers&lt;/a&gt;: "By keeping track of these signals, it could be possible to detect problems like anxiety or depression earlier in its progression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built the stretchy, Band-Aid-sized device by folding together thin layers of flexible metals like platinum and gold and cutting them into wave-like shapes that maintain sensitivity even when pulled or twisted. They also used layers of materials that change the flow of electrical current with temperature and built in hollow tubes made of carbon atoms, which absorb water and track humidity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiple sensors were designed and placed on the device in such a way that they would not interfere with each other's measurements. For example, the researchers put a rigid layer under the temperature and humidity sensors to protect them from the stretching that the facial expression sensors would experience. They also used a waterproof layer to protect the temperature and strain sensors from humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've engineered this device to measure these different signals independently, without them interfering with each other, providing a much clearer and more accurate picture of what's happening beneath the surface," said Libo Gao, co-corresponding author on the paper and associate professor at Xiamen University.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Next, the team trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model to read and understand signs of performed and real human emotions. The researchers recruited eight people, a common sample size for pilot studies, to perform six common facial expressions: happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, anger and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;figcaption class="text-left text-darken text-truncate text-low-up mt-3"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants displayed each emotional expression 100 times while the device tracked their movement. The researchers then fed this data to an AI model, training it to correlate specific facial movements with different emotions. They then recruited an additional three participants to further evaluate the model's abilities. It classified performed &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/facial+expressions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;facial expressions&lt;/a&gt; with 96.28% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to tracking real emotions, the researchers tested how well the device tracked the psychological responses of the same participants as they watched video clips designed to elicit emotions. The device correctly identified emotions with 88.83% accuracy, with the sensors confirming that the psychological responses were consistent with known links between emotions and psychological reactions, such as increases in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/skin+temperature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skin temperature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/heart+rate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; during surprise and anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng noted that the ability to wirelessly transmit the data means that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+care+professionals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care professionals&lt;/a&gt; could potentially monitor individuals remotely and provide timely emotional support through telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This sensor can serve a vital function in bridging gaps in access to care," he said. "Given the rising stress levels in modern society, the ability to monitor emotions can provide early indicators of debilitating conditions and allow for proactive support."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the device also opens the door for other systems for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI)-powered disease diagnostics and therapeutics beyond just emotion recognition. He noted there may be potential applications for clinicians to better understand the mental and emotional state of non-verbal patients, better identify behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and recognize opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology could one day even be used for chronic wound monitoring and disease management, he added, as well as track neurodegenerative disease progression and athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While still in the research and development phase, this device is a significant step forward in our ability to monitor and understand human emotions, potentially paving the way for more proactive and personalized approaches to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; care," Cheng said.&lt;/p&gt;

When her condition didn't improve, she was transferred to Children's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on April 13, where she was diagnosed as having encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the girl has an underlying heart condition and had surgery for a ventricular septal defect when she was 2 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymerase chain reaction tests on her respiratory samples were negative for H5 avian flu, but her cerebrospinal fluid sample was positive for the virus, with results confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient remains hospitalized on a ventilator with stable vital signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epidemiologic investigation found that, before she got sick, the child had contact with a poultry flock at her grandmother's house that had experienced mass deaths 2 weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Earlier report described meningitis presentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said H5N1 infections that involve only the central nervous system are rare but have been reported before, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa044307"&gt;2004 in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; when clinicians identified H5N1 in the cerebrospinal one of two siblings who died within weeks of each other from severe neurologic symptoms, but without respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the illness spectrum is wider than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam reported its last human H5 case in &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-human-h5-avian-flu-case"&gt;December 2024&lt;/a&gt;, which involved an 18-year-old man from Long An province who was exposed to sick poultry and died from his infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear which H5N1 clade infected the girl, but in 2024 scientists warned of an H5N1 reassortant circulating across the Greater Mekong region that has infected both birds and people. It contains surface proteins of an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) that has circulated in parts of Asia with a newer clade (2.3.4.4b) that has circulated globally since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There's sun one day, and then wind and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/our-best-tips-to-protect-your-smart-home-tech-in-the-snow-and-rain/" target="_self"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; rush in the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;If you're &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3166406/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; deficient or just need a boost without using &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, check out these foods that are rich in vitamin D. The benefits of vitamin D stem from supporting &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-muscle-building-foods/" target="_self"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/pack-your-diet-with-these-12-brain-healthy-foods-for-a-mental-boost/" target="_self"&gt;neurological&lt;/a&gt; health to helping with calcium absorption in the bones and, most importantly, serving as a great defender against attacks on your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-immunity-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods high in vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of vitamin D can vary depending on the fish you use. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698592/" target="_self"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found farmed salmon had 25% of the vitamin D content as found in wild-caught salmon. As such, if you're getting vitamin D from fish sources, try to opt for wild-caught fish instead of farmed-raised fish. The USDA says sockeye salmon has an average of 670 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swordfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fatty fish that is an excellent source of vitamin D is the swordfish. The USDA lists a 100-gram serving as having 666 IU of vitamin D. That's more than the 600 IU daily recommendation for people ages 1 to 70 years old, so cooking up some swordfish for dinner may help you easily meet your vitamin D needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tuna&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lunchtime staple can also pack a vitamin D punch. While not as high as salmon or swordfish, fresh yellowfin tuna still contains 82 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. It can be a food to include as part of an overall diet in vitamin D rich foods. However, bluefin tuna has 227 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, so check which type of tuna you're eating as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Egg yolks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As listed by the USDA, one whole egg yolk packs a whopping 218 IU in vitamin D. Simply making a frittata or some scrambled eggs in the morning with two eggs could give you a 436-IU boost of vitamin D. That's a good way to start off any morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Orange juice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While oranges are more known for their vitamin C, orange juice often comes fortified with added vitamin D to help boost our health. Check the label on your orange juice to see if it has been fortified with vitamin D. One study found that both vitamin D2 and D3 are as equally &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869510/" target="_self"&gt;bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; in orange juice as taking vitamin D capsules, meaning the body can still absorb the vitamins well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified milk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk is another drink that is often fortified with vitamin D to help us get this valuable nutrient. Like orange juice, milk is not a natural source of vitamin D, but the FDA allows &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/vitamin-d-milk-and-milk-alternatives" target="_self"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to voluntarily add up to 84 IU of vitamin D3 per 100 grams of milk and 84 IU per 100 grams of D2 to plant-based milk alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified cereal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good way to access vitamin D is to choose cereals that have been fortified with it. There are a wide variety of cereals that all add vitamin D. You simply need to check the label of what you are buying. The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-d/art-20363792" target="_self"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; lists fortified cereal as a good source of Vitamin D. You might look for more healthy brands of cereal, such as whole grain options, which are more likely to fortify with higher levels of Vitamin D and be better for you overall. Try to avoid highly sugary cereals with fewer nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beef liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver is a love-it-or-hate-it food, but if you like beef liver, it's another good way to get vitamin D. You can either cook it up, popular with onions, or liver sausage can be a good source of vitamin D. According to the USDA, pan-fried cooked beef liver has 40 IU of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/usdandb/VitaminD-Content.pdf" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; in a single slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sardines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another food people either really love or really hate. However, if you're a sardine fan, sardines have a higher amount of vitamin D as well. The USDA says 100 grams of canned sardines have 193 IU of vitamin D. Enjoy sardines on some crackers or add them to your favorite pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Herring &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring is another type of fatty fish that is popular to eat out of a jar and on crackers, or you can cook it up for dinner. Herring boasts 214 IU of vitamin D for a 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. In fact, herring is a popular food to eat around the holidays in the Midwest. During the cold and darker months, it's a convenient and popular holiday food, and it boasts fairly high vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wild Mushrooms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for vitamin D that doesn't come from an animal source, mushrooms are perfect. Just like us, mushrooms create &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d#6.-Mushrooms" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to UV light from the sun. Fungi are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213178/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D2&lt;/a&gt; (animal sources contain vitamin D3), and one cup of wild mushrooms can equal about 136 IU of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:01:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNYVFza2tmdlAyV0ptWGVtLVc0cm5SQlZTVXFqZmVrcWdCNEpvcC1MSnA4XzZFYzR6NWVCUnJFTFBqVmp4Z2tzemtfd01kYnNKMWgwaG9SbTlLU3h1VEUzY3kwY2FmMjBnMlZ6VXNuQTJqR0dWUmE1b2N1aWpuQkZOd3NxTl9Nd0tuemVGRTBtcnpDSzY2SFE</guid></item><item><title>未接种疫苗的儿童长期感染COVID的风险高达20倍，分析发现- Medical Xpress | Unvaccinated kids face up to 20 times higher risk of long COVID, analysis finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPYXFWVFI5WklnUE0tZFVIRjR5bXk4Tlg1eWFRWHFxODBwU3hVeUdqamVWYm1pVTVlZkRrblpiRjNBb0RZbUtLajBSSGdPbWNJNXNfSGRRVXV6RXo1RTV3cUU0RzZkc3BYTzhNZXItVkgwXzl0Y2RDVDd3ZF83Q215QUlsRHZuVk4xS1pn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated children and adolescents were up to 20 times more likely to develop long COVID than their vaccinated peers, according to new research led by a team from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the analysis they performed also indicated that protection afforded by the vaccine primarily comes from preventing infection in the first place, rather than offering special protection against long COVID itself.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In other words, vaccination has been key to preventing COVID-19 infection, which is important to reducing the risk of long COVID as well," said Yong Chen, Ph.D., a professor of Biostatistics and senior author of the study &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537024005418" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID's impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the enduring mysteries of the COVID-19 pandemic is the cause of "long COVID," a collection of symptoms that can appear or persist weeks and months after a person's initial infection has subsided. While the underlying mechanisms of this syndrome remain unclear, scientists know that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; often give rise to post-viral syndromes featuring fatigue, "brain fog," and other non-specific symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections, caused by the emergent coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are no exception: Long COVID, known more formally as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), became remarkably common during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in June 2022, after the worst phases of the pandemic had passed, a survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) suggested that about 7.5% of Americans, including more than 9% of American women, were still suffering from long COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the causes of long COVID remain unclear and no common treatments are currently available, some prior studies have examined whether vaccination prior to infection offers any protection against developing long COVID. However, their findings have been inconsistent. New research now suggests that vaccines may offer greater protection against long COVID than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior studies that simply compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may not fully capture the true impact of vaccination on long COVID, as they often overlook the fact that vaccination substantially reduces the risk of infection in the first place," said co-author Jeffrey Morris, Ph.D., director of Biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research on vaccine effectiveness against long COVID has primarily focused on adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study targets children and adolescents because their immune responses to vaccines and the development of long COVID symptoms might differ significantly from those seen in adults," Morris explained.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Protection against long COVID or infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a research initiative known as RECOVER—which gathers and analyzes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health systems&lt;/a&gt; nationwide to better understand long COVID—the research team conducted an observational study with de-identified electronic health records from nearly 400,000 children and adolescents across the United States. The study pulled data from the major COVID-19 waves of 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these records, the researchers constructed three separate groups or "cohorts" of vaccinated and unvaccinated young people: 112,590 adolescents (12-to-20-year-olds) whose records from July through Nov 2021—when delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 dominated—were analyzed, and 188,894 children (5-to-11-year-olds) and 84,735 adolescents from records dating to January through November 2022—when omicron was dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that the vaccine was about 95% effective in preventing long COVID in adolescents during the delta wave of 2021—meaning vaccinated adolescents were only about 5% as likely to get long COVID compared to their unvaccinated peers. In this cohort, the researchers found 0.11 cases of long COVID in the vaccinated group per 10,000 person-weeks (a statistical measure that accounts for the number of participants and how long they participated), compared to 3.54 cases in the unvaccinated group—a 32-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In 2022, against omicron variants, vaccination was about 60% effective in preventing long COVID in the 5-to-11-year-old group and 75% effective in the 12-to-20-year-old group. In the children's group, the long COVID incidence rates were 0.33 in vaccinated children and 1.07 among the unvaccinated (the rate tripled in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/unvaccinated+children/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt;). Among adolescents in omicron, the incidence rates were 0.24 in the vaccinated and 1.43 among the unvaccinated (almost a six-fold difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using mediation analysis, we were able to disentangle how much of the vaccine's protection was due to preventing initial infection versus a direct benefit on long COVID after infection," said first author Qiong Wu, Ph.D., who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn Medicine and is now an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mediation analysis suggested that, once infected, vaccinated children and adolescents were just as likely to develop long COVID as their unvaccinated peers. This seemed to indicate no additional, special protective effect once infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preventing COVID-19 infections in the first place, including through vaccination, appears to be the best way to avoid long COVID," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Forrest, MD, Ph.D., a professor of Pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was a co-senior author on this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer's disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer's disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S. The findings are published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25000973" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet-Regional Health Americas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previously, research on Alzheimer's disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older," said Allison Aiello, Ph.D., James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School. "The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer's disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+biomarkers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations provide a baseline for predicting long-term trajectories of cognitive decline. "Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer's risk factors—such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, body mass index, cholesterol, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+factor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994–1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70% (71.4–72.5%) were white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11,449 individuals aged 24–34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34–44.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+testing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt;. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50," Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically—genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk. The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer's disease risk in older populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife. However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course," Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer's disease in the coming decades."&lt;/p&gt;

Worldwide, the incidence of early-onset cancers (those 18-49) has surged  almost 80 percent between 1990 and 2019; deaths from these cancers increased  almost 30 percent over that same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AARAPM73DVFY7OTWIVG7PCNTRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am now a 40-year survivor, something I didn’t think I’d live to see.

I shed 15 percent of my body weight and experienced mouth sores, neuropathy, nausea, constipation and hearing loss. I was left with two scars, a three-incher in my pubic area and the other, a 12-incher that runs from below my belly button up to my breastbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LLBIIAUWFG5XIDWP3DKCUYJLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My cancer — which I named “Max” so that I could curse him out by name — affected every aspect of my life, from career and money to sex and intimacy, upending my mental health and my relationships. In the vernacular of young people today, it was “a lot.” I would have called it “too much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJGQDFTLCNHXJGGJZI2KQHTNYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I know all too well the fear and isolation many young people with cancer experience. Cancer is always a lonely proposition, but it’s especially so for young adults. The loneliness I experienced was pervasive. Older people, mostly my parents’ friends, didn’t understand, and my contemporaries often struggled because I had the dubious distinction to be their first friend facing a life-threatening illness. One grad school colleague told me years later, “I just didn’t know how to be your friend once you were diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S3DGBBQACFCODMWT3KH6MJ2GDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Back then, I joined a support group, where almost all my “peers” were married, had kids (even grandkids) or were retired. “Issues for someone age 25 may be very different from someone 35 or 45,” as well as those who are even older, Nancy Borstelmann, the co-director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://www.yalecancercenter.org/patient/specialty/early-onset-cancer-program/#:~:text=The%20Early%20Onset%20Cancer%20Program,onset%20cancer%20and%20their%20families." target="_blank"&gt;Early-Onset Cancer Program&lt;/a&gt;, told me recently. But if there’s one thing we all have in common, she said, it’s the “fear about dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJO4IXO4YJGFZPUVOASDNGFKYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To be fair, I didn’t always know what to say or do, either. I snapped at those who mindlessly asked how I was doing or even in some cases if I was going to die. My peer group just didn’t know better or have much experience with really sick people. One afternoon I got into a heated argument with a nurse who was suggesting a men’s “Small” for the prosthesis I needed. Like any other dude in his twenties, I insisted I was a “Large.” (There were no “Mediums” available.) I responded as though this was a life and death decision. Obviously not, but I did feel as though my “manhood” was on the line. This was new territory, and we all had lessons to learn, including me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMS5XJOX6NADRP4NKZZL7AYABM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I tried hard to wait to worry (or at least not to freak out) while awaiting pathology reports, X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scans. So much uncertainty. A nurse suggested &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664#:~:text=Biofeedback%20is%20a%20type%20of,get%20information%20about%20your%20body." target="_blank"&gt;biofeedback&lt;/a&gt; to me, which she explained could lessen my dependence on antianxiety drugs. I tried it and it helped. She also explained that the worst possible outcome is not the most common one. I struggled with that suggestion when she said it but time has proved her right; I remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCLT7ZRXGNCA3MPVPIPNDEWUGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were other challenges. Postsurgery I could no longer do everything for myself as I once had. That included bending over to tie my shoes or going food shopping. I needed help for the first time in my life; it took me a while to learn how to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYDHMWDSRRGYBKGSGR7BCWWDSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I didn’t know how to talk about my fears. While hospitalized for two weeks I relied on a well-honed sarcasm, which pushed people away, or my ever-growing list of grievances, like the poly/cotton sheets on my bed, the robes that never cover your butt, and the size of that silicone prosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XYKE2ULHIJEALBA6LEH7LM34JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I railed at the loss of control as I tried — in vain — to reassert it. When my hair began to fall out, I cut it off preemptively. Fearing that my boyfriend would leave me, I broke up with him first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PHU23XSNNBHJATKLK3WXPJALI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And I blamed myself. “What did I do to deserve this?” I asked repeatedly. I had yet to learn the lesson that bad things happen to good people, or really, that any illusion of control is just that. Cancer pierced any notion that life is fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VA6CGIVOYVCOFKCBFCHSCOOVL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I also discovered that the psychological side effects of my disease could rival the physical ones. My second, more complicated surgery had a frequent side effect of affecting fertility. At 26, I’d hardly given any thought to raising a family, when a hospital social worker asked me, “Would you like a referral to a sperm bank?” (Yes, I would.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHCGF3YR6RDFFIGQOQFAQYY4SA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few years after my diagnosis, and when all my treatments were done, I left grad school in a fog of uncertainty. I wrote in my journal back then: “If I have a shorter life, I don’t want to spend the next five years in this program.” I didn’t think about saving for retirement, buying a house, or doing any of the “adult” things my friends were now doing. Instead I bought a lot of nice sweaters, putting them on multiple credit cards. Why pay today, when tomorrow might not come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJQ7UOC5JNBLJNSZIM46HKRYJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’d be misleading you if I left the impression that all was dark. I found a new career as a writer. I met a new boyfriend. My hair grew back! I also chose to face some weighty questions: How do I live a life that matters? How do I want to spend my time? What gives me joy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HSHU4XJUGZHONC2FNVRTTFE7JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s the ironic thing about having cancer as a young adult: You confront the idea of death too soon, but if all goes well you have a lot of years afterward. You struggle to believe it’s behind you, while still dreading its return. But time does heal some wounds. It also gave me much-needed perspective, even a sense of humor. When I lost a job, separated from my husband and even when a huge branch of a pecan tree almost  crushed my house, I was able to say to myself, “At least, it’s not cancer!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPSFB5QWNNUHB5djZIQkR2cUpQbzRENUJBS2FPaWUxeXhSYWxIWElYRTJIY3h3M0pRbDhyb2FwaEQyTXk5SW9rU0pUc2E1RXlCQnFBNWtSVFJjeks0UTN6OTA4bTVzam1VQkxKM1pZM3pySkZGZXZQcExNQTZuaS05UlJOYmk3ajJvRFhTUQ</guid></item><item><title>如何快速安全地减掉多达5磅的水分- womansworld.com | How To Lose up to 5 Lbs of Water Weight Quickly + Safely - womansworld.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE13YXdTbHN2RVJwMFgyVTFfUmlNZVp0MllrVk1xVWRma1EzbjFWbVBvcHFsaF81d2xsb2NKOTdGY01VeEFzS2tTaTVIaTZpNnU3MWRTbkoySUlDRUlZQjhXZFVaUGliREJOLWtWUTFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-221442 single-format-standard post-lose-the-water-weight theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Last week, he promised to find some of the causes of rising U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-autism-cases-health-secretary-ca210c5c37e12d6377a1af16ae4f4fbc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism rates&lt;/a&gt; in under six months’ time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's followers — a contingent of health-conscious moms, Republicans loyal to President Donald Trump and others — have celebrated his “Make America Healthy Again” initiatives. But scientists and public health experts have expressed dismay over some of Kennedy's statements about Americans' diets, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a look at some of those claims Kennedy has made, with additional context and facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at a news conference Wednesday: Studies show that autism rates in the U.S. were “1 in 10,000 when I was a kid” compared to a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that found it to be 1 in 31. He says that is evidence of an autism epidemic in the U.S. and that, “we know it's an environmental exposure. It has to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: It’s true that in the 20th century, only 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism —- the diagnosis was rare and given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders,” and the number of kids labeled as having some form of autism began to balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The term “epidemic” is widely used to describe surges in different health problems — like autism, obesity and gun violence, to name a few. But strictly speaking, “epidemic” is defined as a fast-spreading outbreak of disease, and there's not good evidence that autism meets that definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials have largely attributed growing autism numbers to better recognition of cases, through wide screening and better diagnosis. Last week, the CDC said &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are no blood or biologic tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to his rise to health secretary, Kennedy joined anti-vaccine advocates in claiming childhood vaccines are responsible for autism, but studies by the CDC and others have ruled that out. A fraudulent single study that claimed a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy recently announced a major study into the cause of autism and told an April 10 Cabinet meeting: “By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” But last week, he softened that to having ”some of the answers by September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Mike Stobbe and Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in interview with Sean Hannity that aired on Fox News on March 11: “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is safe and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. There have been no documented deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/#:~:text=Fact%3A%20Getting%20the%20vaccine%20is,don't%20get%20the%20vaccine." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Infectious Diseases Society of America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people who get the MMR vaccine have no serious problems from it, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The most common side effects are mild: a sore arm, fever, mild rash and temporary joint pain or stiffness in teenage or adult women who don’t already have rubella immunity. There is a very small risk of febrile seizures that increases as infants get older, which is why the shot is recommended as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people can have allergic reactions; people allergic to the antibiotic neomycin should not get the shot, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in an April interview with CBS: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the (MMR) vaccine wanes very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.&lt;/a&gt; Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 million to 4 million cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;3 million to 4 million cases&lt;/a&gt; per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Usually, most measles cases come to the U.S. from abroad. This is why high vaccination rates are important. When 95% or more people are vaccinated, entire communities are considered protected from the virus, which is important for people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in a CBS interview posted April 9, discussing death of 8-year-old child in Texas who had measles: “The thing that killed (her) was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Two children in Texas have died — both from measles complications, according to the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services. The state health department has made clear that the children were not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Doctors at University Medical Center in Lubbock who treated the 8-year-old said she died of “measles pulmonary failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Claiming that patients die of complications and not the actual disease that led to them is a tactic that anti-vaccine advocates have used to undermine Texas health experts since the first child died of measles in March — and in other outbreaks before that. It's also a talking point that Kennedy, who spent &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-vaccines-trump-rfkjr-7f8dcb25de76a5a70710d22bbc63f6fa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;20 years&lt;/a&gt; as one of the world's leading anti-vaccine activists, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:continues to amplify;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;continues to amplify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles complications can include pneumonia, brain swelling and other respiratory or neurological complications, which can lead to death in 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,&lt;/a&gt; said two &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas doctors&lt;/a&gt; "have treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Pediatricians note there is no cure for measles: It is a virus that the body has to fight off on its own. The best way to protect against the risks of measles is to get vaccinated to lower the chance of contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Budesonide is a steroid used in different forms to treat asthma, ulcerative colitis and other conditions. Clarithromycin is an antibiotic; it fights bacteria, not viruses. Neither drug is recommended for treating measles — the use is “risky and unproven” — &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOopVJ39D8WDjcJEmWlUZYL1J9rLVJURjgaldZptndNq-UQVOGGZ2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the American Academy of Pediatrics says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are no miracle cures for measles,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, who chairs the academy's Committee on Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOorT8Sr9yjNVQdr2q9VZwpm0YYljuJGUDnKV-BWaft656gAsiHDC" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently said in a fact check on the organization's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recently said in a fact check on the organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. "If your child becomes sick with measles, doctors will do everything we can to care for them, but the truth is we do not have effective treatments against this viral infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nutrition and obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at an April 15 event in Indianapolis, said 70% of Americans are obese or overweight, compared to 3% of Americans during President John F. Kennedy's tenure in the early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Nearly three-quarters of Americans are overweight, including about 40% with obesity, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent figures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent figures&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. Between 1960 and 1962, about 13% of people in the U.S. had obesity, according to historic CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rise in obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries in recent decades has been well-documented and studied. Experts say there is no single explanation for the increase, but that it stems from a combination of factors, including biological and environmental contributors, an increase in available calories and a decline in physical activity. Changes in the food supply, including the development of high-calorie, cheap ultraprocessed foods have been linked to obesity, but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-nih-kevin-hall-kennedy-b40b626771519f3f9a6546699491fc3b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exactly how these foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exactly how these foods&lt;/a&gt; affect weight gain remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY at April 10 cabinet meeting regarding food dyes: “We’ve shown now that this directly affects academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: &lt;a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/report/health-effects-assessment-potential-neurobehavioral-effects-synthetic-food-dyes-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recent research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows synthetic food colors common in U.S. foods are linked to neurobehavioral problems in children and that the dyes may cause or exacerbate symptoms, particularly hyperactivity. In addition, children may vary widely in their sensitivity to the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is clear that some children are likely to be more adversely affected by food dyes than others," researchers in California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment reported in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those responses have the potential to affect school work and behaviors such as aggression, but to date there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between food dyes and academic performance, violence or other mental and physical conditions, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To date, scientific evidence shows that “most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY on March 28 during a speech in West Virginia to encourage restrictions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: “Twenty years ago, there was no diabetes in China. Today 50% of the population is diabetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Diabetes prevalence has gone up in China over the past two decades, driven by rising living standards, urbanization and an aging population. About 6.1% of the population had diabetes in 2001-2002, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16176207/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2005 analysis.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2005 analysis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But that has only grown to to 12.4%, according to latest data included in a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00250-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lancet report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lancet report&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— JoNel Aleccia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;AP reporter Amanda Seitz in Washington contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
