During the two-month study, participants gained significant &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/without_fail__muscular_adaptations_in_single_set.782.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;muscle mass and strength&lt;/a&gt; from just two 30-minute sessions of uncomplicated resistance exercises each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DOFNRR7AOBAQLCD347LXH6QEJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings “highlight how powerful even a small amount of loading can be,” said Stuart Phillips, an exercise scientist at McMaster University in Canada who studies resistance training but was not involved in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R7ONNOMSFRF6ZMFXZHM2TWAW4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In each session, the volunteers completed nine common upper- and lower-body &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;gym exercises&lt;/a&gt;, repeating each move eight to 10 times, until their muscles felt fatigued but not necessarily exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDGQWS7Q4RDWPOU67XTJUMPMUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The routine was meant to be quick because so many people blame tight schedules for not lifting, said Brad Schoenfeld, a professor of exercise science at Lehman College in the Bronx and the study’s senior author. “We were interested in finding the minimum effective dose” of resistance training for most people, he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V6R664IN5NDVVLWYZXJI3OTGMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In other words, they wanted to see, “how low can you go?” with lifting workouts, Phillips said. The results show “just how small of an investment we need to make to reap some, in my estimation, substantial rewards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="22KL5K7JSRAGNJ3KNI6JW5YZYA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="22KL5K7JSRAGNJ3KNI6JW5YZYA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why most people don’t weight train&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZOXINXBKJB2XKJ4V3LH4DPOFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Almost all of us, if we’re capable of exercising, should be doing some type of regular “muscle-strengthening activities” for our health and longevity, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Strong, healthy muscles &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;help protect us&lt;/a&gt; against diabetes, arthritis and a range of other diseases, as well as frailty and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7G6IW5I75DGNMW3SSXQWNRLEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But few of us lift. The CDC estimates, in fact, that barely 20 percent of American adults strength train even a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OIOOD3X625FUHBYOCUTLNGGE7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The main reason people give is time,” Schoenfeld said. Many worry, too, that weight training requires complex equipment and arcane expertise about loads, reps and other lifting matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GQ2QZ4CVL5GV5O6MNXAU6JL3HU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the study, published in April in Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise, Schoenfeld and his collaborators put together a speedy, simple, full-body, gym-based workout, with exercises focused on the shoulders, arms, legs, back and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4UPUQNTPAZEKBHE4ZXOTPEIRXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then they rounded up a group of healthy men and women, ages 18 to 40, who already did some resistance training. This lifting experience was important because an effective minimalist approach should be able to continue building muscle mass and strength, even in muscles that already are somewhat strong and buff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="C777KA4AVRGHJAHMFEOGFMV7FQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="C777KA4AVRGHJAHMFEOGFMV7FQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Is a half-hour workout enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XOPMOXFKB5BM5HEUGCNVWTYZWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The scientists invited their volunteers to the gym twice a week, for supervised sessions, where everyone did the same nine exercises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="BFNSVMQV2ZFP3OFFFLFSXE2MYA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Front lat pull-down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seated cable row.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shoulder press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chest press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cable triceps pushdown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supinated dumbbell biceps curl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smith machine squats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leg press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leg extension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VKLPUNXVSVGF3DNFGJPSWCM77I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At first, the researchers set people’s weights so they could complete, at most, 10 repetitions of each move before they simply couldn’t manage another, a condition known as reaching failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZB5IQQJPNCAZHZLIJM6QFJR4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Half of the volunteers continued to lift to failure every time. The other half backed off, lifting until their muscles felt challenged and tired but hadn’t reached failure; they could’ve eked out a few more repetitions, if they’d had to. Among lifters, this is known as leaving reps in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DBZJJMFOLJGTDGBQXQRHY4MGLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important for time efficiency, the volunteers completed only one set of each exercise, which, for many, represented a substantial reduction in volume. Most had been doing at least two or three sets of every exercise during their workouts, spending hours in the gym every week.

After two months, almost everyone’s muscles were larger, stronger and more powerful than at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIP72HT3LFDKBPVF2BFPRRNRHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The magnitude of the changes proved to be similar among men and women and those who’d lifted to failure and those who’d left a few reps in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XN2OIOM2WBFUXLPJTROQVXQZQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You need to put in some effort,” Schoenfeld said. But you don’t need to lift until your muscles are completely exhausted to show significant gains in strength and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WAGYVORZMNHVDAA6WOFMSF2ZSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You also don’t need to follow this study’s regimen precisely, he said. “There’s nothing special” about these particular exercises, in this order. Substitute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;body weight exercises&lt;/a&gt; like pull-ups or push-ups for some of the exercises, he said, or ask a trainer at your gym to show you the machines there that work the shoulders, biceps, back, core and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGCAFJTY4JHIXG46ZPSOITET2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re new to lifting, the trainer could be especially useful, Schoenfeld added, to teach you proper form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TAB4RKC6JGQ3KR6LXADGJGUDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the key to lifting for muscle health will always be simple consistency, he said. Show up twice a week and challenge your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2J4I3RS65HDXI7IRQSI3JGRHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unlikely, based on this study, that most of us need more than two, short weight workouts a week, he continued, unless our goal is to become swole. (Mine isn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U3MB3PLVYRAK7ERG7VSKIPK6DQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the other hand, we probably can’t get away with fewer than two sessions most weeks, he said, if we wish to keep growing stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DN5FZ4H6CVAIHLCAEFGHS6SN5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for scheduling those workouts, “don’t do them back-to-back,” Schoenfeld advised. Leave at least one day between each session, but otherwise Tuesdays and Thursdays, or Fridays and Mondays, or Sundays and Wednesdays, or whatever works for you should be fine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PZAGHS5YSVFEVP3GMSGLBEYB74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This study was relatively short-term, lasting only eight weeks, and involved mostly healthy adults. It’s “quite likely” but not certain that the results apply equally to older people and other groups, Schoenfeld said, and that the benefits continue past two months. He plans future studies of those issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZVJ54NQD3VCSTF6CBEQL5DETJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But for now, “the message, I think, is to find one hour somewhere in your week” to lift, he said, which can be as much — and as little — as most of us need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:58:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPcWJ6N2o0a3pYV0ZpM0VlTWJEb3ZEa0R1WTl0NDZtdC1XM0FDc0xqMDZDQ1lKdTlrazBqR1lwMEVmYWlzeEYzbnUxazJWWGx2WEFNdi1VM282WGxQVko2bjhxY3NuaWIxREMwNFR6Tm1saDNkOFNlR25zbHdwa2RSQkVtY3VOUDBFLTJHcw</guid></item><item><title>新的减肥药物正在将惊人数量的美国人送往急诊室- Gizmodo | New Weight-Loss Drugs Are Sending a Surprising Number of Americans to the Emergency Room - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOdnFDTVZtRUFvS0FqNE5maFNxN0s0dXFHbngtaklmelIxYkswV1lxclpOZFppVFpfWmpodDdzTEVubG9UWmdGYnYzbUFRMTRMeENydXdMNHNZY1hOWVBvX2RLUXBTMkN1bmVLMzMzQ1BsNnJ6WTlpd24xd1E1SnVXMkhEVk9oNFJ5QU5rbzU1Zm1SblBJeVN3N1NDc052d2RybkVXX01HM1hKeGI3aWZKLTIwcGp5U2UyYm5v?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, isn’t without its risks. A recent study has found that tens of thousands of Americans have ended up in the emergency room from taking semaglutide over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in Annals of Internal Medicine. Based on national surveillance data, the researchers estimate that semaglutide contributed to nearly 25,000 ER visits between 2022 and 2023, usually from gastrointestinal complications. The findings suggest that doctors can do more to mitigate the potentially severe side effects of these drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs mimic GLP-1, one of several hormones that play a key role in regulating our metabolism and hunger. GLP-1 drugs have existed for over two decades, but semaglutide is part of a newer and more effective generation. It was first approved in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic. In 2021, it was approved to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, doctors have also commonly prescribed Ozempic off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every drug comes with its side effects, however. People taking GLP-1s commonly experience nausea, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. Usually, these side effects are mild and/or tend to decline over time. But in some cases, they can become serious enough to warrant emergency medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/data-sources-and-methods/data-sources/national-electronic-injury-surveillance-system-cooperative-adverse-drug-event-surveillance-project-neiss-cades"&gt;NEISS-CADES&lt;/a&gt;), which keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the researchers estimated that 24,499 ER visits were attributable to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023. Nearly 70% of these visits involved GI symptoms, while roughly 17% involved hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and about 6% represented allergic reactions. About a third of hypoglycemia-related visits led to hospitalization, as did 15% of GI-related visits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should be taken in some context. Many drugs can cause side effects that could result in an ER visit, including common over-the-counter medications. In a 2021 study from many of the same authors, they found that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;roughly 1 in 200 Americans&lt;/a&gt; visit the ER each year due to medication-related harms, for instance, with two-thirds caused by therapeutic use (meaning that the drugs were taken to treat a medical problem, not recreationally). A 2022 study by the same team &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that OTC cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ER visits in the U.S. annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the results of this latest study shouldn’t be minimized either. More than 82% of the ER visits happened in 2023, suggesting that as semaglutide use has surged, so have its potential harms. About 9% of the visits involved medication errors, such as people taking more than instructed. So we might be able to prevent some ER visits with better patient education. In other cases, doctors could lower their patients’ risk of serious complications by better managing their use of other medications, and at the very least, they can probably do more to prepare their patients in advance before starting GLP-1 therapy, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians could counsel patients when initiating semaglutide about the potential for severe gastrointestinal adverse effects and adjust co-prescribed antidiabetic medications to decrease hypoglycemia risk,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cacio e pepe is made by cooking pasta and using the resulting starchy water to create a sauce with grated cheese and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers recommend that the perfect recipe for two involves dissolving 5g of powdered starch in 50g of water rather than using the reserved pasta water&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– as traditional recipes do. Then, heat the mixture gently until it thickens and turns clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next, add 100g of water to cool the mixture, before blending it with 200g of cheese and adding toasted black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The resulting sauce should then be mixed with 300g of pasta that has been cooked in slightly salted water until it is al dente, drained and allowed to cool slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This step helps prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce. Finally, they say a little reserved starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,” the researchers write. “For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the co-authors of the research, said the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study, with “most of it eaten with bread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels,” he added. “It’s the price of science!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When heated, cheese proteins change their configuration and, therefore, aggregate,” said Dr Daniel Busiello, another co-author of the study from Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Starch, he said, mitigates this effect by binding to the cheese proteins, reducing their direct interactions and hence their formation of clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To explore the secret to a smooth and creamy sauce, researchers carried out a number of experiments using a fixed cheese-to-water ratio, but with varying concentrations of starch. The latter was controlled by dissolving known quantities of dry corn starch in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results revealed fewer clumps occurred at lower temperatures, regardless of starch concentration, with the team adding that the proteins did not start to clump below 65C. As temperatures increased, higher concentrations of starch were needed to avoid clumps forming and prevent the “mozzarella phase” – where huge wads of cheese appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At higher starch concentrations, temperature becomes less of a concern, as the sauce remains smooth even with less precise heat control,” said Busiello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Busiello added pasta water alone contains too little starch to reliably prevent clumping, only producing a smooth sauce with careful temperature control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our recommended scientific approach uses a starch to cheese ratio between 2% and 3% by weight, allowing home cooks to reliably create a smooth sauce without worrying too much about temperature,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNMTFOQWl6Q2x0TzE2cUkzejJaM2NKZ19JejZvMmFOWWpScG5haXRrc1JXUHJRSW45cmVXTWNvUkxneW4waFpLUkpkeGNLWG0zQ1J2MHJQZW1yVFh0dGtBUjF6Rk04VVhXUFJ6WVc2ZEJSZVJjTm1KYVhVUUhWVVlSY2hNWXZCeFJMNDZEZVliN0VWX3gtV3J4dGdLVjhFbk5XZEZsdnJDNVhzd1BMQTFkQWpGNmlrN2UzeXc</guid></item><item><title>氯胺酮隐藏的身心伤害-神经科学新闻 | Ketamine's Hidden Physical and Psychological Damage - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1NTWhFMG5ZcUlOeDV5X18wbGlPZFk4ZGsyQy1TQ3QtTzZjZXEzN3FzYVNyMUpnQmUwLTFzbFNBUDhJb2VQSFRGY3p4SUpOMEotc0dvbHR3LW5CQnJIam5uTUZhX3lXcF9vT1NWc0dpZmhzeDdvSUJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study highlights the severe physical and psychological consequences linked to ketamine addiction, with many users unaware of the risks until dependent. Researchers found high rates of bladder damage, painful organ cramps, low mood, and anxiety among those with ketamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the serious health impacts, nearly half of affected individuals had not sought treatment, and many reported poor experiences with healthcare providers. The findings call for better public awareness, improved clinical recognition, and more effective treatment programs for ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe Health Impacts:&lt;/strong&gt; 60% of ketamine users reported bladder or nasal problems, and over half experienced painful organ cramps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Treatment Access:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 56% sought help, and only 36% of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Many users were unaware ketamine could cause addiction until it was too late, highlighting urgent public education needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ketamine addiction is linked to high levels of physical health problems and psychological consequences, with nearly half of those affected not seeking support or treatment, new research has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by the University of Exeter and University College London (UCL), is the largest to date to explore the experience of people currently living with ketamine addiction in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by NIHR, the research included interviews with users, in which many said they were not aware of the risks of addiction until their ketamine use was already out of control, with one calling ketamine “the heroin of a generation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied 274 people who identified as having ketamine use disorder, and found previously under-reported symptoms. Of those, 60 per cent had experienced bladder or nasal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that 56 per cent reported K-cramps – a painful organ cramping linked to excessive ketamine use, with which can often drive people back to the drug to seek relief from the pain of this symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bladder problems can involve needing a full bladder removal, and the need for a urostomy bag to collect urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological symptoms included cravings, low mood, anxiety and irritability.  The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;, found that only 56 per cent of participants sought treatment, and only 36 per cent of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Professor Celia Morgan, of University of Exeter, said: “We know that ketamine use is on the rise, with a number of high-profile tragedies linked to ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, a growing number of clinical trials are finding therapeutic benefits involving ketamine in carefully-controlled environments, combined with therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is the first to analyse in-depth the experience of people using very large amounts of ketamine, and shows the devastating physical health problems people can face with dependent ketamine use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study also highlights the barriers that people with ketamine addiction face when they try to seek treatment, often being sent away from treatment services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uk government data indicates that ketamine use has more than doubled since 2016, with a threefold increase among 25-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the impact on those who develop an addition to ketamine, the study involved both questionnaires and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, 59 per cent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” enough awareness in education and among peer groups around the risks associated with ketamine, with many reporting that they did not know the drug could be addictive. Many reported feeling too embarrassed to seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews, one participant said: “People know the risks about Heroin and Cocaine, but not how the addiction to Ketamine can become even stronger than being addicted to heroin or cocaine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While another told researchers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel it is the heroin of a generation, and more information will become available once more time passes and more people my age begin to suffer so greatly from misuse that it can’t be hidden anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also painted a picture of a lack of understanding among health professionals. One said: All they did was give me painkillers and send me on my way”, while another reported “GP doesn’t think ketamine is addictive, just told me to stop, doesn’t have a clue”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Rebecca Harding, a PhD candidate at University College London, said: “Our study highlights the need for greater recognition of the significant physical and psychological risks associated with ketamine, both among healthcare professionals and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need improved treatment programs, while raising awareness of ketamine use, to better support those seeking care. By focusing on evidence-based treatments, such as specialised group therapy and pharmacological interventions, we can improve access to effective treatment and address the growing challenge of ketamine use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this addiction and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7a7a5b2a4a4b8b1b1beb4b297b2afb2a3b2a5f9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/add.70073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/a&gt;” by Celia Morgan et al. &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0001-title"&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report the symptoms and aetiology of ketamine use disorder (KUD), gauge the effectiveness of current treatment services and identify strategies to enhance patient access and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0002-title"&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed-methods, cross-sectional questionnaire. Electronic survey from November 2023 to April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0003-title"&gt;Setting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, social media and referrals from UK addiction treatment services. The survey was open to international participants, with responses collected from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0004-title"&gt;Participants/Cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 274 individuals with self-identified KUD, including both treatment-seeking (40%) and non-treatment-seeking (60%) current or former ketamine users. Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 67 years old, with 47.7% identifying as male. Additionally, 58.8% reported a diagnosed mental health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants consumed 2.0 g of ketamine per day, with treatment-seeking individuals reporting higher average use (M = 2.67 g) than non-treatment-seeking users (M = 1.68 g) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0005-title"&gt;Measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing their attitudes toward ketamine and treatment services, including questions pertaining to their symptoms of problematic ketamine use, perceptions of education and awareness about KUD, opinions of existing treatment options, and facilitators for seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0006-title"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified various physical symptoms associated with KUD, with bladder problems (60%), nasal problems (60%) and ‘K-cramps’ (56%) being commonly reported among all users. In response to these symptoms, the majority (56%) did not seek treatment; among treatment-seeking users only 36% reported feeling satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of abstinence syndrome were also identified, including cravings (71%), low mood (62%), anxiety (59%) and irritability (45%). Treatment-seeking participants reported that the services they used had little (31%) or some (31%) awareness of ketamine, were not tailored to ketamine use (43%) and were generally only somewhat effective (43%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine percent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” sufficient awareness in education and peer groups about the risks associated with ketamine use. When asked about the most important factors when choosing a treatment program, cost/affordability was the most cited for all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0007-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine use disorder (KUD) appears to be associated with a high prevalence of physical and psychological symptoms, including some specifically linked to abstinence. Despite this, most individuals with KUD do not seek treatment, and existing services are often perceived as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:56:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1NTWhFMG5ZcUlOeDV5X18wbGlPZFk4ZGsyQy1TQ3QtTzZjZXEzN3FzYVNyMUpnQmUwLTFzbFNBUDhJb2VQSFRGY3p4SUpOMEotc0dvbHR3LW5CQnJIam5uTUZhX3lXcF9vT1NWc0dpZmhzeDdvSUJN</guid></item><item><title>呃，在选择退出CT扫描之前，你应该三思而后行，因为你担心癌症。-石板 | Uh, You Should Think Twice Before Opting Out of a CT Scan Because You’re Worried About Cancer. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPN3lFRmZ0YWlrR25YazFtWFdMbW9lbWFoYnlIdVUydkJJWWx5d19PekllMldfRWstNm9yOGNiRzFLdG0xb1hoVUpuMEswNDVscmpTUjNGYU9Qbi0xbnR4NWhHNUgtY2tLWnlwS2JrMVR0WGdqeU5TWVlKNVNhZHRnelFWVEphUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrave0083cwm4bsu4i0ln@published"&gt;When you get an X-ray, it can be a bit unnerving: The radiology technician puts on a lead gown or ducks behind a barrier before running the scan. Which might make you wonder: If the radiation is so bad that they need protective equipment, why are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; getting exposed to it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreow000o3b73eibfswbb@published"&gt;There is a simple answer. You are getting only one dose of radiation from your scan, but the tech might be doing a couple dozen of those same scans a day. Radiation doses add up, so people who regularly work with the machines need protection so that they can lower their risk of getting cancer from their job.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreqk000p3b73fxb5cyhr@published"&gt;But a new study questions whether scans—specifically &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675#:~:text=Your%20healthcare%20professional%20may%20suggest,infection%20or%20blood%20clot%20is."&gt;computed tomography scans&lt;/a&gt;—are causing more cancer than we thought, specifically among the patients who receive them. CTs are given to people in emergency departments who have had &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.carj.2018.10.004?casa_token=fSwu9Jxec7wAAAAA%3ArsB5yV9MVaaoE09squWTsWYH5xJnqeUNgkk8c8UsfYajm9PTCKYdfRsX_Q1vLmlCHucww3bmYhxd7A"&gt;serious trauma or are having a suspected stroke&lt;/a&gt;. Other CTs are used to identify and treat cancer, rule out serious neurological problems, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14610965/cancer-CT-scans-study-children.html"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ct-scans-projected-to-result-in-100000-new-cancers-in-the-us"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ct-scan-cancer-risk-11719982"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/16/g-s1-60488/ct-scan-cancer-risk-ionizing-radiation"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/could-ct-scans-be-fuelling-a-future-rise-in-cancer-cases-as-a-new-study-suggests-254633"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt;, CT scans could be &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; a remarkably high number of cancers each year and could eventually be responsible for 1 in 20 cancers in the United States.

Although CT scans can and sometimes do cause cancer in patients, the reality is that you probably aren’t in much danger when you go in for a recommended scan.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrew1000r3b73riza114s@published"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778"&gt;The study itself&lt;/a&gt; is basically a modeling exercise. The authors took an estimate of the number of CT scans done every year in the U.S., based on research from 2023. Next, they estimated the dose of radiation that each CT would give the patient, based on the body part that was exposed in the scan and evidence from studies of radiation dosage. Finally, they used an online calculator, called RadRAT, to estimate the number of cancers that the estimated radiation dosage would cause over the lifetimes of all the people getting the scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrey1000s3b739qi89lj3@published"&gt;The authors found that in 2023 there were 93 million CTs done on 62 million patients. The total estimated lifetime number of cancers caused by the radiation from these CTs in their model came out to about 100,000. So, for the 62 million people who got CTs over the course of 2023, there would eventually be an additional 100,000 cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrezv000t3b73yrh12cwt@published"&gt;This sounds like a big number, but is it, really, compared with the overall amount of cancer in the population? If you ask the authors, they say that the cancer from CT scans could &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; add up to 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. That seems pretty significant! But this is assuming that the number of yearly cancers stays the same between now and 2075 (about the time the kids included in the study would be developing cancer from the CT scans they received in 2023). That’s very unlikely—the total number of cancers annually will probably &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; by then due to population growth alone. In any case, it’s a figure based on an iffy assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf1f000u3b731cw7jnyb@published"&gt;I think a better way to look at this is by considering that about 40 percent of people will get cancer in their lifetime. If 62 million people are getting CTs, we’d estimate that 25 million of them would get cancer without the additional CT risk. The extra cancers from the CTs therefore account for an additional 0.4 percent, or one extra lifetime cancer per 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf33000v3b733zlg898e@published"&gt;In context, that number is not scary at all. The authors of the study compare CT scans with alcohol consumption, which is another risk factor for cancer. But people rarely get CT scans for the fun of it. One of the most common reasons for having a CT in the first place is because you either probably or definitely have cancer already, and the imaging can help doctors know exactly what they’re dealing with so they can do their best to get rid of it. Most people are likely fine with accepting a 1-in-250 risk of getting an additional cancer if it means that their current cancer can be treated appropriately rather than having a surgeon simply guess where the tumor is located. No serious medical treatment is risk-free; we get treatment anyway because the downsides of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing anything are worse. In this case, they can be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf4q000w3b733essq6i1@published"&gt;The other issue with the estimate of 100,000 cancers is that it’s almost certainly too high. RadRAT, the calculator that the researchers used, is designed to estimate the lifetime risk of cancer for people who &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/22810503"&gt;are generally healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, when calculating lifetime risk, the tool assumes that people who are exposed to radiation are going to live as long as the average person of that age and sex who was alive in the U.S. in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf6f000x3b735ojrikzw@published"&gt;But we know that CTs are not generally given to otherwise healthy people. If you’re not in great shape to start, you’re less likely to live as long as the average person, and you have less time to develop cancer in the first place. It’s quite likely that the lifetime number of cancers is dramatically overestimated by the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf82000y3b73d1dcufzp@published"&gt;There is a useful bit of truth in the lesson news stories are taking from the paper: You shouldn’t get a CT scan unless you actually need one. We do have a problem with doing too many CT scans. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363018820302048?casa_token=AfuUGbksmKsAAAAA:qZp3p8PkAo5Rz85VSYJvNHIh-8kdiNKfvHcgGoc_o2Bchl_6rqGYterhy72ahf8_4auWs82bNg"&gt;Studies looking at&lt;/a&gt; whether CT scans were appropriately ordered suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009926019305483?casa_token=jxHFl11ruDYAAAAA:2uPHWrYbFRKabpaT8M5gveiQunC62Oye7WbS0aR-l6qUvWfc-6F-LxbvG8-dC8PiSAg_5lPGkQ"&gt;somewhere between&lt;/a&gt; 8 and 36 percent of them are not needed. Given that these scans definitely do cause cancer—albeit quite rarely—we should instead be trying to ensure that we perform them only when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrfa1000z3b73gs21j47l@published"&gt;That being said, the idea that 1 in 20 cancers is—or will be—&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJABhXDyX5t/?hl=en"&gt;caused by CTs&lt;/a&gt; is very unlikely to be true. The actual figure is presumably quite a bit lower. And while we should be careful to use those high-radiation scans only when necessary, in most cases if a doctor tells you to get a CT, you should probably do &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terlizzi and his fellow author are all living abroad and frequently meet for dinner. Cacio e pepe is among their favorite traditional dishes to make, and as physicists, they couldn't help but want to learn more about the unique physics of the process, not to mention "the more practical aim to avoid wasting good pecorino," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081682?"&gt;said Terlizzi&lt;/a&gt;. They focused on the separation that often occurs when cheese and water are mixed, building on earlier &lt;a href="https://bressanini-lescienze.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2013/05/13/le-ricette-scientifiche-la-cacio-e-pepe/"&gt;culinary experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pasta cooks in boiling water, the noodles release starch. Traditionally, the chef will extract part of the water and starch solution—which is cooled to a suitable temperature to avoid clumping as the cheese proteins "denaturate"—and mix it with the cheese to make the sauce, adding the pepper last, right before serving. But the authors note that temperature is not the only factor that can lead to this dreaded “mozzarella phase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, if one tries to mix cheese and water without any starch, the clumping is more pronounced. There is less clumping with water containing a little starch, like water in which pasta has been cooked. And when one mixes the cheese with pasta water "risottata"—i.e., collected and heated in a pan so enough water evaporates that there is a higher concentration of starch—there is almost no clumping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starch plays a crucial role in the process of making cacio e pepe. The authors devised a set of experiments to scientifically investigate the phase behavior of water, starch, and cheese mixed together in various concentrations and at different temperatures. They primarily used standard kitchen tools to make sure home cooks could recreate their results (although not every kitchen has a sous vide machine). This enabled them to devise a phase diagram of what happens to the sauce as the conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;

Using computational models, behavioral tasks, and clinical data from Parkinson’s patients, researchers found that stopping and switching are distinct cognitive motor processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight could improve treatments for neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and inspire biologically driven designs for autonomous systems. The findings highlight the complexity and precision of how the human brain adapts rapidly to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching vs. Stopping:&lt;/strong&gt; Switching actions is a separate process from stopping, actively suppressing previous movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Studying Parkinson’s patients during deep brain stimulation reveals key brain activity related to switching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding action regulation could improve therapies and inspire new robotics technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New USC research offers an unseen insight into how the brain shifts gears. The researchers discovered that our innate ability to make quick changes in motor function are the result of a unique brain mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the high-stakes world of the NBA, we watch in awe as our favorite player seamlessly switches moves in the blink of an eye.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a remarkable ability to rapidly switch between different motor actions when life throws us a curveball. You reach to pull open a door but suddenly see you must push to exit. In traffic, you must think fast to change from accelerating to evading or braking to avoid an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain function that helps us switch course has been the subject of extensive scientific debate, with the key question being whether the function the brain uses to help us switch gears is the same one it uses to stop our movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from USC’s Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering has harnessed a complex mathematical model to reveal that this switch is not an extension of stopping but a unique action that actively suppresses the previous one, enabling a seamless transition to the new target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team has also been observing Parkinson’s patients playing simple video gaming tasks in order to study the mechanism in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;, shedding new light on how our brains select, stop, and switch between actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Vasileios Christopoulos, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering, said that while switching course may seem like an innate process for humans, the complexity of how this is triggered in the brain has been a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, psychologists believe that switching is an extension of stopping. It’s what we call ‘go, stop, go.’ You go. You stop and you switch to the new action,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we believe that — especially when you have to perform something really fast — your brain doesn’t do that. Instead, the new action suppresses your current action without using another mechanism to inhibit it. Stopping and switching are two different cognitive motor processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said the function was fundamental to understand from a scientific perspective, given that humans switch and regulate their actions at every moment of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a clinical perspective, if we understand how the brain regulates actions, and if we understand how Parkinson’s affects these mechanisms, we can create better clinical treatments for patients,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also the engineering perspective. If we can create a model of the brain that generates actions, then we can create biologically-inspired robotic systems, like autonomous cars, based on the way that the brain actually regulates these actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate their hypothesis on how the brain switches actions, the research team used a three-pronged approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they built a computational model of the brain, which aimed to simulate how the brain decides which action to perform, how it inhibits an ongoing action, and how it initiates a new action when the context changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used human participants to perform tasks involving reaching, stopping and switching movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the participants’ motor behavior to the simulated motor patterns generated by the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team has been working with Parkinson’s patients at Cedars Sinai and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to see the mechanism in action through patients’ recorded brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos’ co-author on the paper is the chair of Neurosurgery department at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Nader Pouratian. Shan Zhong, a postdoctoral researcher in the Alfred E. Mann Department, developed the computational models and acquired and analyzed the behavioral data for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new insight into one of the foundational aspects of human motor control could be an essential development for the 90,000 Americans diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients deal with longer reaction times and delays when they want to initiate movement, compared with those of us who don’t live with complex neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group of patients was of interest to the USC Viterbi research team because their treatment involves deep brain stimulation of the subcortical regions that control motor function — a prime opportunity to record brain activity to better understand the complex processes of motor regulation in this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said that when the patients in the test groups undergo the deep brain stimulation procedure, the surgeon accesses this region via a burr hole, inserting a long electrode that simultaneously allows brain activity to be monitored while they are awake during treatment. The procedure aims to treat Parkinson’s-related tremors by stimulating the subthalamic nucleus or STN region, which Christopoulos described as the brain’s natural braking system, a crucial component of the switching-gears mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how our brain stops our actions. For instance, we’ve all experienced that sensation when you freeze because you’re scared or surprised,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What happens to this area of the brain where you get scared is that it sends a signal to the brain to immediately stop whatever you’re doing. For Parkinson’s patients, this area is hyperactive and creates a tremor and bradykinesia (slowed movement).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The patients are awake and given a joystick. We show them the screen, and we show them tasks that involve reaching for targets, stopping an action and switching an action from one target to the other,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the next step is to take this data from the neurosurgeons and analyze it. We’re going to see how similar the predictions of our simulated model are to what actually happens in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said that the work had additional clinical value. Monitoring how Parkinson’s patients perform while under deep brain stimulation and how the treatment affects the brain could help clinicians avoid undue side effects and improve treatments for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing their computational model supported by carefully designed experiments, Christopoulos and his team are continuing to unravel the intricate neural mechanisms that underpin our most essential cognitive functions, paving the way for new discoveries and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by an NIH U01 award titled “Modeling and Mapping Human Action Regulation Networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#197874607b756c747c596c6a7a377c7d6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Amy Blumenthal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://usc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Amy Blumenthal – USC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Computational mechanism underlying switching of motor actions&lt;/a&gt;” by Vasileios Christopoulos et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational mechanism underlying switching of motor actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survival of species in an ever-changing environment requires a flexibility that extends beyond merely selecting the most appropriate actions. It also involves readiness to stop or switch actions in response to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although considerable research has been devoted to understanding how the brain switches actions, the computations underlying the switching process and how it relates to the selecting and stopping processes remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normative theory suggests that switching is simply an extension of the stopping process, during which a current action is first inhibited by an independent pause mechanism before a new action is generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This theory was challenged by the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which the switching process is implemented through a competition between the current and new actions, without engaging an independent pause mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To delineate the computations underlying these action regulation functions, we utilized a neurocomputational theory that models the process of selecting, stopping and switching reaching movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the model predictions in healthy individuals who performed reaches in dynamic and uncertain environments that often required stopping and switching actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that unlike the stopping process, switching does not necessitate a proactive pause mechanism to delay movement initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the switching and stopping processes seem to be implemented by different mechanisms at the planning phase of the reaching movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once the reaching movement has been initiated, the switching process seems to involve an independent pause mechanism if the new target location is unknown prior to movement initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a new understanding of the computations underlying action switching, contribute valuable insights into the fundamental neuroscientific mechanisms of action regulation, and open new avenues for future neurophysiological investigations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:24:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE93ZWxDQmRJT0RpZWZfc0M5UVZhazdsck5BY3V2d3hBdXJSbXhBVDd1WUlTbWtKZkxuN3cwZ2JIYXRxVm9RY0EwdlZIT3dxTWhiRnlJWkwzMmFJbUFLSTBVWTljZVlnOVJ3TEdmS2k4M1E5djg</guid></item><item><title>只需5分钟的运动即可促进大脑健康-神经科学新闻 | Just 5 Minutes of Exercise Can Boost Brain Health - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5oaS03djRObHo1U09RMU5pQ1J2UV9wTUpUTHRoZm1JVTNra3Z1ZjcyUktsUzhfLWdTaWhWVnJYd1BhTUcxdDU0ZWx2MWhNVG8wYXNPTlVOV1lWVkh3R1BtMG4tRlFsV1JUR3NheDhwOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that even small amounts of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, like brisk walking or jogging, can significantly improve brain health in older adults. Higher-intensity physical activity was linked to better processing speed, working memory, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, lower activity levels were associated with declines in cognitive performance. These findings highlight the power of even minor lifestyle changes to protect and enhance brain health as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Moderate-to-vigorous exercise improves processing speed, working memory, and executive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Steps Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Even adding just five minutes of higher-intensity exercise shows cognitive benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity Prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; How time is spent across the day can directly influence brain health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk, a splash of water aerobics, or even a light jog around the block – if your heart rate goes up then so too will your brain health according to new research from the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted in partnership with the US-based AdventHealth Research Institute, the new study found that staying active through moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is associated with significantly better processing speed, working memory, and executive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the biggest cognitive gains were seen among people who went from doing no moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, to even doing just five minutes, clearly illustrating the power of exercise for the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing data from 585 older adults (aged 65-80 years) in the USA-based IGNITE trial*, the study examined associations between time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity across the 24-hr day, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified a two-way relationship between ‘huff-and-puff’ physical activity and brain health: do more exercise and your brain health improves; but do less and it declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA researcher, Dr Maddison Mellow says the study highlights how small changes to your daily activities can have big impacts on your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are three mutually exclusive lifestyle behaviours in the 24-hour day – sleep, sedentary behaviour and physical activity – and how these interact to influence our health outcomes,” Dr Mellow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, we know that being more active can improve our sleep; or having a better night’s sleep could boost our energy levels to perform physical activity the next day. But what we don’t know is the optimal balance of time spent in each of these behaviours to maximise cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study we explored how different uses of time impact your brain. We found that higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity – that is, activity performed at higher intensities that increases your heart rate and breathing – was related to better cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, ‘huff-and-puff’ physical activity (like aerobic exercise) improves processing speed (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, the opposite was also true: lower levels of this higher intensity physical activity were related to poorer performance on these tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent across different genetic and demographic backgrounds. Interestingly, the findings did not extend to episodic memory (the what, where and when details of an event) or visuospatial function outcomes (your ability to recognise places and navigate through spaces).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-researcher, Dr Audrey Collins, says understanding the interplay between different activities could empower older people to make positive health changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are only 24 hours in a day, so every day, we make decisions about how we spend our time. For example, if we sleep for eight hours, then there’s 16 hours remaining for waking behaviours like physical activity or sedentary behaviour; that’s the basic reality,” Dr Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that how we choose to spend our time across the 24-hour day may be differentially related to our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that we need to prioritise physical activity – such as physical activity that gets our heart rates up, according to our findings – is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With one in six people in the world expected to be 60 years or older by 2030, we need to make sure we are supporting and empowering people to age well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this instance, we hope that knowledge is power: boost your physical activity and boost your brain health to stay fit and well as you age. However, these results are cross-sectional and need to be tested longitudinally and experimentally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The IGNITE study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA), University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS), and Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and involved a large, well-characterised sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults. Participants were, on average, 69.8 years of age, predominantly female (70%), and self-reported as inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and exercise research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5e4cbcbc4c7c0c98be8c4cbd6c3ccc0c9c1e5d0cbccd6c48bc0c1d08bc4d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annabel Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annabel Mansfield – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaf072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;24-Hour time use and cognitive performance in late adulthood: results from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) study&lt;/a&gt;” by Maddison Mellow et al. &lt;em&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24-Hour time use and cognitive performance in late adulthood: results from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study examined associations between 24-hour time-use composition (i.e. sleep, sedentary time, light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and cognitive performance and explored whether demographic or genetic factors moderated these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis included baseline data from cognitively unimpaired older adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 648) enrolled in the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise study. Time use was measured using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive domains were determined using a confirmatory factor analysis from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Linear regression models tested associations between time-use composition and cognitive factors, adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, apolipoprotein E4 (&lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt;) allele carriage and study site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interaction terms evaluated moderation of time use by age, sex, education and &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; status. We also examined the theoretical impact of reallocating time between time-use behaviours on cognitive performance using compositional isotemporal substitution methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-use composition was associated with processing speed (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 5.16, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002), working memory (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 4.81, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .003) and executive function/attentional control (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 7.09, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) but not episodic memory (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 2.28, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .078) or visuospatial function (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 2.26, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .081). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post hoc&lt;/em&gt; isotemporal substitution analyses found that significant associations were driven by time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), with lesser amounts of MVPA associated with poorer cognitive performance. There was no evidence of moderation by any tested factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing or decreasing MVPA, at the expense of time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour or light physical activity, may be related to individual variation in processing speed, executive function/attentional control and working memory in older adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:59:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5oaS03djRObHo1U09RMU5pQ1J2UV9wTUpUTHRoZm1JVTNra3Z1ZjcyUktsUzhfLWdTaWhWVnJYd1BhTUcxdDU0ZWx2MWhNVG8wYXNPTlVOV1lWVkh3R1BtMG4tRlFsV1JUR3NheDhwOA</guid></item><item><title>新研究显示，为什么美国各地的预期寿命差异很大，尤其是女性的预期寿命- NBC新闻 | Why life expectancy varies widely across the U.S. especially for women, new study reveals - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWnBWSkdsUmVDcjRwUm53YnUtT21zTXB0ZHNrbWdxdnN6TEI4UUx1b3AtcDEwZUpJTFNnQjZ5T0ZoUUJEZGw4US0yWTJXbkg0dVFBdGFFOXRHS25NNkExYWdseWY1SjJaamxkQjJ5bHpYc3NHVVViYzJ3M2JaU2RzdUFnWW00NW5Jd1pweXdSbk4zT0I2VTd2aVBPd9IBVkFVX3lxTE5OMDBtNVprZkxuSTg2U3NJc2NXMG80R05VVUF3dkxFV3VZT21EMUR3Wk1lVVpiRzYxQ1FlajFleHBzVGtOX0wwLTJZcV92MDZHOFJTdkpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;How long you live depends on where you live, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-life-expectancy-increase-rcna184502" target="_blank"&gt;Americans’ life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; increased throughout the 20th century, although in some states, particularly in the South, people aren’t living much longer than they were 100 years ago. It’s worse among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health analyzed the death data of 77 million women and 102 million men born from 1900 through 2000. The findings, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, showed that nationwide life expectancy for women increased from 73.8 to 84.1 in that time frame, while it jumped from 62.8 to 80.3 for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists and health officials calculate life expectancy at birth as a way of understanding a country’s health over time. How long people in the United States lived since the last century varied drastically by state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What was surprising to me was that for some states, especially for women, there’s basically no change,” said study co-author Theodore Holford, a senior research scientist in biostatistics at Yale University. “Over 100 years, in some of these Southern states, they improved less than two years in the framework of all of the medical advances that we have seen during the 20th century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The bottom five states for life expectancy among women born in 2000, compared to women born in 1900, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;West Virginia, 75.3, up from 74.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma, 76, down from 76.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kentucky, 76.5, up from 74.9.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi, 76.6, up from 73.2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas, 76.6, up from 75.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Southern men born in 2000 also tended to have lower life expectancies, though they showed greater improvements than women since 1900:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi, 71.8, up from 62.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;West Virginia, 72.6, up from 63.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alabama, 72.6, up from 62.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Louisiana, 72.9, up from 61.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tennessee 73.4, up from 63.6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Not all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/geographic-region.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Southern states&lt;/a&gt; show lower or stalled life expectancies for people born in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Florida, Texas and Virginia are among the Southern states featured in the top 20 of life expectancy for both men and women born in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;States outside the South that ranked in the bottom 10 for both sexes include Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also highlights life expectancy by state and sex at the midway point of 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Men in particular showed greater improvement during the first half of the century. In North Dakota, for example, male life expectancy jumped 10 years from 66.4 in 1900 to 76.5 in 1950, but only one year, 77.8, from 1950 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Data reflects the state in which a person died, not where they were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s well-established that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7829786/" target="_blank"&gt;women live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;, but this latest research unveils geographic disparities in life expectancy at a turning point in federal public health administration. Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;Robert F.

Socioeconomic differences among states also impact longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Marc Gourevitch, a professor in the department of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, said research shows that states with policies that support a more livable minimum wage and paid sick leave, as well as access to affordable medical care, are more likely to show significant life expectancy gains over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Focusing on policies that help people better meet their everyday needs promises to go a long way in improving life expectancy and, with it, giving more people a chance at getting to watch their grandchildren grow,” said Gourevitch, who wasn’t involved in the Yale study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women born in 2000 in the District of Columbia have both the highest life expectancy, 93 years, and the biggest improvement since 1900, when life expectancy was 63.9. Similarly, D.C. men born in 2000 have the third-highest life expectancy of 86.5 years, up from 48.7 at the start of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Urban areas tend to do a lot better than rural areas, presumably because of differences in access to health care,” Holford said of people living longer in the nation’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another change is the mix of the population in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Many more people moving into the area who would have a lot of the monetary advantages that would give them better access to things affecting their health,” Holford said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Which states have the highest life expectancy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;States with the longest life expectancies for women born in 2000 spanned both coasts and beyond the continental U.S.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New York, 91.9, up from 71.2. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California, 91.3, up from 73.6. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts, 88.8, up from 74.2. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hawaii, 88.7, up from 75.6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other than D.C., these states show the longest life expectancy among men born in 2000:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New York, 87.8, up from 60.1. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California, 86.8, up from 62.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts, 84.8, up from 63.4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washington, 84.3, up from 63.7. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Holford said the Yale study is part of his work with the National Cancer Institute’s &lt;a href="https://cisnet.cancer.gov" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)&lt;/a&gt;. A goal of this and other CISNET research is to help health departments address state-specific disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One downside to implementing promising public health policies, Holford said, is that it can take years  — even generations — to measure their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Nevertheless, it’s important to start it so that you put these things in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:52:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWnBWSkdsUmVDcjRwUm53YnUtT21zTXB0ZHNrbWdxdnN6TEI4UUx1b3AtcDEwZUpJTFNnQjZ5T0ZoUUJEZGw4US0yWTJXbkg0dVFBdGFFOXRHS25NNkExYWdseWY1SjJaamxkQjJ5bHpYc3NHVVViYzJ3M2JaU2RzdUFnWW00NW5Jd1pweXdSbk4zT0I2VTd2aVBPd9IBVkFVX3lxTE5OMDBtNVprZkxuSTg2U3NJc2NXMG80R05VVUF3dkxFV3VZT21EMUR3Wk1lVVpiRzYxQ1FlajFleHBzVGtOX0wwLTJZcV92MDZHOFJTdkpR</guid></item><item><title>我的丈夫想向他的家人隐瞒我们的怀孕。我不可能接受这个。-石板 | My Husband Wants to Hide Our Pregnancy From His Family.

He’s the one who catches and releases spiders. He jumps out of the car to help strangers. My issue here is with his family, my in-laws. For lack of a better term, they do not “adult.” They are currently living in the second house that has literally rotted down around them due to lack of upkeep. There is a tremendous amount of unchecked mental and physical illness; while they’re kind and loving, they are also unable to hold jobs. They start food fights in restaurants because it doesn’t occur to them that their behavior is ridiculous. There is hoarding on a few levels, depression, you name it. My husband didn’t feel like he had a real home until we moved in together and he noticed that we suddenly lived like functioning adults, because he had never experienced it.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001h3b73n88yfa9y@published"&gt;We are currently expecting our second baby. My husband does not want to share the news with his parents about our pregnancy for fear they will come visit. (Thankfully, we live far away from them.) He thinks about their situation and he cries. His frustration with seeing his family deteriorate, yet do nothing to get help or move forward, is very hard to watch. They have refused help every time we’ve offered, from helping put a new roof on their house or clean out the mess that the collapsed roof made. All to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001i3b73rvlxo6on@published"&gt;Their life choices have given us so much anxiety over the last few years that I am not sure how to support him. Yes, I do hold them in contempt for a multitude of reasons, but they do deserve to know they will have another grandchild. They adore our child (even though we have strict boundaries when they do visit) and would be thrilled at this news. And we can’t hide it indefinitely … the holidays would get awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001l3b736csj9jwz@published"&gt;Ugh, this is awful, and I feel for your husband. Still, I’m afraid that there is not much you can do from your position. He is clearly laboring under the weight of decades of trauma from dealing with these people, and whether or not they are objectively bad, they are certainly bad in your husband’s mind. Planning to never tell your family about the birth of a child is PRETTY EXTREME and a thing like that only comes as a response to something equally as extreme, at least in the mind of your husband. So, there are serious issues here that I’m sure need working out in therapy and over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpo001m3b73yw9qo7sr@published"&gt;Of course, we both know that it is patently absurd to hide a whole entire child from extended relatives and your husband is, quite frankly, tripping. And of course, you can tell him that. You can encourage him to be honest and you can let him know that there is no good ending to this plan. But if I were in your position, I would stop short of intervening on my own, outing the pregnancy myself, or otherwise taking control of the situation. The family relationships here are clearly messy enough that you would do well to avoid sticking your own foot any further into it than you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpo001n3b73bzcjal73@published"&gt;Tell your husband that in every way you think this is a bad idea. But keep in mind that in order to survive, people from traumatic backgrounds often have to explore all manner of methods for differentiation. He may just need time to enjoy the feeling of freedom that comes with this misguided notion before seeing the futility of it in practice. So, one good way to support him is to give him that time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lhwal002l3b73ktjndxws@published"&gt;I have a strange, not-really-a-problem problem. I had my daughter three months ago. I’ve always been tall and thin, and I had a 9-pound baby. I got back to my normal weight almost immediately, just due to good genes I guess. My issue is that women—co-workers, family, people on the street—are pretty mad at me. My co-worker this morning upon seeing me for the first time since returning to work said, “I hate you.” I know this is all meant as a compliment, but I’m really at a loss as to what to say. My mom died while I was pregnant so sometimes I’ve been saying it’s a gift from her (she was always naturally thin). I hate that I’m getting caught up in this scrutiny of women’s bodies and making people feel bad. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

She and her husband did not find out the sex of the baby prior. I have two girls, and my older brother has one girl. Upon receiving the group text from my brother-in-law that they had a healthy baby boy, my mother immediately texted back that she was hoping for a boy. That hurt. Are her three granddaughters not good enough?&lt;br&gt;My husband—who was really hoping we’d have a boy, but is still smitten with our two girls—is really upset about the comment. I’m not sure how my brother or his wife took the comment. My sister is already the favorite with my parents, and my husband is convinced that she will now get even more favoritism. We have plans to visit my parents later this summer (we live across the country from my sister and parents), and now my husband no longer wants to go. My husband and I are both excited and very happy for my sister and brother-in-law, but this is just one more thing my mom has said to take an apparent dig at us. I guess my question is, would it be inappropriate to call my mom out on this inappropriate comment? How would I go about doing that?&lt;/p&gt;

I understand your husband’s feelings, but I do not think the solution is to become further estranged over something so small. When you say “This is just one more thing my mom has said,” I think that bears a lot of weight here. When she says things that are &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;clear digs, address them in the moment. You’re building up too much resentment, and it’s spilling over into benign interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

In rats, those that helped distressed peers showed increased activation in empathy- and motivation-related brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These helpful rats also had higher oxytocin receptor expression, suggesting that social bonding, not just emotional distress recognition, may drive prosocial behavior. The findings offer new insights into how attachment and empathy shape helping behavior in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Helpful rats showed stronger activity in brain regions linked to empathy and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of Oxytocin:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher oxytocin receptor levels supported social bonding and increased helping behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosocial Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Caring for others, more than simply recognizing distress, may drive acts of kindness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are some people more helpful than others? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper, Inbal Bartal, from Tel Aviv University, and colleagues used rats to explore why some individuals may be more receptive to the distress of others and how this information leads to helpful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109305"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This work helps us understand prosocial, or helpful, acts better. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a task the researchers previously developed, they observed the behaviors and brain activity of helpful rats compared to less helpful rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this task that probes helping behavior, rats are given the option to release a distressed peer trapped in a restrainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats were more likely to come to the aid of others that they had previous positive social interactions with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These helpful rats had increased activity in brain regions associated with empathy and motivation compared to less helpful rats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed that helper rats had increased oxytocin receptor expression in a brain region that drives motivation compared to the less helpful rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this could mean that caring for others, more than relating to others’ distresses, contributes to helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When oxytocin signaling was inhibited, rats were less friendly with others, suggesting oxytocin may support helping by making rats feel attachment to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We appear to live in an increasingly polarized society where there is a gap in empathy towards others. This work helps us understand prosocial, or helpful, acts better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see others in distress all the time but tend to help only certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The similarity between human and rat brains helps us understand the way our brain mediates prosocial decisions,” says Bartel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and social behavior research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#402d252429210033262e6e2f3227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0845-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Individual Variability in Rat Helping Behavior: A Role for Social Affiliation and Oxytocin Receptors&lt;/a&gt;” by Inbal Bartal et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Individual Variability in Rat Helping Behavior: A Role for Social Affiliation and Oxytocin Receptors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prosocial response to others in distress is increasingly recognized as a natural behavior for many social species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed towards familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context, some individuals are more prone to help than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rat helping behavior test where animals can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer, most rats are motivated and consistently release the trapped rat (‘openers’), yet around 30% do not open the restrainer (‘non-openers’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural markers were compared between opener and non-opener rats in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door-opening compared to non-openers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the anterior insula, of openers. Several transcription control pathways were significantly upregulated in openers’ NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemogenetically inhibiting paraventricular oxytocin neurons did not significantly impair helping, but did reduce sociality measures, indicating that helping does not rely solely on oxytocin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate-early gene c-Fos in males revealed increased activity in openers in prosocial brain regions compared to non-openers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include regions associated with empathy in humans (insula, somatosensory, cingulate and frontal cortices), and motivation and reward regions such as the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBaX253aXc4cnVfRGF5a0sxQURqNDdpc1JMbUJITXlCS1llT1I2TmlNanZPdVJqaGpWdDk1a202OExqaXVvdGt5NHc4RmY5Q0k4TS00N1plMVVoeGlnaDhPRUp2MmZYTHlNREZ1TEpGU1k</guid></item><item><title>在直播中分享癌症诊断的心爱的电视主播对疾病进行了戏剧性的更新-每日邮报 | Beloved TV anchor who shared cancer diagnosis live on air gives dramatic update on disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNSFFxZF9ybjZpVWtZRmVGQS1weDlud1Z6eU1HWEZLWHVJbzBrWDM1VjdDNHRFdi1PUjZyVWxudTlBVkJwd0ZRRlgzT01aeWxITm1OaHVTdEVrX0JFQVpZcVRjdDhFY2lOWEtGakN0VGxFbDFwOHBLckprX0tUYkZKMi1la1NzNnNxd09ZakVrWURpLWJUY1BXRDRuTWZvamxETGhV0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1LQ0RvYUNwb3FYQTlKQXlaOFYydGc3Qm9hTGlUOTQtRjh0NUoyeXdQWWNJZnZzRFBGejNaajhMc3pMVnlKcnBVWERWSGtBTnNPWF80SzVCMzB3dzliSFIwakozMGR4cTYyWEkzZEludFlUZlJabWhrUEN0RlpPUHFiQW9sU0JrRzFLeGZEdF9HQnRoWXQ2QmJ4UmRpUTc0bzNUWlZuN0laZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A beloved &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-f0fecab0-24f6-11f0-81f4-0ff5c46a8d51"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; news anchor gave a positive update about his battle with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-27a3bd90-2502-11f0-8bf1-1dc27744397b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;  after opening up about his diagnosis last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wgntv.com/news/chicago-news/cancer-sucks-wgn-reporter-mike-lowe-reveals-stage-3-colon-cancer-diagnosis/"&gt;WGN-TV&lt;/a&gt; reporter Mike Lowe's latest test results revealed that his colorectal cancer was no longer detectable after a yearlong battle with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting those results, it was just the most amazing feeling,' Lowe told the &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/28/wgn-mike-lowe-cancer/"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think back to one year ago, when I went to the initial doctor's appointment... In some ways it feels like forever and in some ways, it feels like the blink of an eye - but what a year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past year, Lowe has shared his journey with WGN, allowing cameras into his appointments and raising awareness about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anchor shared his Stage 3 diagnosis on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7B1Fxsg3qS/?img_index=9"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer sucks, but it's growing on me. I wanted to let you know that I was diagnosed with Stage 3(c)/N+ colon cancer, and I'll be participating in a clinical trial with Northwestern Medicine,' he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowe said that he would be undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for six months before undergoing surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;WGN-TV reporter Mike Lowe's latest test results revealed that his cancer was no longer detectable after a yearlong battle with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over the last year, Lowe has shared his journey with viewers, allowing cameras into his appointments and raising awareness about the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In May 2024, Lowe shared his diagnosis of Stage 3 colorectal cancer, the same type that Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman died from in 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that 'Stage 3 is serious,' noting that Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8676047/Black-Panther-actor-Chadwick-Boseman-dies-43-battle-cancer.html"&gt;died from Stage 3 colon cancer in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I'm staying 100 percent positive. I've got a great team of doctors, all of whom say this could be curable cancer...It's worth noting that colon cancer is rising rapidly in younger people (20s,30s, and 40s),' Lowe wrote, urging viewers to get a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I haven't even reached the age recommended for a routine screening, which is 45. So, if you're experiencing symptoms like constipation or abdominal pain, go see a doctor.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reporter told the Chicago Tribune that the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12156615/Cancer-epidemic-young-people-laid-bare-colorectal-cancer-cases-40s-DOUBLED-2030.html"&gt;alarming increase of colon cancer in young people&lt;/a&gt; is 'a public health crisis in this country.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Younger and younger people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last 30 years, diagnoses of the disease in younger people have shot up by 80 percent across the globe, research suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates of the disease in older groups, who are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with it, have either declined or remained stable over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People aged 54 or younger made up about 20 percent of colorectal cancer cases in 2019, a percentage that has doubled from 1995, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'It's worth noting that colon cancer is rising rapidly in younger people (20s,30s, and 40s),' Lowe wrote, as he urged viewers to get a colonoscopy.

'Mike has been extraordinarily brave to share his story, and there's no doubt in my mind that it's going to benefit a huge amount of people who are going to go for early colorectal cancer screenings so they can catch it in a time where we can intervene in a meaningful way.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowe shared his journey with viewers and continued to work as much as possible while he was undergoing treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted cancer to be something important that was going on in the background of my life but not completely dominating it,' he told the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could have a real purpose and go to work and feel like I was able to do it and do it well still, then I was going to do it no matter what.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,' Lowe said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lowe continued working as much as he could, including rushing from cancer treatments in the morning to work or keeping a zippered pouch across his chest which contained medicine moving through a tube to a port in his chest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued working as much as he could, including rushing from treatments in the morning to work or keeping a zippered pouch across his chest that contained medicine moving through a tube to a port in his chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were certain setbacks, but he just tackled each and every one of them and wanted to keep working as much as he could,' said WGN-TV News Director Dominick Stasi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He approached the whole thing with a positive attitude. It was really kind of inspiring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anchor experienced increasingly difficult symptoms as his treatment continued, including nausea, numbness in his extremities, and peeling on his feet and palms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he rarely took much medical leave from his job and instead brought the camera crew with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,' Lowe told the Tribune. 'If you can help anybody understand what they're about to go through, I think that helps, and the position of a journalist is to do that, to explain things and make them more understandable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January, after his treatments, he had an MRI and a sigmoidoscopy to see if the cancer was still present. If it was, he would next need to undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he was given tentatively good news: The doctor couldn't see the tumor anymore, the Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The anchor experienced increasingly difficult symptoms as his treatment continued, including nausea, numbness in his extremities, and peeling on his feet and palms.

Imaging tests were ordered, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After a CT scan, an ER doctor came in “and just kind of said, ‘Tumor this’ and ‘Tumor that,’” she recalled. “That’s how we found out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The diagnosis: Stage 4 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/adrenocortical/patient/adrenocortical-treatment-pdq" target="_blank"&gt;adrenocortical carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She had a baseball-size tumor on her adrenal gland, several tumors in her liver and several in her lungs that were marble to golf ball size. The cancer was aggressive and growing quickly, Matt Goodrich says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is adrenocortical carcinoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The adrenal glands are two small organs located above each kidney. Their outer layer produces hormones important for the body to function properly, including controlling water balance, blood pressure and the stress response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-endocrine-tumor/adrenocortical-carcinoma" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Adrenocortical carcinoma is a cancer that develops in this outer layer of the adrenal glands. It’s more common in women than men. The average age of onset is 46, according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/adrenocortical-carcinoma" target="_blank"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms include abdominal pain or fullness, fluid retention, bloating and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A tumor can produce too many hormones, which is what happened to Angela Goodrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s just a very strange cancer,” she noted, likening some of the effects to end of pregnancy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her cortisol levels became “super high,” Matt Goodrich says, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000407.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cushing syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — a disorder that causes a round full face, weight gain, fat around the midsection, back and bone pain and mental changes such as confusion. It’s also associated with low potassium levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cancer runs in families 50% of the time, but Angela Goodrich said she had no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There were few treatment options available since so many tumors had already grown in her body by the time the cancer was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She began chemotherapy just before Easter. The family was grateful to people who brought meals, cleaned the house and offered help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I really appreciate all the support and love we’ve received from the community and friends and family, and just from everywhere. So a lot of gratitude,” Angela Goodrich told TODAY.com the day before she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg" alt="Goodrich recently became a grandmother."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Goodrich recently became a grandmother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Matt Goodrich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her cancer was extremely advanced and her body was failing before she started chemotherapy, her husband says.

The findings suggest vasopressin deficiency may underlie social difficulties seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeys given vasopressin became more responsive to prosocial cues and better at remembering faces, critical skills often impaired in ASD. This work opens new avenues for precision therapies aimed at addressing core social deficits in autism rather than just managing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Gains Without Aggression:&lt;/strong&gt; Vasopressin improved prosocial behavior and facial memory without increasing aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Link to ASD:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-social monkeys naturally mirror some social impairments seen in humans with autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Vasopressin supplementation could offer a future targeted treatment for core social deficits in ASD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Florida Institute of Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years, Florida Tech’s Catherine Talbot, an assistant professor of psychology, has worked to understand the sociality of male rhesus monkeys and how low-social monkeys can serve as a model for humans with autism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her most recent findings show that replenishing a deficient hormone, vasopressin, helped the monkeys become more social without increasing their aggression—a discovery that could change autism treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109297"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One of Talbot’s co-authors has already begun translating this work to cohorts of autism patients. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that one in 36 children in the United States is affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). That’s an increase from one in 44 children reported in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two FDA-approved treatments currently exist, Talbot said, but they only address associated symptoms, not the root of ASD. The boost in both prevalence and awareness of the disorder prompts the following question: What is the cause?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rhesus monkeys are naturally low-social, meaning they demonstrate poor social cognitive skills, while others are highly social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their individual variation in sociality is comparable to how human sociality varies, ranging from people we consider social butterflies to those who are not interested in social interactions, similar to some people diagnosed with ASD, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her goal has been to understand how variations in biology and behavior influence social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a research paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, Talbot and researchers with Stanford, the University of California, Davis and the California National Primate Research Center explored vasopressin, a hormone that is known to contribute to mammalian social behavior, as a potential therapeutic treatment that may ultimately help people with autism better function in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work from this research group had found that vasopressin levels are lower in their low-social rhesus monkey model, as well as in a select group of people with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies testing vasopressin in rodents had found that increased hormone levels caused more aggression. As a result, researchers warned against administering vasopressin as a treatment, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she argued that in those studies, vasopressin induced aggression in contexts where aggression is the socially appropriate response, such as guarding mates in their home territory, so the hormone may promote species-typical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that the previous studies tested vasopressin in “neurotypical” rodents, as opposed to animals with low-social tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that individuals with the lowest levels of vasopressin may benefit the most from it—that is the step forward toward precision medicine that we now need to study,” Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her latest paper, Talbot and her co-authors tested how low-social monkeys with low vasopressin levels and high autistic-like trait burden responded to vasopressin supplementation to make up for their natural deficiency. They administered the hormone through a nebulizer, into which the monkeys could opt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few minutes each week, the monkeys voluntarily held their faces up to a nebulizer to receive their dose while sipping white grape juice—a favorite among the monkeys, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After administering the hormone and verifying that it increased vasopressin levels in the central nervous system, the researchers wanted to see how the monkeys responded to both affiliative and aggressive stimuli by showing them videos depicting these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also compared their ability to recognize and remember new objects and faces, which is another important social skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that normally low-social monkeys do not respond to social communication and were better at recognizing and remembering objects compared to faces, similar to some humans diagnosed with ASD. When the monkeys were given vasopressin, they began reciprocating affiliative, pro-social behaviors, but not aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also improved their facial recognition memory, making it equivalent to their recognition memory of objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, vasopressin “rescued” low-social monkeys’ ability to respond prosocially to others and to remember new faces. The treatment was successful—vasopressin selectively improved the social cognition of these low-social monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting to see this come to fruition after pouring so much work into this project and overcoming so many challenges,” Talbot said of her findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Talbot’s co-authors has already begun translating this work to cohorts of autism patients. She expects more clinical trials to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immediate future, Talbot is examining how other, more complex social cognitive abilities like theory of mind—the ability to take the perspective of another—may differ in low-social monkeys compared to more social monkeys and how this relates to their underlying biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Talbot hopes that they can target young monkeys who are at risk of developing social deficits related to autism for vasopressin treatment, to see if early intervention might help change their developmental trajectory and eventually translate this therapy to targeted human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Autism and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Madeline Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Madeline Taylor – Florida Institute of Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2418635121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nebulized vasopressin penetrates CSF and improves social cognition without inducing aggression in a rhesus monkey model of autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Catherine F.

Test 1: Placebo-administered monkeys lacked face recognition memory, whereas face recognition memory was “rescued” following AVP administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, object recognition memory was intact and did not differ between administration conditions. Test 2: Placebo-administered monkeys did not respond to conspecific social communication cues, whereas following AVP administration, they reciprocated affiliative communication cues with species-typical affiliative responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, AVP administration did not increase aggressive responses to conspecific aggressive or affiliative overtures. Study 2 (N = 4) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this administration method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following AVP nebulization, we observed a linear increase in cisternal CSF AVP levels, and a quadratic rise and fall in blood AVP levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that nebulized AVP likely penetrates the central nervous system, selectively promotes species-typical responses to social information, and does not induce aggression in low-social individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nebulized AVP therefore may hold promise for managing similar social symptoms in people with autism, particularly in very young or lower functioning individuals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:42:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE95N3BJRXhJYlFudnNFbk5YSG9MbU5yUEZtTG14d3FQV0NiT3hjRlJUb1J5OHJBUTI0bWVNTkFJOTFNTk9jeXhWd29fbEpnT1V5TWticTFDQmJCUWxKUnZMUHBvNzFfcURZUkE</guid></item><item><title>专家正在告诉我们您的月经如何严重影响这个身体部位- BuzzFeed | Experts Are Telling Us How Your Period Can Seriously Impact This One Body Part - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1ObG9USjhmZ2R2cXVLdmVTV0Z6UHJ3Z2pDYVdGdU1WenBCSGFfVGxXa19talpWeG1QbEthbnZCTGw4N3lJVW9WUUg4aTRtSF9GcEdscDJBUU5qMG1udmttb0xXbHB2LUU0ZzQwczVZcmUtSFctaHRpR3hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;“Hormonal fluctuations during your menstrual cycle can cause your gums to be more sensitive and prone to inflammation,” &lt;a href="https://bhdentalarts.com/about/meet-dr-rajpal/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Anjali Rajpal&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and founder of Beverly Hills Dental Arts, told HuffPost. “The hormonal changes can cause your gums to be more reactive to the bacteria in plaque, increasing the chances of gingivitis or early stage gum disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reaction specifically stems from the change in estrogen and progesterone levels before and during your period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As estrogen levels increase, there is more blood flow to the gums, and progesterone can also increase inflammation, sometimes making the gums more reactive,” said &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1023156627/margaret-nachtigall" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Margaret Nachtigall&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive endocrinologist and clinical associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of these hormonal shifts, your gum tissue might become more swollen and tender and even bleed. Redness and irritation are common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s somewhat like how hormones can impact your mood ― they similarly influence your oral tissues and their response to daily stresses like microbes,” said &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fluctuations temporarily alter the environment of your mouth and shift the balance of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher estrogen and progesterone levels cause the blood vessels in the gingival tissues to dilate, making them more sensitive, swollen, and also prone to bleeding,” said &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.instagram.com_dr.erin.ortho_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=l8J-SPajWqKM0HqnabEg6YaOmCZlOSGFcU6_RHN2n64&amp;amp;m=t2w5s3IGnw6hUij-x62FpbY-LCqke1kWEua5ClBfhgPdX1iMVoFyz7NbZPutajep&amp;amp;s=GJc6wWGS8XHQ7nLAxObqrPgXL1f3gV9vocmPmweN9Oc&amp;amp;e=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860"&gt;Dr. Erin Fraundorf&lt;/a&gt;, an orthodontist and founder of &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.boca-2Dstudio.com_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=l8J-SPajWqKM0HqnabEg6YaOmCZlOSGFcU6_RHN2n64&amp;amp;m=t2w5s3IGnw6hUij-x62FpbY-LCqke1kWEua5ClBfhgPdX1iMVoFyz7NbZPutajep&amp;amp;s=0AfeQiIn5zx5PZHcus3l4pBnpkcTDwXIGOpIESW7IcI&amp;amp;e=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Boca Studio&lt;/a&gt;. “Similar to bloating in other parts of the body during menstruation, gum tissues may retain additional fluid, adding to the feeling of tenderness or puffiness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that you might experience a heightened immune response during this time as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, the progesterone can affect how the collagen of the gingiva gets produced, and it can affect the capillary permeability as well,” said &lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/christine-carlan-greves-md#/overview" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Christine Greves&lt;/a&gt;, an OB-GYN at Orlando Health Women’s Institute Center for Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynecology. “This can result in the production of more prostaglandins, which are basically compounds that can cause inflammation and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also refer to this phenomenon as “menstruation gingivitis.” Similar conditions can occur during puberty and pregnancy as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women or people taking birth control pills can notice changes in their gum health,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.toothclub.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sepideh Jalali&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist with The Tooth Club. “And if you are dealing with PCOS, endometriosis, or hormone therapy, your gums will become more sensitive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can your menstrual cycle affect your oral health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

They also underscore the “very real consequences” that cancer treatment can have for women after they’ve entered remission, said Joseph Unger, a biostatician and cancer researcher with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cancer treatments are becoming more effective at keeping patients alive and turning cancer into more of a chronic disease,” said Unger, who studies cancer patients’ quality of life. “Understandably, patients don’t want to just live, they want to live well. So, that’s really where this research helps to point us in the next direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Simo Du, lead author of the study and internal medicine resident physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, had noticed that many more female than male cancer survivors in her clinic were complaining of fatigue that made it hard to shop for groceries, get dressed, shower and do other social or hygiene-related activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To better understand how this disparity affected patients’ quality of life, Du and her colleagues analyzed responses from 1,555 adult &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-describe-signs-ignored-rcna129838" target="_blank"&gt;cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt; that were included in the 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Participants answered questions about whether they feel hopeless, deal with poor appetite, experience trouble sleeping and have thoughts of self-harm. They also completed questionnaires about the type of physical activities they participate in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the researchers said, the responses could be extrapolated to 25 million survivors with over 20 different types of cancer across the U.S., including those of the prostate, breast, skin, colon and cervix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why women have worse quality of life after cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study found that, compared with male survivors, female cancer survivors were 69% more likely to report cancer-related fatigue and 58% more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/depression-cancer-patients-oncology-gap-anxiety-rcna179852" target="_blank"&gt;report depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While fatigue is already known to affect &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue" target="_blank"&gt;more than 80% of people with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the study found that women were 1.5 times more likely than men to experience it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer treatments affect the entire body, as they can kill both cancerous and healthy cells, said Carolyn Gotay, cancer researcher and professor emeritus of population and public health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. These effects can persist for months to years after treatment is done, she said, leaving survivors with a host of health issues from deafness to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer-related fatigue and depression can be caused by cancer itself or the other medical conditions it causes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The emotional impact of dealing with the disease can also cause these symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Why women bear the brunt of these effects remains unclear, although experts have some theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research shows that women have stronger immune responses to treatments, which causes greater inflammation. Women also tend to clear drugs from their bodies more slowly than men, Du said, leading to higher concentrations of medications in their system and thus worse symptoms. It’s possible, too, that differences in body size affect how drugs and radiation are distributed and absorbed in women’s bodies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women are also more likely to develop cancers that are treated with hormone therapies that can contribute greatly to fatigue and depression, Du said. Some of these therapies, like &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;tamoxifen&lt;/a&gt; that’s used to treat some breast cancers, are taken for five to 10 years after remission to lower the chances the cancer returns, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That said, women are more likely to report &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2025.2490212?src=" target="_blank"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression/art-20047725" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; even without a cancer diagnosis, Gotay said, so it’s possible that sex-related hormone differences might better explain why women experience more of these symptoms from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Du said that it’s also possible social gender norms play a role. Women typically have more caretaker responsibilities like tending to children and chores that can increase stress and contribute to fatigue and depression, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Notably, the study found that men were more likely to have thoughts “that they would be better off dead,” Du said. This finding mirrors other data that shows &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html#:~:text=Suicide%20rate%20disparities&amp;amp;text=The%20suicide%20rate%20among%20males,but%20nearly%2080%25%20of%20suicides.&amp;amp;text=Data%20table%20showing%20data%20for%20the%20chart%20figure.,-SexPress%20command" target="_blank"&gt;suicide rates are generally higher in men&lt;/a&gt; than in women. Du speculated that social norms, namely expectations that men should be able to provide for their families, could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How exercise can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also found that, among all cancer survivors, those who did moderate physical activity such as walking or cycling had a 50% lower risk of cancer-related fatigue. Those who participated in more vigorous activity didn’t see any improvements in their energy, Du said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Meanwhile, both moderate and vigorous activity was associated with a two- to five-fold decrease in depression risk, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the results suggest that post-cancer therapy programs should prioritize exercise. A &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.24.00541#:~:text=Prevalence%20estimates%20indicate%20that%2030,or%20years%20after%20treatment%20completion." target="_blank"&gt;2024 review of 113 randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions, and found that exercise, along with cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs, improved cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We always prescribe medications” to help cancer survivors cope with lingering symptoms, Du said. “But for cancer-related fatigue, exercise may actually work better than pharmaceutical interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Even still, exercise may be a bandage solution, Unger said, treating just the symptom and not the root cause. Future research needs to investigate why women experience worse side effects after cancer so they can benefit from more effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the meantime, Gotay said she hopes the study helps normalize the idea that it’s OK to not feel OK after surviving cancer, which can be tough for many survivors to understand and accept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“When people survive cancer and have fatigue or depression, they think that something is wrong with them because they’re not grateful,” Gotay said. “But they shouldn’t feel alone … or as though they’re deficient.

A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d of&lt;/em&gt; 0.43–1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:45:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1GQXp4N2hkNWVkcUd3Y0cwVDloODJfZXpMbmt3OEtlWEpjc1licHpWVW5YZ3NtREIwdEIydDdDSnUxekoyUWx6MDFlcnR4THFxZWdMaW9iVzhQb3c2UWhvUWtxczd6eHJvUW13QlFoeFItQlVJeVZxX0wwNkNGbUE</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品与全球过早死亡人数上升相关-神经科学新闻 | Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Rising Premature Deaths Worldwide - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study across eight countries shows that higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) is significantly linked to increased premature deaths. Researchers found that each 10% rise in UPFs’ share of total energy intake raises all-cause mortality risk by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries with the highest UPF consumption, like the U.S., see up to 14% of premature deaths attributed to these foods. The findings highlight the urgent need for global policies promoting healthier, minimally processed diets to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPF-Mortality Link:&lt;/strong&gt; A 10% increase in ultraprocessed food intake raises all-cause mortality risk by 3%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; In high-UPF countries like the U.S., nearly 14% of premature deaths are linked to UPF consumption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent Action Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Policies promoting fresh, minimally processed foods are essential to curb rising deaths globally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study analyzing data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) shows that premature deaths attributable to consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) increase significantly according to their share in individuals’ total energy intake. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, appearing in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt; reinforces the call for global action to reduce UPF consumption, supported by regulatory and fiscal policies that foster healthier environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs are ready-to-eat-or-heat industrial formulations that are made with ingredients extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories, with little or no whole foods in their composition. These have gradually been replacing traditional foods and meals made from fresh and minimally processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator of the study Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, DSc, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazil, says, “UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavors and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all-causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies focused on specific dietary risk factors instead of food patterns, the current study modeled data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) to link dietary patterns, considering the extent and purpose of industrial food processing, to deaths from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson explains, “We first estimated a linear association between the dietary share of UPFs and all-cause mortality, so that each 10% increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then, using the relative risks and the food consumption data for all countries (ranging from 15% of the total energy intake in Colombia, to over 50% of the calories in the United States), we built a model that estimated that the percentage of all-cause premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in 2018, 124,000 premature deaths were attributable to the consumption of UPFs in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High consumption of UPFs has been associated with 32 different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, some types of cancer, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, this study has estimated the burden of UPF intake on premature deaths from all-causes in different countries, showing that the attributable mortality is significant in all settings and that addressing UPF consumption should be a global public nutrition priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson notes, “It is concerning that, while in high-income countries UPF consumption is already high but relatively stable for over a decade, in low- and middle-income countries the consumption has continuously increased, meaning that while the attributable burden in high-income countries is currently higher, it is growing in the other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that policies that disincentivize the consumption of UPFs are urgently needed globally, promoting traditional dietary patterns based on local fresh and minimally processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Astrid Engelen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Astrid Engelen – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.02.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Premature Mortality Attributable to Ultraprocessed Food Consumption in 8 Countries&lt;/a&gt;” by Eduardo A.F.

Prospective cohort studies have consistently found an association between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased risk of several noncommunicable diseases and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to (1) estimate the risk of all-cause mortality for ultraprocessed foods consumption and (2) estimate the attributable epidemiologic burden of ultraprocessed food consumption in 8 select countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a dose–response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies was performed to assess the association between ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality and estimated the pooled RR for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the percentage ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the population attributable fractions for premature all-cause mortality attributable to the ultraprocessed foods in consumption were estimated in 8 select countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the U.S.) ultraprocessed food consumption. Analysis was conducted in November 2023–July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis showed a linear dose–response association between the ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality (RR for each 10% increase in percentage ultraprocessed food=1.03; 95% CI=1.02, 1.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the magnitude of the association between ultraprocessed foods intake and all-cause mortality and the ultraprocessed food dietary share number (percentage ultraprocessed food) in each of the 8 selected countries, estimations varied from 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and U.S.) of premature deaths attributable to ultraprocessed food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support that ultraprocessed food intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries, and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:19:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt</guid></item><item><title>吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果可以帮助血压- Surrey Live | Blood pressure can be helped by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of us probably don't need telling that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables is good for our health&lt;/a&gt;. The more you can eat over the course of, say, a week, the more nutrients you will be getting into your body and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Similarly, most of us will also have heard a lot about the importance of vitamins to your body's health. But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their essential role in how our body functions. One of those is magnesium. So important is it, in fact, that it is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and they don't need to involve obscure and expensive foods or supplements. You can get more magnesium from eating the sorts of foods you can come across easily in any supermarket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why is magnesium important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; It may also play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that good magnesium levels helps your heart health and one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in lots of fruits, but topping the list is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 68 grams of magnesium per cup (a cup is a US measure equivalent to about 250ml in the UK — it's harder to convert that into grams). One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, chia seeds and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like guava, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwi and figs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N</guid></item><item><title>我是一名顶级医生-您只需要一种补充剂......我花了数年时间将其驳回是错误的-每日邮报 | I'm a top doctor - there's only one supplement you need...and I was wrong to spend years dismissing it - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeEFSX21xeWE5WUl4UlhXMDlPUGY3bEZZcHo5VkM3c1ZXd184U0Nqb3JIS3pUdEVUUFVLQW5lb1YxVGgxRjRFV203c1kzZnFHdWhGMkVNcDJaTUMzX1E0UGczMktmdEFlbEo4eGx3MXF2dEFBRkJNOUlKSGJaR3VRSHpxWGFWSUE5S3ZGLTNKSWRRZm_SAZgBQVVfeXFMTTlWYmx0SWs4T1JKVlRxNHVwdFB3ak9xWkZKMjJEZGVtOVVyS3hrdUpGc1hxZkZFQ1dGbUdkSTk4OHJpcTJZSlEwRFFTWDMtTWJIdnd0REQ0eHRvSHhMcGF2NTZnMk8wdU9GNG5ET1E4di1uWWp5WTI5b1VidkZyUWRIYzlJbVQ5azl6TmxhaWEwUDllVDB3dGE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-dad38410-241a-11f0-a622-2776649f5518" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; doctor has urged the public to seek an annual blood test to check for vitamin D deficiency — after he was shocked to discover he was severely lacking in the vital nutrient and risking bone problems, despite his healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karan Rajan, a surgeon working in NHS hospitals, revealed the scare led him to u-turn on his sceptical views on vitamin D supplements, and now recommends them to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking in a video that has so far been &lt;/span&gt;watched over 45,000 times, Dr Rajan warned of the little-known dangers of not getting enough of the nutrient — which include bone deformities, muscle weakness and incorrect growth patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently estimated that around one in six adults in the UK do not get enough vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the 'sunshine vitamin', the main source is exposure to sunlight, as well as from foods like oily fish, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14531051/Jake-Moscato-red-meat-diet-anxiety-cholesterol.html"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and egg yolks.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was wrong about vitamin D,' Dr Rajan admitted in the clip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At first I thought only certain people needed it at certain times. At other times I thought it was just a scam.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The truth is, it took me being vitamin D deficient to change my mind.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rajan listed other vitamins and minerals such as magnesium which help promote the production of useable vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NHS guidelines suggest taking a vitamin D supplement throughout winter, when there is less sunshine, but Dr Rajan wasn't convinced this was necessary until his health scare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I discovered that my vitamin D levels were so low, I had to make a choice. I could have changed my diet and spent more time outdoors which I did, but I wanted to get back to sufficient levels as quickly as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor's vitamin D blood levels were 15.7 ng/ml, making him severely deficient according to the minimum threshold of 20ng/ml, set out by the institute of medicine in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UK threshold for deficiency is much lower, at 12ng/ml, a level that has long been criticised by international health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking with experts in the field, Dr Rajan decided to introduce vitamin D supplements to his daily routine, but with a 'twist'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He 'mega-dosed' the supplement, taking 17,000 units for 12 days, before before reducing his intake to 6,000 units for a maintenance dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four weeks later, Dr Rajan's vitamin D levels had surged to 66.2 ng/ml, proving that taking supplements can help to boost levels of the vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is definitely not what the guidelines suggest but me experimenting on myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rajan's vitamin D levels were well below the recommended daily guidelines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learned there are factors you need to take into consideration...but there is no reason why you shouldn't try supplementing with vitamin D for a specific period of time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan listed the best ways to boost levels of vitamin D, and how to take supplements responsibly to protect against bone fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, who has over 2.16million subscribers, urged anyone over the age of 30 to test regularly to see if they are lacking in any essential vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'My best advice is test don't guess. At least once a year, get a blood test as a general indicator of health and find out your vitamin D levels too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added there are many factors you need to take into consideration when it comes to vitamin D supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, the amount of vitamin D people need will depend on a variety of variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, adequate magnesium is needed for our body to process vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without enough of it, the so-called sunshine vitamin cannot be converted into a form the body can absorb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before his health scare, Dr Rajan was skeptical about the benefits of taking vitamin D supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning its best taken with foods naturally high in healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, those with lower levels of magnesium in their blood may need a higher dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Secondly, &lt;span&gt;being overweight can also have an impact on how much vitamin D, which is stored in fat cells, can be absorbed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more fat cells you have, the less vitamin D is available to the rest of the body,' Dr Karan explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan&lt;span&gt; said eating more foods that are naturally high in healthy fats and magnesium—such as nuts, spinach and dark chocolate—will help boost absorption rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggested looking for supplements that contain vitamin K2, which helps to reduce the risk of calcium being deposited in the bloodstream, risking heart disease, which can happen if you take too much generic vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The time of day you take your supplement doesn't seem to be important but consistency is', Dr Rajan added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggested taking the supplements for a period of between four and eight weeks before getting another blood test to see if target levels have been achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'While supplements can help to boost vitamin D levels, adequate sunlight exposure and a healthy diet that includes things like oily fish, mushrooms and fortified foods are the biggest levers to pull for everyone'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:23:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeEFSX21xeWE5WUl4UlhXMDlPUGY3bEZZcHo5VkM3c1ZXd184U0Nqb3JIS3pUdEVUUFVLQW5lb1YxVGgxRjRFV203c1kzZnFHdWhGMkVNcDJaTUMzX1E0UGczMktmdEFlbEo4eGx3MXF2dEFBRkJNOUlKSGJaR3VRSHpxWGFWSUE5S3ZGLTNKSWRRZm_SAZgBQVVfeXFMTTlWYmx0SWs4T1JKVlRxNHVwdFB3ak9xWkZKMjJEZGVtOVVyS3hrdUpGc1hxZkZFQ1dGbUdkSTk4OHJpcTJZSlEwRFFTWDMtTWJIdnd0REQ0eHRvSHhMcGF2NTZnMk8wdU9GNG5ET1E4di1uWWp5WTI5b1VidkZyUWRIYzlJbVQ5azl6TmxhaWEwUDllVDB3dGE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，子宫内膜异位症与免疫疾病有关-英国广播公司 | Endometriosis and immune diseases linked, study shows -

The United States allows nine kinds of phthalates to be used in food packaging. They are an example of what scientists call “&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/what-edcs-are/common-edcs"&gt;endocrine-disrupting chemicals&lt;/a&gt;,” which can tweak and change the hormones in the body, causing multiple health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WUO633LGRJENPCMOUZED77RLYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that phthalates are toxic chemicals,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive health at the University of California at San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide: In 2021, an estimated 20 million people died because of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TTECCONT4ZCGHIKFN7EORPSDHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Trasande says that while 13 percent may seem like a high number, phthalate exposure may overlap with and exacerbate other risks. Phthalates are believed to create excess inflammation in the body, and they are linked with other conditions that increase heart disease mortality, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Some of the increased risk of heart disease from obesity, for example, could be from phthalates.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The chemicals are also found more commonly in highly processed foods, another risk factor for death from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SFMYAPCRKJDQHIDRNVWM2WAYZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists estimate that air pollution, which contains tiny plastic particles, is linked to 20 percent of all cardiovascular deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTAY4YH73NCSTA5JSUON3XHZMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; — albeit with a small sample size — has also found that the presence of microplastics or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/08/microplastics-nanoplastics-bottled-water-study/"&gt;nanoplastics &lt;/a&gt;in the carotid artery increases the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. Researchers are trying to understand the extent to which those tiny plastics can carry chemicals like phthalates with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FN6LZ3SQ3ZCSNO7LJSHSEOOUF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But people with more phthalates in their bodies are probably more exposed to plastics, and therefore to microplastics and nanoplastics as well, Trasande said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z3GNQSITMVFD5NEQ7APXUB545M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It could be the chemicals that are being delivered, or it could be the micro and nanoplastics,” said Trasande. “And that’s really where the field needs to go scientifically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IG4247DYFJF55MVISMICOK7TPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other research looking at deaths from phthalates has come to similar results. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680769/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published late last year found that phthalates were responsible for about 164,000 deaths worldwide in 2015, most due to heart disease and high blood pressure. That study examined just 40 countries, while the new study looked at around 190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6QW3HLB7BBRXMYUHUOI7JKTME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#sec4-jcdd-07-00026"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found connections between phthalates and heart disease, some researchers say more human studies would help solidify the link. “It would be important to have someone do a systematic review on phthalates and cardiovascular events,” said Woodruff. “But it’s just a new area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3OVKDOXSLRH3ZAUSEYSVQLCJ24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For now, scientists continue to push for more monitoring of the chemicals in plastic. In most countries around the world, companies are not required to reveal chemical additives to plastics, which include things like phthalates, BPA and flame retardants. Many of those plastics end up in low-income countries along with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/04/plastic-waste-burned-study/"&gt;mountains of plastic waste&lt;/a&gt; for recycling or disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="STVTM6ZTBVDDDLA7BI57GTS4P4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They are the receivers of all the plastic garbage,” Woodruff said. “And the phthalates are going to be there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNRjRNZFlIaF9lTG1YcEhfNFdwV185NldQUHZTRlVCN2tSVFdSMGF0WEJldmUxSmg4Z0RlQVhQU0dCR3FZZ29HS0Q1eGV4VGVuLWQtQlVIa2ViaVVrYktQeENTaFZoVl9vZGhwZFBwUTBpSVFqRDAzTGN4R3QyTE1tNDVJYlB1MVZIcks2Sk1VSWE1amJyMG5DMU9adUh0aWRVMzg3bmxqczVxTVIteHRxV09B</guid></item><item><title>根据骨科医生的说法，如何在中年预防受伤并进行更智能的训练- MindBodyGreen | How To Prevent Injuries &amp; Train Smarter In Midlife, According To Orthopedic Surgeons - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNUzYzWXZiYlBNd00tUUdZUzRZNjFON3RuTlNnTGpJNGROZy1oVFFMQmx2OTVyM0VnMlFqS1hQWHh3OE5pMzhQbGhFU0JwOW9FYk5rSE5RWVNid1NYMUdCNXpFc2JLT01RYjVaOWIxQUM3OEZRcGdDTWo5V3hFWnNHUEdEc3lqOHBzeXVxdmI3UmliV3ZqY0t3dXVZN25mREpLS1hUTVpwbVMxcjlfaXUxZWNkcTBDTnNzM25FRjdoaWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent too long talking about fitness as a way to shrink ourselves.

We’re not about to tell you that one specific “superfood” will zap your chances of ever developing cancer, because that’s not true. But what you eat can be a powerful tool for supporting your overall health in ways that may impact your cancer risk, such as by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about what an oncologist eats for breakfast every day to bolster their defenses against cancer? We reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/tingting-tan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tingting Tan, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tingting Tan, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, medical oncologist and hematologist at City of Hope in Newport Beach, California.

Some research shows that higher fiber intake is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason might be that it supports a healthy gut microbiome, which can aid in cancer prevention,” Tan says. For example, a 2021 systematic review in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition &lt;/em&gt;identified a link between oat consumption and an increase in beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a half-cup of whole grain rolled oats contains about 5 grams of fiber, and our Creamy Blueberry-Pecan Oatmeal recipe contains 6 grams of fiber per serving.&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; That’s around 21% of the Daily Value for fiber.&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods with phytochemicals, which are compounds found in vegetables, fruit, beans and nuts, may slow cancer cell growth,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are rich in a type of phytochemical called anthocyanin, which helps give the fruit its deep blue color and may reduce inflammation and free radicals.&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Plus, research has shown that berries may be associated with a lower risk of cancer.&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Components in berries also have been shown to reduce the growth of precancerous cells,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; This makes these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antioxidant powerhouses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antioxidant powerhouses&lt;/a&gt; a go-to oatmeal topping, especially given that you can rinse a handful of berries and toss them on top of your oatmeal in less time than it would take to watch a TikTok video.

A 2018 randomized controlled trial, for example, found that walnuts may increase the amount of good bacteria in the gut microbiome.&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts are also anti-inflammatory, “and we know that inflammation is associated with developing cancer,” Tan says. Some research has found a strong connection between cancer and chronic inflammation.&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; To top it all off, nuts are rich in antioxidant-rich compounds like vitamin E, which may help protect the body from cell damage over time.&lt;strong&gt;15,16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Breakfast Options To Reduce Cancer Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for some more breakfast ideas that could reduce inflammation, improve gut health and support your overall health?

&lt;p&gt;By Linda Cicoira&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published last week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Entomology&lt;/em&gt; documents human cases of the tickborne disease, Babesiosis, the presence of the parasite that causes the disease in local tick populations, and a growing public health threat for the Mid-Atlantic Region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was submitted by a retired federal public health worker who lives on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Twenty-one of her colleagues joined her in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The findings underscore the need for increased surveillance, public awareness, and preventive measures against tick-borne diseases in the … region,” said Ellen Stromdahl, of Harborton. “Healthcare providers should consider babesiosis in the differential diagnosis for patients (having or showing symptoms of a fever) … particularly during peak tick activity seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;April is generally considered the start of tick season. However, local residents have been known to find ticks in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journal is a peer-reviewed publication dedicated to advancing research on insects, ticks, and other arthropods of medical and veterinary importance. It provides critical insights into vector-borne diseases, parasite ecology, and public health implications worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Let us get the word out about babesiosis so we can help save lives,” the lead author wrote in an email over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Babesiosis is a disease caused by parasites transmitted to one’s red blood cells. Symptoms can include flu-like illness, hemolytic anemia, and, in severe cases, complications like organ failure or death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tick-borne illnesses can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Some common examples include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis. Other less common but still significant tick-borne illnesses include babesiosis, tularemia, and Powassan virus disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that babesiosis, historically concentrated in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, is now expanding. The research highlights an increasing number of locally acquired human cases. Cases were reported in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. It was detected in ticks in those regions and Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;      Babesiosis can be severe in the elderly or immunocompromised, especially when patients have concurrent infections with the pathogenic spirochete responsible for Lyme disease. Diagnosis can be difficult, as the disease is rare. Babesiosis might be misdiagnosed or treated empirically with antibiotics typically prescribed for Lyme disease or anaplasmosis, such as doxycycline. However, antibiotics alone are not effective against babesiosis, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

On April 27, the Chihuahua Health Secretariat pushed the state’s number of confirmed cases even higher, to 713. In comparison, the Pan American Health Organization reported &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf"}' href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only 7 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; in the whole of Mexico in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outbreak in Chihuahua is partly due to its proximity to Texas, which it borders to the north. A major outbreak has been &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-rise-texas/"&gt;ongoing in the US state since late January&lt;/a&gt;, and cases in Mexico have been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561"&gt;linked to those north of the border&lt;/a&gt;. The United States has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;884&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases of measles this year, up from 285 in 2024, as well as three deaths from the disease. Of this year’s cases in the US, 646 have been in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To try to prevent the measles virus from spreading further throughout Mexico, its Ministry of Health has issued a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf"}' href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;travel warning&lt;/a&gt; for the United States and Canada, where cases have also risen sharply. The ministry advises travelers to make sure they are up-to-date with their vaccinations, practice social distancing, wear a mask, and frequently wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Falling vaccination levels have also helped drive up Mexico’s cases, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;as they have in the US&lt;/a&gt;. In 98 percent of US cases this year, the patient—whether an adult or child—had no history of vaccination against measles. In early April, it was reported that a 31-year-old man unvaccinated against measles had died of the disease in Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, very high rates of vaccination against it—95 percent—are needed across communities to stop the virus from spreading. But rates of vaccination in Mexico have been faltering. Children are supposed to receive two doses of the measles vaccine, the first typically between 12 and 15 months, and the second within the next few years. According to the WHO, in 2023 &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS?locations=MX"&gt;only 76 percent&lt;/a&gt; of children under 2 years old in Mexico had received a measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If rates don’t improve, this could allow the disease to become endemic again in North America. According to an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-measles-likely-to-become-endemic-in-us-polio-diphtheria-rubella/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Stanford University epidemiologists, at current state-level vaccination rates in the US, measles could reestablish itself and be steadily present in the country over the next two decades. This would result in the deaths of 2,500 people over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In response to the urgent need to reverse Mexico’s decreasing vaccination coverage, the Ministry of Health has launched a National Vaccination Week, the country’s first nationwide immunization campaign since the Covid-19 pandemic. From April 26 to May 3, the plan is to boost vaccine levels in the group most vulnerable to measles: children from 1 to 9 years of age. The ministry hopes to inoculate 1.8 million children to bring them up-to-date with their shots, by offering vaccines free of charge at hospitals, clinics, schools, and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles isn’t the only disease being targeted in Mexico: Children over 4 years old are also being offered the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) vaccine, and a pneumococcal booster is being offered at 12 months of age. Adolescents, adults over 60, and pregnant women are also being invited to get specific vaccines that they might need as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-how-measles-can-kill-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;viral disease&lt;/a&gt;, and it is considered to be one of the most contagious in the world. It mostly spreads among children. It is transmitted by contact with infected nasal or pharyngeal secretions and through the air, and it initially affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, abundant nasal discharges, and a skin rash that spreads all over the body. Complications can include blindness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), diarrhea, dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia. In severe cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/ante-brote-de-sarampion-en-mexico-emiten-alerta-de-viaje-a-ee-uu-y-lanzan-semana-nacional-de-vacunacion"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPemVWTmRVTDluMG9ZNXJ6Mkx0RlRnOFNob0kzTUpVUnZSSWwyd1NzVzl6QzhxZGVwZnBzb19vQU5WYUEzYlYzbDlfY2kydzh6M19PQzdJdmYzbEc4cU02UDYxTUVDLWxjQ1hwUnRuTnpiWGx6YXBpVUVmVHZVNU9uY1c3cmYyUGFqSnlj</guid></item><item><title>普拉提教练建议您在睡觉前进行这五步动作，以获得深度睡眠- Fit&amp;Well | A Pilates instructor says you should do this five-move routine before bed for deep sleep - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxNZ3NtRFRucjZzdmJVMVJCbFU2bFlHNTJLOTRmamVBMl9Na1BXOTl5TnFkMnhrUUFGM0gyc0xraVlBS1N1OTVfcGRCaDBYa3lWMlJJNUJrOTBTbWVKUGhCRzlJMmJSZlE1TFZReGZmTmc3NDZUUjl4TGh1UDV3MVJwNGJicmhBVmphUV9EakZBQ1J4cldHRlNNdS00R0k1VUQzOTVpVVpPTWNmd0llUlNLaU9JeE1CQVhSbGNFQ1FFbzVGN0lmWndaWE1Ha3E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Those adding a little bit of&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/cinnamon-products-lead-consumer-reports-b2614447.html"&gt; cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; to their sugar or hot beverage of choice aren't likely to have any issues, but consuming the spice in high doses could &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/health-and-wellbeing/gemma-collins-mounjaro-wegovy-ozempic-b2737810.html"&gt;cause complications&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications,” Shabana Khan, a principal scientist involved in the study, said. “Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, can activate receptors in the body that actually breaks down certain medicines, researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted in the study that cinnamon oil — typically used in cooking and for toiletries — poses no risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not the same for cinnamon bark. The study found that bark, especially that of Cassia cinnamon, a cheaper Chinese version of the spice, have the potential to cause medicine-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 kSitga"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12009"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True cinnamon from Sri Lanka carries a lower risk due to its reduced coumarin content,” the study's co-author Amar Chittiboyina, associate director of the National Center for Natural Products Research, said. “Coumarin’s anticoagulant properties can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon typically carried in grocery stores is generally made of Cassia cinnamon bark, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/27/health/popular-spice-could-interfere-with-prescription-drugs-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone consumes a significant amount of cinnamon regularly or has concerns about their cinnamon intake, they should speak to their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan said that anyone relying on medications to stay healthy should check with their doctors before taking supplements that could interact negatively with their treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who suffer from chronic diseases — like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression — should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements," Khan said. “Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine.

    &lt;p&gt;Champagne and white wine “protect” the heart from cardiac arrest, new research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts found that drinking wine, eating more fruit and keeping slim were all linked to a lower risk of a sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 Britons each year suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (which is different from a heart attack). This occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating, and emergency resuscitation is required to start it again. Researchers said thousands of people could prevent it by tackling health and lifestyle issues, as they identified 56 risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an “intriguing” finding of the research was that champagne and white wine seemed to produce a “protective effect” on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Fudan University in Shanghai, China, found that a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-white-wine-healthier-than-we-think/"&gt;higher consumption of white wine&lt;/a&gt;, more fruit, a consistent positive mood, maintaining a healthy weight and keeping blood pressure under control all seemed to protect against a cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more educated also seemed less prone to cardiac arrest, the study, published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, suggested. Poor sleep patterns and a lack of exercise could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;No ‘fed-up feelings’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified 56 risk factors associated with sudden cardiac arrest and found up to 63 per cent of cases might be avoidable if people changed unhealthy habits. It looked at 502,094 middle-aged to older people included in the UK Biobank’s data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these, 3,147 people suffered sudden cardiac arrest during an average follow-up period of 13.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that between 40 per cent and 63 per cent of sudden cardiac arrest cases may be avoidable when looking at all 56 risk factors, which included lifestyle factors, socio-economic status, and the local environment, such as exposure to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifestyle factors, researchers found that a higher consumption of champagne and/or white wine and fruit intake protected against cardiac arrest, while “fed-up” feelings, high body mass indexes (BMIs) and arm fat mass, high blood pressure, and lower education level all increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that the risk for regular champagne and white wine drinkers was about 30 per cent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Huihuan Luo, the lead investigator from Fudan University, said: “The study found significant associations between various modifiable factors and sudden cardiac arrest, with lifestyle changes being the most impactful in preventing cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘More complex than previously assumed’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial, Nicholas Grubic, from the University of Toronto, and Dakota Gustafson, from Queen’s University in Ontario, said: “One of the study’s most intriguing findings is the cardioprotective effect associated with champagne and white wine consumption, questioning long-held assumptions about the specificity of red wine’s cardioprotective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on the underlying mechanisms remains unclear, but these findings reinforce the idea that the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may be more complex than previously assumed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that the polyphenols found in wine, which have typically been associated with red wine, can play a role in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-red-wine-good-for-you"&gt;lowering blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and reducing the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These antioxidants can be found in all types of wine but are lower in white varieties. Despite this, the research suggests they may help to protect the body’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the antioxidants found in alcoholic drinks can help to protect the heart and other body cells as well as the brain, with some researchers suggesting it can ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research, which found a link rather than cause, has not taken into account the other potential harms that alcohol can cause or whether there is a net benefit to having a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, doctors rely on brain scans called PET scans to find amyloid plaques or do a spinal tap to check for abnormal levels of proteins like beta-amyloid and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These tests are expensive, invasive and not always easy to access. Blood tests could make it much simpler to find early signs of the disease and be more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you get a diagnosis early, you're actually able to access treatments that you cannot take later on in the disease process," &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a clinical psychologist and Alzheimer's Association spokesperson, said in an interview with ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report highlights that diagnosing Alzheimer's earlier could open the door to treatments when they have the best chance of working, helping people stay mentally sharper for longer and giving families more time to plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the past two years, the FDA has approved two new drugs -- Leqembi and Kisunla -- that can slow the progression of early Alzheimer's. While they are not cures, they can help people preserve memory and thinking skills longer, offering more time with a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This marks a major shift from older Alzheimer's treatments, which could only manage symptoms without slowing down the disease much. However, these new drugs carry significant challenges, including high costs, the need for frequent brain scans to monitor serious side effects and the risk of swelling or bleeding in the brain. In addition, only people in the early stages of Alzheimer's are eligible to receive these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ultimately, we would love to see an array of treatments that are available that tackle different aspects of Alzheimer's, different factors that are contributing to it," Edgerly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She noted that more than 140 different treatments are now in development, aiming to target different symptoms and stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also lays out an updated understanding of Alzheimer's risk factors, dividing them into two categories. Some risks -- like age, genetics and family history -- cannot be changed. Others -- including diet, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, hearing and vision health -- are within a person's control. Addressing the modifiable risks can have a significant impact on a person's Alzheimer's risk, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In fact, Edgerly said that nearly half of all dementias could be preventable by taking better care of modifiable risks earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A nurse holds the hands of a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease on September 21, 2009 at Les Fontaines retirement home in Lutterbach , eastern France.

My last A1C test showed a value of 7.8%. I have been taking Mounjaro weekly, which lowered my weight by about 20 pounds and my A1C level by about 0.5%. I also take diltiazem for hypertension, a statin, and one metformin pill per day. I read an article in the newspaper stating that according to experts, an A1C of over 7% may be appropriate for "older people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My question is, what is the definition of "older people"? Is it over 65 or even older? I am wondering if I still need to be overly concerned about my A1C reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.:&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are no clear studies to inform us of the ideal blood sugar control (the A1C is a measurement of your overall blood sugar during the past few months), expert groups try to balance the potential benefits of keeping sugar levels near normal (with its reduced risk of small blood vessel disease that can lead to kidney and nerve damage over time) against the potential harms from very tight blood sugar control (with its risk of dangerously low blood sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately, the term "older people" doesn't really help here. The critical issue is whether a person is in sufficiently good health to realize the benefits of good blood pressure control. An otherwise healthy 71-year-old absolutely has a life expectancy that makes blood sugar control important, which means an A1C level of 7.0% to 7.5% might be ideal. For older people with multiple medical issues, an A1C of 8% might be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Studies like the ACCORD trial, which showed that a very low A1C goal of 6% led to worse outcomes than an A1C goal of 7% in people at a high risk for heart disease, were done at a time when the medicines we had were not always good for the heart. The Mounjaro you are taking reduces the risk of heart disease, and future studies may show that this class of medicines, along with others like the SGLT2 inhibitors, may completely change our understanding of blood glucose control and heart disease. It may be that in the future, "tighter" control of blood sugar may lead to better long-term outcomes, but it will take large trials to help sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have had a sore tongue for a month. I visited a doctor and got some ointment and mouthwash, but it hasn't cured it. What other steps should I take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— G.W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear G.W.:&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven't already, your first visit should be to a dentist who can do a comprehensive exam to look for other causes of tongue and mouth pain. Aphthous ulcers ("canker sores"), herpes virus ("cold sores"), dry mouth, allergic reactions and nutritional deficiencies are all possibilities. There are dermatologic diseases like a geographic tongue that can cause mouth or tongue pain. Fungal infections may also be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nerve diseases such as glossopharyngeal neuralgia and burning mouth syndrome could also cause symptoms. If your dentist and general physician haven't been able to help, a visit with a neurologist may be of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have had several patients become sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is an ingredient in many toothpastes. Occasionally, simply switching to an SLS-free toothpaste solves the problem. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNZWkwYVVGWGVGWU1fcS03aE43ZzhlMXJyeHJ0OVlsZG5vY2FmaDVMbjBnQ1BWVHA4ZlV3eTFzajBkRjJlbkp4cHVyekNOM00tQ1lNWnl4ZURVRHZXcTZ1clZrYXN1cGN3ZFVFRW8waHl1MU52N1ZwMGNhdDFkWGc0dzVtVHp4cF9nQlRzQ3Brb1VaM1RNemdXeDV4VWYtWVlQM0U2Sm5DOWltUDJfTldjWnVnTFVabVBCcksxNllIZWhrZWdmM3pnVXprNG5VdXc</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，家用塑料制品中的化学物质与心脏病死亡有关- CNN | Chemicals in household plastic products linked to heart disease deaths, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPYjV0UUo3c19QZFNsTmxPTVowbTZaNFZPTDJ3RlVzR3JXUkEwMDM0QVUyQlBiNnVlSXJTcGZLa21EdHdxekVNWnBoblNrOHlrZ1B0VHExWXo0VmtTSmkwYTlLUF9GMThRU2ZkRWVTUjhKeWxwMFJUd3BIUEl5TXpGN3RhSzhSaGRndFHSAYABQVVfeXFMT0pyYXhNNVdLeTM0em5KQkM1RUZkc0VMeU5sSWlXOGFPRzktdHd2eHYxSnJzc3prcDA0NjhoMld5dHBGNTlDN0Jpdmo4Q0FlSDJqZTBqQ1I4akFSSmxaZ19yTGJ4VUFoakZFMmxHbzVpWXhaQjczT204WHJ2VEZXSGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000f3b6mautkc2qb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000k3b6myh1jt81h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eBiomedicine, examined the impact of one phthalate — &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate&lt;/a&gt;, or DEHP — on global deaths across 200 countries and territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000n3b6m610vnucu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000o3b6mqoh2ib40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 368,764 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000v3b6mxpdd7sf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00103b6m15pm0pdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00113b6mev2owgaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are other tips to reduce exposure:

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The mass was likely hidden among dense breast tissue, since both appear white on the scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I asked to see her mammograms, and actually, her mammograms for the last five years read that she had extremely dense breasts, and she was never notified," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=437&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=874&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21." data-c-credit="Robin Buckson, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/leo/bureaus-agencies/miosha/divisions/technical-services-division/rad-safety/mammography/breast-density-patient-notification-requirement" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Michigan law has required&lt;/a&gt; facilities to inform patients about breast density in a letter since 2015, the Food and Drug Administration updated its policies and made this the national standard last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet, insurers in Michigan vary as far as who covers additional screenings for women with dense breast tissue. Blue Cross Blue Shield, Michigan's largest insurer with over 5 million members across all 50 states, covers 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, as well as additional imaging for tactile abnormalities or abnormal mammograms, but is now reviewing its policies after the National Comprehensive Cancer Network released new guidance for patients with extremely dense breasts earlier this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This guidance recommends patients with normal results from a mammogram receive a screening breast MRI with and without contrast beginning at age 50," Blue Cross Blue Shield said in a statement. "This new guidance is currently being reviewed by our medical policy team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan Medicaid, which provides coverage to low-income residents, also only covers mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Thirty-six states have insurance laws on the books for coverage of 3D or supplemental screenings for breast cancer based on risk factors like breast density, according to &lt;a href="https://densebreast-info.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DBI-INSURANCE-TABLE032625.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dense Breast Info&lt;/a&gt;, an educational nonprofit based in New York, but Michigan is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates say uneven coverage is a barrier for women with dense breasts, and many can't afford to pay out of pocket for additional screenings beyond a mammogram. There's also a lack of education about dense breast tissues among some patients, which is another obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The more information a patient has, the more they can advocate for themselves and make clear, informed decisions when it comes to health care," said Gretchen Awad, executive director of the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization in northwest Ohio and Michigan. "But the letter of information about breast density is only really one step. The next step would be ... the equal and equitable mammogram policies in each state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians read mammograms, breast density falls within four categories: almost entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular elements, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense, said Dr. Sabala Mandava, Chair of Radiology at Henry Ford Health. Heterogeneously dense tissue refers to tissue that is mostly dense but also has some areas of fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians talk about dense breast tissue, they are typically referring to the latter two categories, heterogeneously dense and extremely dense, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have dense breast tissue ... it's one of the risk factors for breast cancer, so you will have an increased risk," Mandava said. "Because the tissue is dense, it's harder to see through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On a mammogram, dense tissue appears white and fat appears black, Mandava said. The issue is that cancers also appear white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have more dense breast tissue, then it's harder to differentiate between a cancer and the tissue," Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=660&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=1320&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="These are side-by-side breast scans from a 69-year-old female patient with no symptoms and dense breasts.

Breast density refers to the amount of fibroglandular tissue, or the fibrous connective tissue and milk ducts and lobules, found in the breast, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/fibroglandular-breast-tissue" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When you look at women who have the fatty tissue ... the pickup rate for cancer in those women is about 90%, but when you look at the women with dense tissue, the ability to find the cancer goes down to about 50%," said Dr. Murray Rebner, a Corewell Health diagnostic radiologist. "So that's a big difference, and that's why we recommend doing the extra testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The federal Mammography Quality Standards Act was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa-and-mqsa-program/important-information-final-rule-amend-mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;amended by the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new standards, all facilities must send patients a letter classifying their breast density after administering a mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If a patient's tissue is classified as dense, they must be informed that it can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, make it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram, and that other imaging may help find cancer. The letter must also encourage the patient to talk to their provider, according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with dense breasts should undergo extra screening, in addition to a mammogram, Rebner said. Doctors like to tailor imaging for patients based on their overall lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, which is based on several factors, including tissue density and genetic predisposition, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Supplemental screening can range from ultrasounds to molecular breast imaging with radioactive dye, and MRIs, Rebner said. Some techniques, like contrast-enhanced mammography, are still under investigation but may prove to be almost as good as MRIs at finding breast cancers, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"For high-risk women, women who, let's say, have a greater than 20% lifetime risk of getting breast cancer, those patients we typically recommend doing MRIs on," Rebner said. "MRI is really, right now, the best test at finding the most number of cancers for women who need an additional screening test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Often, physicians will recommend that patients undergo a breast cancer risk assessment if they have dense breast tissue, Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That will basically show if you are at high risk, and if you are, then there are supplemental tools," Mandava said. "You can get an MRI, you can do a whole breast ultrasound. There's a new modality coming out, or it has come out, but it's still new, called contrast-enhanced mammography."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Screening is currently the best tool available to fight breast cancer, Rebner said. Finding cancers earlier also allows physicians to treat them more efficiently, potentially avoiding chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or extensive surgeries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The purpose of screening is to find breast cancer at its earliest point of development," Rebner said. "By finding cancers earlier on ... if you do that, you reduce mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Additional screenings, out of pocket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan is one of 14 states that have no insurance law for coverage of 3D or supplemental screening for breast cancer, according to Dense Breast Info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates such as Awad applaud the recent FDA mammography notification changes but say it's only the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awad, who lives in Ohio, said she was informed that she has dense breast tissue, and she pays an additional out-of-pocket fee for a more advanced mammogram. Not everyone is able to access additional screening methods, can afford out-of-pocket costs if their insurance doesn't cover it, or is aware of what their screening options beyond regular mammograms are, she said. Coverage varies by both state and insurance provider, Awad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's very important to not forget that everyone's accessibility to health care is different," Awad said. "While I might live or you might live in an area with high-quality and highly trained technicians ... not everyone does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Coverage varies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Michigan, coverage varies for additional screenings, which can range from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket for a breast MRI to $250 to $400 for a breast ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Priority Health said they cover 3D mammography as a preventive measure, and have done so since Michigan's Breast Density Notification law passed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"MRIs or whole-breast ultrasounds are used as part of diagnostic measures and may include member cost sharing," Priority Health said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which covers digital breast 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, said its medical policies are also reviewed annually, or when significant evidence is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan's Medicaid program, for low-income residents and some with disabilities, covers mammograms for screening purposes in accordance with guidelines from the American Cancer Society and United States Preventive Services Task Force, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin said. But she said there "is not enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy," the &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/breast-cancer-screening#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions,of%20dying%20from%20this%20disease." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;task force's recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last April, said. "... We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sutfin also said that Michigan Medicaid has a process to support coverage of diagnostic mammograms at different intervals, ages, or frequencies when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Aetna said its coverage of supplemental breast imaging for both medical and preventive care complies with federal and state regulations, as well as plan-specific benefits, spokesman Phillip Brando wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health Alliance Plan and Meridian did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A nonprofit is born&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hallowell, moved to act by her sister's diagnosis, founded a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.operationbreastdensity.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Operation Breast Density&lt;/a&gt; to educate people about what breast density is, how people can determine their breast density, and how to talk to their physician about it. The nonprofit also hosts an annual symposium to educate clinicians and raise funds to help people pay for supplemental imaging when their insurance doesn't cover it, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Seeing someone that knew how to advocate for ... themselves and knew what should be done, and still they weren't given correct service, I decided to start the nonprofit to educate women," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with a diagnosis of breast density from a mammogram within the last two years, and a prescription for supplemental imaging from their physician, can reach out to the nonprofit for financial assistance, Hallowell said.

He also referred to a &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199801083380204"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who walked more than two miles (3.22km) a day had only half the death rate of those who were less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg even said in an &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/101-year-old-nutrition-professor-rules-for-long-life-rcna199726"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with TODAY that he believes his highly active lifestyle was the reason he 'outlived' his two brothers by decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The main difference was I got a tremendous amount of exercise,' he theorised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #4 - No snacking and eat by the clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the core of Dr Scharffenberg's rules is that what you eat makes a difference – and that means ensuring you maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutrition professor recommends implementing simple guidelines around eating habits to ensure you don't gain unnecessary weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat at the proper time.

The expert explained that his final meal of the day is in the early afternoon and that he doesn't consume any food again until 6.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #5 - Consider ditching this food for good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Dr Scharffenberg has adhered to a vegetarian diet since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The centenarian said that although he did later try meat, he hasn't eaten it since he was 20 years old. Instead, he follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg's favourite foods include mangoes, persimmons, potatoes, macadamias and other nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says a vegetarian diet is 'optimum' because eating too much meat can &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;increase the risk &lt;/a&gt;of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #6 - Get saturated fat intake down by cutting meat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This rule ties back into Dr Scharffenberg's edict about the benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet, because loads of saturated fats come from meat like beef, pork and poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accordingly, Dr Scharffenberg says adhering to a vegetarian diet and getting rid of animal fat intake is the simplest way to avoid the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; associated with high saturated fat intake, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #7 - Say 'no' to your sweet tooth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg points to a clear link between sugar consumption and the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease as well as other weight gain related health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends modifying recipes to reduce sugar intake.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say proper hydration is critical for healthy blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with diabetes may be prone to dehydration, so fluids are especially important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sugar fruits, veggies and Greek yogurt are fluid-rich and diabetes-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and managing blood sugar are two essential pillars of overall health. And they’re particularly important if you’re living with type 2 diabetes—for several reasons. The first is that high blood sugar levels may lead to increased urination, which may cause dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Proper hydration is also crucial for supporting kidney function. Since the kidneys play a vital role in filtering excess sugar from the blood, dehydration can put additional strain on these organs if you have diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that there are certain water-rich foods that can be a delicious part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7886108/diabetes-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly diet&lt;/a&gt; and provide the fluids you need. To find out which ones are best, we reached out to registered dietitians. Here are their top hydrating foods for healthy blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-cucumbers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Cucumbers &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Sliced Cucumbers = 3.3 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Boasting roughly 95% water, cucumbers can help keep you refreshed and hydrated without having to rely on sugary or caloric drinks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  With just 4 grams of carbohydrates per cup, they’re also a blood sugar–friendly food. Their skin also provides a bit of fiber, which can prevent rapid glucose spikes, says Orlando-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you like adding them to salads, blending them into a refreshing smoothie or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252056/creamy-cucumber-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt;, or you simply enjoy them sliced as a crunchy snack, cucumbers are an easy, nutrient-rich way to bump up your fluids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-okra"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Okra  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Cooked Okra = 5 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Okra might not be on your radar, but it should be! Not only is okra 93% water, it provides 4 grams of blood sugar–stabilizing fiber per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Okra contains a gel-like soluble fiber, which slows down sugar absorption,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anosiri/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Adaure Nosiri, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an Atlanta-based registered dietitian. “Okra also contains antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which play a role in reducing inflammation and improving glucose metabolism.” One cooked cup of this veggie contains 7 grams of carbs, making it easy to fit into a balanced meal plan. Plus, it supplies &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a mineral that plays a pivotal role in blood sugar regulation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try it roasted, steamed or in soups for a versatile, hydrating addition to your diet. If you’ve never made okra before, give our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252686/black-eyed-peas-okra/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Black Eyed Peas &amp;amp; Okra&lt;/a&gt; a go. This diabetes-friendly side packs 7 grams of fiber per serving plus 11% of the Daily Value for magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-apples"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Apples  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Medium Apple = 5.2 Ounces H20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Apples are made up of about 85% water and are high in fiber, with about 4 grams in a medium apple,” says &lt;a href="https://www.healthprofs.com/us/nutritionists-dietitians/stephanie-deming-churchville-ny/1390520" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephanie Deming, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Bespoke Family Nutrition, PLLC.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re worried about their sugar, there’s no need to be. Apples’ rich fiber slows the absorption of their sugars for a steady, prolonged energy release. Just make sure to eat the skins. They contain special fibers like pectin and cellulose that may help manage blood sugar.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples are so beneficial that one small study found that people with impaired blood sugar control who ate an apple before a high-carb meal experienced fewer blood sugar spikes than when they ate only simple carbs from rice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, bite into a crunchy apple when you need a satisfying snack (pair it with nut butter to add some healthy fats and protein for satiety support!). Or, for a hearty dinner, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252584/apple-cider-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apple Cider Chicken&lt;/a&gt;. It’s diabetes-friendly and takes just 30 minutes to prepare!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-grapefruit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Grapefruit  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;½  Grapefruit = 3.6 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This juicy citrus fruit is composed of 90% water, making it an excellent way to quench your thirst while adding a burst of refreshing flavor to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Not only do grapefruits have a high water content, but they also provide your body with an important electrolyte, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with overall fluid balance,” says &lt;a href="http://www.wellnourishedmamas.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jamie Adams, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in women’s health. Additionally, grapefruit’s fiber slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, promoting steadier energy levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed as a snack, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8023984/grapefruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in a zesty salad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269497/pineapple-grapefruit-detox-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added to a smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, this fruit is a delicious, nutritious addition to any diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Watermelon  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Diced Watermelon = 4.6 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As its name suggests, watermelon is an incredibly hydrating food (it’s 91% water!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it an ideal choice for staying hydrated on hot days while enjoying a naturally sweet treat. And despite what you might have heard, it has only 9 grams of sugar per cup. So, it can easily fit into a blood sugar management plan. Plus, watermelon contains citrulline, an amino acid that supports the production of nitric oxide, a compound that promotes better blood flow. While more research is needed, emerging research suggests citrulline may also improve insulin resistance and help manage blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, watermelon is juicy and refreshing on its own. For even more blood sugar–lowering power, pair it with a small serving of nuts or cheese to balance its carbohydrates. Or try our low-carb &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/272847/watermelon-cucumber-feta-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-plain-greek-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Plain Greek Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 (5.6-Ounce) Container Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt = 4.4 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Plain unsweetened Greek yogurt is a high-moisture food, and not only offers a quality source of protein, but is also low in carbohydrate and sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://www.milkandhoneynutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Ellen Phipps, M.P.H., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;The Easy Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “That makes it a perfect combination for people who have to pay attention to their blood sugars.” While a single-serve container of plain Greek yogurt only has about 6 grams of carbohydrates, flavored yogurt can have lots of added sugars. If plain yogurt isn’t your thing, look for no-sugar-added varieties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Greek yogurt is roughly 80% water. That’s not all, though. A 5.6-ounce container provides about 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s an added bonus, as protein slows digestion for steady blood sugar levels. Because protein also helps keep you full, it can help with weight loss if that’s part of your diabetes management plan. And if you need one more reason to toss a container in your shopping cart, Greek yogurt offers probiotics, promoting gut health, which is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gut-health-and-diabetes-8584301" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increasingly linked to better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a refreshing, hydrating snack, top plain Greek yogurt with a handful of fresh berries or a sprinkle of cinnamon. You can also try your hand at our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252990/homemade-plain-greek-yogurt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; DIY homemade Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; if you enjoy making things from scratch!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and keeping your blood sugar steady are two key steps to feeling your best, especially if you’re living with type 2 diabetes. The good news? You can tackle both at once by adding delicious, nutrient-packed, hydrating foods to your meals.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — As the weather warms and people start cleaning, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a warning about hantavirus — a disease passed through droppings, urine and saliva of mice or other rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stirring up dust where rodents have been can cause hantavirus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in," the department said Monday in a prepared release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It urges Utahns to be cautious when cleaning out sheds, cabins or other buildings that have had rodents present. The health department said hantavirus is rare; there are typically one or two reported cases in Utah each year, but it is fatal in about 60% of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of hantavirus include fatigue, fever and muscle aches and can include headaches, dizziness, chills or stomach issues. A second phase of the disease brings coughing and shortness of breath due to liquid in the lungs, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kacy Nowak, an epidemiologist with the health department, said anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry the virus is at risk for contracting hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make sure you take precautions when you work in areas with potential rodent droppings and nests. Use a disinfectant spray on areas with droppings and wait 15-20 minutes before you clean. This will kill the virus and decrease your risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; people can take to prevent contracting hantavirus include airing out closed buildings before going in, not sweeping droppings up, trapping mice, keeping pet food covered to not attract mice, sealing holes in homes and removing piles of trash, wood or junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cleaning up after rodents, the health department encouraged wearing rubber or plastic gloves and washing hands afterwards; soaking urine, droppings and nests with bleach or disinfectant before cleaning; throwing away towels used to clean up in a covered can; and cleaning the area with a disinfectant again after removing the nest or droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico authorities say actor Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at their Santa Fe home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn't yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Associated Press story published Monday said the leading cause of Hackman's death was heart disease. He was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — As health officials begin &lt;a href="/article/news/health/austin-measles-exposure-warning-contact-tracing/269-1142c886-b99c-47e6-8adf-973a14542a0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;contact tracing a second measles case in Travis County&lt;/a&gt;, some businesses are taking extra precautions to deal with the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Public Health identified nine locations across Austin where the infected person visited, including the South Austin Mexican restaurant, Curra's, which has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Julieta Rodriguez, the owner of Curra's, said she learned about the exposure at her establishment through news reports and had not heard from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My first thought was, it’s going to kill business,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Rodriguez said she hired a cleaning company to disinfect the restaurant over the weekend and has spoken to customers and staff since the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every day we clean," Rodriguez said. "We follow protocol with health codes, so that's pretty much what we can do as far as right now."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez added that she and her staff are vaccinated and have not felt any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can tell my customers is not to feel worried," Rodriguez said. “We're doing what we’re supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials stressed there is still a risk of exposure despite the person who was infected being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that a person who has been vaccinated is going to have less viral load,” said Dr. Desmar Walkes, the medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. "While the patient did catch the virus, they only have mild symptoms and are able to rest at home."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes also shared what health officials are doing in terms of outreach after Rodriguez said she wasn't aware of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been calling those businesses, and we'll continue to do so to work with them to provide the information they need,” Walkes said. "It may have been that they hadn't received that call as of yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes, along with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, reiterated the importance of getting the MMR vaccine as they ensure it is the best protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The key message today is that while we've had this second case of measles ... the best defense is vaccination,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for people who are unsure of their immunity status against the virus, they can speak with their health provider and take a test. For many who may be wondering whether they need a booster, Walkes said the two required doses should be sufficient unless one’s immune system is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

The above image shows hazmat-suited workers at a quarantine zone after an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fellow GVN director and expert on animal viruses, Dr Ab Osterhaus, says that a potential vaccine could also help to solve the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden Administration awarded Moderna a $590 million contract to develop a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu vaccine but there were reports earlier this year that the new administration could pull that funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response (OPPR), created after COVID-19 to coordinate rapid responses to outbreaks, has been left virtually unstaffed and unfunded since the Trump Administration came in, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pandemic planning has also been moved inside the National Security Council, which critics fear limits transparency and public oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first US &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-df4a7cb0-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; death was reported in January, with a person in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-df550400-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; passing away after being hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No other details were revealed. They also said a genetic analysis of the patient's infection suggested the bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-df4c9f90-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; virus had mutated while inside their body, which could have caused a more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2024, 70 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US, but most illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers directly exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In two cases - an adult in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-df555220-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and a child in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-df53cb80-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - health officials have not determined how they contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many experts put H5N1 at the top of their lists of pandemic threats, due to how widespread it is among animals and how rapidly it appears to be mutating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-81777ee0-246e-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a" class=""&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, recently said on X: 'This virus might not go pandemic, but it is really trying hard, and it sure is getting a lot of opportunities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts are warning that the US could be on the brink of another pandemic, with bird flu now present in all 50 states and millions of poultry culled every week as a result&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The GVN is now calling on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by improving surveillance and implementing biosecurity measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, figures show since the virus was detected in the US in January 2022, more than 12,875 wild and domestic flocks have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After&lt;span&gt; the virus spread to cows this year, it was diagnosed in 1,031 herds across 17 states - with the majority in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-d808d6d0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-d80924f0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And 70 cases have now been detected in humans across 14 states this year, the most cases reported in the US in at least two decades. Before the current outbreak, the last human case of bird flu was in 1997.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no evidence any of the patients spread the disease to other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the virus has been detected in unpasteurized or 'raw' milks, leading the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to announce that all companies handling raw milk will be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14166987/trendy-milk-tested-bird-flu-threat.html"&gt;required to share samples&lt;/a&gt; for testing upon request. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many experts, including officials at the World Health Organization, have criticized the US' response to the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have described it as a pandemic 'unfolding in slow motion.' Until the end of 2024, nearly all testing of cattle and of people exposed to infected cows were voluntary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now, mandatory testing is limited only to cattle moving between state lines.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases have also been sporadically recorded in pigs, which has concerned researchers because these animals can catch both human and bird strains of flu - and could be 'mixing vessels' for a new strain of bird flu virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some people lose part or all of their esophagus or stomach, making it hard or impossible to eat normally. Others may need a bag to collect stool or lose the ability to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All 49 patients with early-stage rectal cancer who received six months of immunotherapy were able to avoid surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"And it's after six months of treatment, their tumors were completely gone," said another one of the study's authors, Dr. Andrea Cercek, head of the Colorectal Section at MSK. "They didn't need any other treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two years later, 92% remained cancer-free. Among the first group to reach the five-year mark, all four patients were still disease-free — and two of them had gone on to have two children each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The amazing thing is they would not have been able to conceive or carry children had they gone through standard therapy," Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for patients with other early-stage cancers, 35 of 54 were cancer-free after undergoing immunotherapy and were able to avoid surgery. However, two patients still chose to proceed with surgery — one for peace of mind and the other to remove medical hardware related to the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the five patients whose cancers came back, most were successfully treated again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cercek explained that, while immunotherapy alone may not yet help most cancer patients avoid surgery, their work opens the door for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Just close your eyes and just imagine that one day you're diagnosed with cancer and you don't have your esophagus or your stomach or your rectum or your bladder, and you can avoid that," Diaz said. "For these 3% we can completely eliminate the need for surgery. It's quite transformational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;By combining different approaches with this type of immunotherapy, Cercek hoped they can replicate their success in more types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, we are continuing this trial and we are working on expanding the study outside of Memorial with more patients so that we can offer this therapy as a standard of care," Cercek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Luis Gasca -- an internal medicine resident at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Michigan, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit -- contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 23:07:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPRVM1Wl81VHQxTFh3ZXV6RTgySFgzeVZXX3JmNWY5eUJGVnIwOVlDZndReVlraTF5V1BhcnExVkFWek51OFppdXpZLS1aRGttNi1HMktFT0d2cF9haTlUeVVvczdLZFp0S0lBbnhVQklHWWtOVXNqV1RxeF81bDRFQ25zRXA5b21aWGxyUFctVWlhakNUY0dIcE5nWm9ycTZzUXd6SkxWQ0FORm5zVzNz0gG0AUFVX3lxTE5YdnJhU0J1dWtVZGpDQWo0ZGVIRy1TbmJaTUgzd0hFYVZvR3B6WXVIV1pQYkFleDBJNU15c1lRRm16M0VYNXJRd0wzbEVUS2hUUlFlMWw4TXVZQUhoaUVpdXJSREN3eUFDNjdReGdXaHA4R1FTUGtGWXZmLVdXOXlhazFSbEFneHZaTFlmWklDai1qaTlJcGxKenZwUTFRRTVFbENTVmhtbXVEd3lqYUdvcjZ5SQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么男同性恋者更容易患上ED ？他们能做些什么？ - Queerty | Why are gay men more likely to experience ED &amp; what can they do about it? - Queerty</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPeEdxSUxrVlZDcXlvYTItYkRGWTdKT3Q1UUhNSThTTzRDREhSbW80OFpoZlg3ZTRTYWZUZDFDUnJ5OUVJWUNhUGZnZ1BZNUR6bDZHblBNZEJoeEY4M0VGcFNSUWk4ZF8wZk9MYTlyUGhDNlBMbV9XUGw3VlEyY1lHR2gzV2RuU3cwSkhnM1lwREI5QUVWWi1aODJvNUpzRWxXTFBoeGgtOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cf-column"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Press release from the Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association is sponsoring a county-wide low-cost
canine rabies vaccination clinic. The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association offers
these low-cost canine rabies clinics as a public service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that all dogs and cats be
vaccinated, as we have had several cases of rabies in wildlife and pets in Humboldt County as
recently as the last few months. Foxes, skunks, and bats are a few examples of rabies carriers.
We will be vaccinating dogs at the cost of $10.00 per rabies vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other canine and feline vaccinations will be available. The costs of these vaccines will vary with
the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact the animal hospital you would be interested in taking
your pet(s) to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinic Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, May 1, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.:&lt;/b&gt; Sunny Brae Animal Clinic
Saturday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, June 7, 8 a.m.-1 p.m.: &lt;/b&gt;Myrtle Ave Veterinary Clinic &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, July 17,  8 a.m.-noon:&lt;/b&gt; Arcata Animal Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional clinics are available in Trinity County. Please call for dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that extraverts are more likely to volunteer, while agreeable individuals are more inclined to donate money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other traits like conscientiousness, openness, and neuroticism showed little consistent effect on prosocial behavior. These findings could help organizations and policymakers create more personalized strategies to promote community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraversion and Volunteering:&lt;/strong&gt; Sociable and assertive individuals are more likely to volunteer their time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agreeableness and Giving:&lt;/strong&gt; Compassionate, considerate individuals are more likely to donate money to charity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People’s willingness to do volunteer work or give to charity differs greatly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides financial and social incentives, individual differences in people’s personality can explain why some of us are more likely to contribute to community welfare than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Department of Psychology of the University of Zurich have examined the links between the so-called Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) and people’s willingness to engage in prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis was based on 29 international studies comprising more than 90,000 participants. It included different methods to describe people’s personality and covered various forms of philanthropic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality traits matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings show that two personality traits in particular are linked to philanthropic engagement. Sociability and assertiveness (extraversion) positively correlate with volunteering. In other words, extraverts are more likely to do volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, agreeableness correlates more closely with a willingness to give money to charity. This behavior may be explained by the fact that agreeable people tend to be more compassionate and considerate of other people’s feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on the other personality traits, however, yielded mixed results. For example, there was no clear link between conscientiousness and philanthropic engagement. Openness and neuroticism also appeared to have little effect on people’s prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New strategies to promote volunteering and donating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings confirm that individual differences in personality play a role in whether and how much people engage in prosocial behavior,” says Wiebke Bleidorn, first author and professor of psychology at the University of Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes that a better understanding of these links can help to encourage people to contribute to the common welfare based on their individual strengths and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus not only provides valuable scientific insights but also practical guidance for organizations and policymakers wishing to promote volunteering and charitable giving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This knowledge can be used to develop more targeted strategies aimed at promoting volunteering and charitable giving,” says Christopher J. Hopwood, last author and professor of psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this personality and altruism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#630e060f020d0a064d0d1a05060f061123080c0e0e160d0a0802170a0c0d4d16190b4d000b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melanie Nyfeler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uzh.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Melanie Nyfeler – University of Zurich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4sjhg_v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personality Traits and Traditional Philanthropy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher J.

There was little evidence for systematic moderator effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe the theoretical implications of these results for future research, discuss practical applications, and highlight gaps in this body of literature.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:24:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9OMFRoaHRGQm1TRFo4bzdfX0dOSmtILXlrRWZDU2h5empBTUd3VkY1YzVidlo1Q3BkbUF6NHFDb3dJbC1IbEpuZFRsUmZadVQzd0VsRHJwOHpPRVJBQm9rUUlpSy1USHBDV0FJNHRUOWRqbmsxWHc</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种情况可能会使您的早发性痴呆风险提高24% - EatingWell | This Condition May Raise Your Early-Onset Dementia Risk by 24%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE9ycGtIMW5VREVTTkFnczUwNXNtZm9qQ1FRcXlXOTktMC1objdMLUNwb1h5VmpiTFVPLW9DZENmNXZWNy1xQklLODNoUlpXRloyS1FOdVlVWDFkLXpxR0ozX2VxN0ZUUl8zU0QzTTREbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several conditions, and it’s diagnosed in people who exhibit three of five conditions, including high waist circumference, low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The prevalence of metabolic syndrome tends to increase as we get older. One study cites the rate at nearly 20% for those 20 to 39 years old but nearly 50% of those aged 60 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Metabolic syndrome increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes—it also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increases your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we often think of dementia and metabolic syndrome as being diseases of “old age,” there is evidence that these conditions may be on the increase in younger people. This connection and prevalence is an area researchers in Korea wanted to hone in on and learn more about. The research team published their findings in the American Academy of Neurology’s journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The goal of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome in midlife (ages 40 to 60) and the incidence of young-onset dementia. Young-onset dementia, also called early-onset dementia, is dementia diagnosed before age 65. The researchers also examined which components of metabolic syndrome are most strongly associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew their data from the Korean National Insurance Service, a government-run health insurance system in South Korea that covers more than 99% of its population. The services include regular biennial health checkups that gather clinical and lifestyle data, income levels and medical diagnoses. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After initially extracting data for more than 4 million people, researchers ultimately included around 2 million participants between the ages of 40 and 60 for this study who had undergone a general health screening in 2009. Participants were followed for an average of eight years. Just over half of the participants were men.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of the participants, just over 25% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. This included having at least three of the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Elevated waist circumference: ≥90 cm in men, ≥80 cm in women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg; or use of medication for high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar levels: elevated fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or use of oral medication for high blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood triglycerides: ≥150 mg/dL or use of medication for high triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol: &amp;lt;40 mg/dL in men, &amp;lt;50 mg/dL in women; or use of medication for low HDL-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 60% of the metabolic syndrome group were participants in their 50s, and 40% in their 40s. Men made up over 62% of this group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers gathered demographic and lifestyle data that were adjusted for during statistical analyses. These included age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise and income level. In addition, they also gathered medical diagnoses of the participants that occurred during the study period, focusing on dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running several statistical analyses, results suggested that metabolic syndrome in people ages 40 to 60 was associated with a:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;24% higher risk of all-cause young-onset dementia—all-cause meaning all types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21% increased risk of vascular dementia—a type of dementia caused by damage to the brain’s blood vessels, thus reducing blood flow and oxygen to the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also broke findings down for men and women. They found that men with metabolic syndrome had a 15% higher risk of young-onset dementia, and women with metabolic syndrome had a 34% higher risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, being diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in the 40s increased the risk of young-onset dementia more than being diagnosed in the 50s. And while all the components (risk factors) of metabolic syndrome were associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, the risk progressively increased with the number of components present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers pointed out several limitations of their study. First, they cannot say whether their results extend to people outside of South Korea. They also did not include other variables that influence young-onset dementia risk, like the presence of certain genes, family history of YOD, history of traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and education level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that they also lacked detailed behavioral (i.e. mental health) and environmental data, which can also influence dementia risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is more than just forgetting someone’s name or where you put your keys. It interferes with one’s ability to think, remember, understand, communicate and reason.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, it diminishes physical abilities, too, as the brain forgets how to do simple activities that used to be second nature. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While influenced by genetics, the components of metabolic syndrome may be a result of lifestyle choices. And they’re the same lifestyle choices that also influence your risk of other diseases, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and dementia. And many of these diseases and conditions are linked. For example, type 2 diabetes has been &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/link-between-dementia-and-type-2-diabetes-11704056" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;associated with an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia. And healthy cholesterol levels reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;as well as dementia&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering how all of these conditions are intertwined, it makes sense that there might be a common denominator. Scientists believe one of them is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can have several causes, including chronic stress, poor sleep quality, poor diet quality, microbiome imbalances and lack of physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That means certain lifestyle changes can help on that front, too.With that said, nothing is perfect, and no one habit—or combination of habits—will guarantee you will be free of inflammation or disease.

HSV-1 is the kind that causes cold sores, while HSV-2 typically causes genital symptoms. There is no cure for either virus and both remain in the body, dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to carry this virus for life; there is no medication available to treat it,' the woman lamented. 'There is only medication to relieve the pain, but the symptoms are recurring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight years on, the amateur singer says she is still dealing with a range of uncomfortable symptoms associated with herpes, and the cold sores even &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt;made their way onto her cheeks earlier this year. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from Li.Lac, a tech company which makes a disinfecting device for microphones, warns that 'contaminated microphones can spread harmful bacteria or viruses, like the flu or other diseases'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'This is particularly concerning in settings where multiple people may be using the same microphone, such as in recording studios, theaters, and conference rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One woman claims that she got more than she bargained for after a trip to her local karaoke bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition, microphones can harbor allergens and irritants that can trigger respiratory issues for those who are sensitive.'&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;span&gt;HSV-1 - the virus which typically causes oral herpes - is quite fragile outside the body, and once saliva dries, the virus typically becomes inactive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest risk would be if you were to immediately use a mic that someone with an active cold sore had come into contact with and you have broken skin on your mouth that the virus could enter through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A report this year revealed that more than 846million adults worldwide are currently living with genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes is an exceedingly common and life-long sexually transmitted disease spread by two types of the herpes simplex virus (HSV).&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one typically manifests as cold sores, while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An international team of researchers sought to improve upon earlier methods to estimate the prevalence of both types of HSV worldwide in people under 50, starting with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-bdcdbc80-b748-11ef-a27d-27fa2c0d4e7e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s 2012 and 2016 estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers determined that the global prevalence of incurable genital herpes has been on the decline in recent years. Around 1 in 5 people under 50, or 846 million globally, are living with genital herpes, according to the latest estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both herpes simplex virus types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one, which can occur at a young age, typically causes oral herpes (manifested as cold sores), while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More broadly, the research team determined that two-thirds of the global population – around 3.8 billion people – were living with any form of the more common HSV-1 in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020 alone, there were 122 million new HSV-1 infections in people from birth to 49 years old, including 16.8 million new genital infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And among people 15 to 39 affected by sexually-transmitted HSV-2, researchers identified 26 million new infections in 2020, bringing the total number of people currently living with HSV-2 to 520 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 20million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9189567/One-five-Americans-STI-nearly-HALF-infections-people-age-24.html"&gt;test positive for sexually transmitted infections every year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 50 and 80 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5364293/Half-Americans-cold-sores-12-genital-herpes.html"&gt;get the occasional cold sore, while about 12 percent of Americans 14 to 49 years old have genital herpes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes causes painful blisters and open sores at times on the vagina, penis, labia, or testicles, but it can also be asymptomatic. Additionally, the herpes simplex family of viruses can lay dormant in the body without causing noticeable problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the virus infects a person, it may travel up to a cluster of sensory nerves in the brain and remain dormant there for months or even years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in times of stress, severe fatigue, or changes to the immune system, the virus can reactivate, multiply, and travel back to the skin through nerve fibers. These stressful times can result in new blisters in the same area as the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People diagnosed with genital herpes are treated with prescription antiviral medications to make outbreaks shorter and less painful, but there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:02:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQX1laRkpfR0dGUVEyZFRwSWpqZ2U2UzRnRmhKSzNvWW9UZ3VmLWFrME0zeVdVY3RIa1JkcC1TMEdUWmVnMFZ3YUJuY1o1WlBsclRLeWIwTkU5Qzl1UFAwTmx6ZkVnQWpySmZ6ZER3UWphSmw2QWQ4OUVBSXp4SF82TUJIQWdoZnpoYjBYWlVWSkhSQXlONU5ic0JvOHFOakh1RkpDWjFXbzd6dnREQW5VUHJ5Z0dHTC1ieXRVTzVtakZBRVXSAcgBQVVfeXFMUGNLQ04tRHQ4Wl85Z09ucXNfdkRnOWF4RnRvV1B0VGktdTM5QlhZbDhaS01iTkxCQXprZjZhOERad0YxQlpUcmdaSzJmSExnRjNpRzJ2Q2lwbzNCNklqdGtkOENXcXJ1R2hGSENVbXpLNGU2Z1J3dkwtVl9xVUR5dHFWUmpyeWlKakNvcTg2TWhOck94YTlNQWV6RHVRQ281SFh4aFVPNnJwTFJHZnZSTW0zQ09yWU5ZbmItbDBJX2NUUW9LRTQyaHE</guid></item><item><title>无创脑脊髓界面可能有助于受伤后恢复运动-神经科学新闻 | Noninvasive Brain-Spine Interface May Help Restore Movement After Injury - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a noninvasive brain-spine interface that detects movement intentions and cues spinal cord stimulation to aid rehabilitation. Using EEG caps, they trained a decoder to recognize when volunteers either moved or imagined moving their legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proof-of-concept study shows that imagined movement alone can reliably trigger spinal stimulation, opening new possibilities for restoring voluntary movement after spinal cord injury. Future efforts aim to create universal decoders to simplify clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Intention Decoded:&lt;/strong&gt; A noninvasive EEG decoder accurately predicts leg movement or imagined movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinal Stimulation Triggered:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain signals can cue spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; This approach may lead to noninvasive rehabilitation therapies for people with spinal cord injuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a person sustains an injury to the spinal cord, the normal communication between the brain and the spinal circuits below the injury are interrupted, resulting in paralysis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the brain is functioning normally, as is the spinal cord below the injury, researchers have been working to re-establish the communication to allow for rehabilitation and potentially restore movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ismael Seáñez, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis and of neurosurgery at WashU Medicine, and members of his lab, including Carolyn Atkinson, a doctoral student, have developed a type of decoder to restore that communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through experiments in their lab with 17 human subjects without a spinal cord injury, they were able to cue movement in the lower leg with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, or noninvasive, external electrical pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the research were published online April 25, 2025, in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a special cap fitted with noninvasive electrodes that measure brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While wearing the cap, seated volunteers were asked to extend their leg at the knee, then to only think about extending their leg – while keeping it still — so researchers could record the brain waves in both exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team provided the neural activity to the decoder, or algorithm, so it could learn how the brain waves act in both circumstances. They found that the actual movement and imagined movement used similar neural strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we give the decoder this data, it learns to predict based on neural activity whenever there is movement or no movement,” Seáñez said. “We show that we can predict whenever someone is thinking about moving their leg, even if their leg does not actually move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used controls to ensure that the volunteers were truly imagining movement and not actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whenever people move, this can introduce signal noise, and we want to make sure that the signal noise is not what we’re learning to predict,” Seáñez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s movement intention or brain activity that we want to predict, so we have people imagine that they’re extending their leg and use the same algorithm that has been trained on people moving to predict whether they were imagining or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said this reveals two things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One, that it’s more likely that we’re decoding movement intention and not an artifact, or noise, and second, whenever we employ this on people with spinal cord injury who will not have that ability to actually move their legs for us to label the data, we could use their imagination of moving a leg to train our decoder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said the proof-of-concept study is a first step toward developing a noninvasive brain-spine interface that uses real-time predictions to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement in a single joint in rehabilitation in patients with a spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the team plans to test a generalized decoder trained on data from all participants that could determine whether a universal decoder could perform as well as a personalized one and simplify its use in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this research was provided by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis; the National Institutes of Health (K12-HD073945, K01-NS127936; R01-EB026439; P41-EB018783); the Department of Biomedical Engineering in McKelvey Engineering at WashU; and the Department of Neurosurgery at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this SCI and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f29e819a9394949780b2858781869edc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-025-01628-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Carolyn Atkinson et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor rehabilitation is a therapeutic process to facilitate functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its efficacy is limited to areas with remaining sensorimotor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) creates a temporary prosthetic effect that may allow further rehabilitation-induced recovery in individuals without remaining sensorimotor function, thereby extending the therapeutic reach of motor rehabilitation to individuals with more severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report our first steps in developing a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify EEG-based neural correlates of lower limb movement in the sensorimotor cortex of unimpaired individuals (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 17) and to quantify the performance of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder in detecting movement onset from these neural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that initiation of knee extension was associated with event-related desynchronization in the central-medial cortical regions at frequency bands between 4 and 44 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our neural decoder using µ (8–12 Hz), low β (16–20 Hz), and high β (24–28 Hz) frequency bands achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 ± 0.06 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) during a cued movement task offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalization to imagery and uncued movement tasks served as positive controls to verify robustness against movement artifacts and cue-related confounds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the addition of real-time decoder-modulated tSCS, the neural decoder performed with an average AUC of 0.81 ± 0.05 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on cued movement and 0.68 ± 0.12 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on uncued movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decrease in decoder performance in uncued movement may be due to differences in underlying cortical strategies between conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we explore alternative applications of the BSI system by testing neural decoders trained on uncued movement and imagery tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By developing a non-invasive BSI, tSCS can be timed to be delivered only during voluntary effort, which may have implications for improving rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3</guid></item><item><title>欧洲和美洲的麻疹病例飙升- CIDRAP | Measles cases in Europe, the Americas skyrocket - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBOWVNJX3hCRTlzWHNuTlFnZWJidV9VcHgtOVBrUGxOZlpNWTBHbHNKR3dNLW81RExxQmpyU2tuS0l3X0ktWjdPMno1ekZLYmJ2TGxYRmw5NjJVTTgyLUFoYkRybEZlYU42eXhCcVVJMDJoTHllTmhPWVdBcWtwSUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases across Europe were up 10-fold in 2024 compared to 2023, while cases in the Americas so far this year are 11-fold higher, according to updates today from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/measles-annual-epidemiological-report-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moreover, the ECDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the 2024 measles cases in the European region followed a seasonal pattern, which was not noted in 2021 through 2023. In 2024, a total of 35,212 measles cases were reported across the European region, compared to 3,973 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports come as US states continue to confirm more infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romania has by far the most cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 87% of the European cases were reported in Romania, which had the highest notification rate, at 1,610.7 cases per 1,000,000 population, followed by Austria (59.5), Belgium (44.9) and Ireland (39.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three measles-related deaths were confirmed in 2024, of which 22 were in Romania, and 14 of the 23 were in children aged 5 years or younger. Children under the age of 1 year represented 13% of measles cases, and children 1 to 4 years represented 33.1% of cases. Among the 90% of case-patients with known vaccine status, 87% were unvaccinated, and 98% of infected babies (younger than 1 year) and 90% of children 1 and 4 years old with measles were unvaccinated.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECDC said dropping vaccine rates are contributing to the post-pandemic spike in measles activity across the county: In 2024, only three countries, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, had had coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases last year in the European region were reported in February through July, with a decline in the second half of the year. 'The marked resurgence in 2024 emphasizes a return to more typical measles seasonal patterns, but at significantly elevated levels compared to the pandemic and pre-pandemic years," the ECDC said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases climb 11-fold in Americas&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the WHO warned that, compared with late April of last year, measles cases have increased 11-fold in the Americas, with six countries reporting 2,318 measles cases, including 3 deaths—all in the United States—so far this year. From January 1 tto April 18, 2024, only 205 cases of measles were reported in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six countries reporting measles case this year are Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with the United States reporting the largest outbreak, at 900 cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges," &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. "Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More travel-related US cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In US developments, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/second-measles-case-reported-in-travis-county?e=b0a255979d"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Austin, Texas, health officials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported the second case in Travis County, in a vaccinated adult who had traveled to a state outside Texas that is experiencing a measles outbreak. The patient is isolating at home.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last week&lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/fifth-confirmed-measles-case-in-colorado-adult-with-recent-international-travel"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Colorado reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its fifth case, involving a vaccinated adult who had traveled to an outbreak area in Chihuahua, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5018"&gt;&lt;u&gt;And Los Angeles County&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is reporting a measles case in a resident who had recently traveled to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a group of friends gets together at a bar or gathers for an intimate dinner, conversations can quickly multiply and mix, with different groups and pairings chatting over and across one another.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Navigating this lively jumble of words—and focusing on the ones that matter—is particularly difficult for people with some form of hearing loss. Bustling conversations can become a fused mess of chatter, even if someone has hearing aids, which often struggle to filter out background noise. It's known as the "cocktail party problem"—and Boston University researchers believe they might have a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new brain-inspired &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/algorithm/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; developed at BU could help hearing aids tune out interference and isolate single talkers in a crowd of voices. In testing, researchers found it could improve word recognition accuracy by 40 percentage points relative to current hearing aid algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were extremely surprised and excited by the magnitude of the improvement in performance—it's pretty rare to find such big improvements," says Kamal Sen, the algorithm's developer and a BU College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00414-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Engineering&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some estimates put the number of Americans with hearing loss at close to 50 million; by 2050, around 2.5 billion people globally are expected to have some form of hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The primary complaint of people with hearing loss is that they have trouble communicating in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/noisy+environments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;noisy environments&lt;/a&gt;," says Virginia Best, a BU Sargent College of Health &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Sciences research associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences. "These environments are very common in daily life and they tend to be really important to people—think about dinner table conversations, social gatherings, workplace meetings. So, solutions that can enhance communication in noisy places have the potential for a huge impact."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Best was a co-author on the study with Sen and BU biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate Alexander D. Boyd. As part of the research, they also tested the ability of current hearing aid algorithms to cope with the cacophony of cocktail parties. Many hearing aids already include noise-reduction algorithms and directional microphones (beamformers) designed to emphasize sounds coming from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We decided to benchmark against the industry standard algorithm that's currently in hearing aids," says Sen. That existing algorithm "doesn't improve performance at all; if anything, it makes it slightly worse. Now we have data showing what's been known anecdotally from people with hearing aids."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen has patented the new algorithm—known as BOSSA, which stands for biologically oriented sound segregation algorithm—and is hoping to connect with companies interested in licensing the technology. He says that with Apple jumping into the hearing aid market—its latest AirPod Pro 2 headphones are advertised as having a clinical-grade hearing aid function—the BU team's breakthrough is timely: "If hearing aid companies don't start innovating fast, they're going to get wiped out, because Apple and other startups are entering the market."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Successfully segregating sounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 20 years, Sen has been studying how the brain encodes and decodes sounds, looking for the circuits involved in managing the cocktail party effect. With researchers in his Natural Sounds &amp;amp; Neural Coding Laboratory, he's plotted how sound waves are processed at different stages of the auditory pathway, tracking their journey from the ear to translation by the brain. One key mechanism: inhibitory neurons, brain cells that help suppress certain, unwanted sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"You can think of it as a form of internal noise cancelation," he says. "If there's a sound at a particular location, these inhibitory neurons get activated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sen, different neurons are tuned to different locations and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's approach is the inspiration for the new algorithm, which uses spatial cues like the volume and timing of a sound to tune into or tune out of it, sharpening or muffling a speaker's words as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's basically a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; that mimics what the brain does," says Sen, who's affiliated with BU's centers for neurophotonics and for systems neuroscience, "and actually segregates sound sources based on sound input."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physicist who later trained in neuroscience, Sen says he came to BU in part because of the opportunity to work with the University's Hearing Research Center, where he's now a faculty member. He turned to clinical researchers for help testing the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, the only way to know if a benefit will translate to the listener is via behavioral studies," says Best, an expert on spatial perception and hearing loss, "and that requires scientists and clinicians who understand the target population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly a research scientist at Australia's National Acoustic Laboratories, Best helped design a study using a group of young adults with sensorineural hearing loss, typically caused by genetic factors or childhood diseases. In a lab, participants wore headphones that simulated people talking from different nearby locations. Their ability to pick out select speakers was tested with the aid of the new algorithm, the current standard algorithm, and no algorithm. Boyd helped collect much of the data and was the lead author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;h2&gt;Applying the science beyond hearing loss: ADHD and autism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting their findings, the researchers wrote that the "biologically inspired algorithm led to robust intelligibility gains under conditions in which a standard beamforming approach failed. The results provide compelling support for the potential benefits of biologically inspired algorithms for assisting individuals with hearing loss in 'cocktail party' situations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're now in the early stages of testing an upgraded version that incorporates eye-tracking technology to allow users to better direct their listening attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science powering the algorithm might have implications beyond hearing loss too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The [neural] circuits we are studying are much more general purpose and much more fundamental," says Sen. "It ultimately has to do with attention, where you want to focus—that's what the circuit was really built for. In the long term, we're hoping to take this to other populations, like people with ADHD or autism, who also really struggle when there are multiple things happening."&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers showed that dopamine from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) drives the brain’s positive learning process during fear extinction, rather than simply suppressing fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption of this dopamine-driven pathway impaired the ability to unlearn fear, suggesting critical implications for anxiety and PTSD treatments. The findings highlight a precise neural mechanism that could lead to targeted therapies for fear-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine release from the VTA activates specific amygdala neurons to drive fear extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Fear extinction involves a reward-based learning process, not just suppression of fear memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting the pBLA-VTA dopamine pathway could aid treatments for PTSD and anxiety disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangers come but dangers also go and when they do, the brain has an “all-clear” signal that teaches it to extinguish its fear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109271"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author Susumu Tonegawa, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Tonegawa’s lab showed that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causal connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study.

However, the neurological nature of the teaching signal that instructs the formation of fear extinction memory in the &lt;em&gt;Ppp1r1b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; neurons is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic signaling drives fear extinction in distinct BLA neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that BLA fear and extinction neuronal populations receive topographically divergent inputs from VTA dopaminergic neurons via differentially expressed dopamine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry recordings of dopaminergic activity in the BLA reveal that dopamine (DA) activity is time-locked to freezing cessation in BLA fear extinction neurons, but not BLA fear neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this dopaminergic activity in BLA fear extinction neurons correlates with extinction learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using projection-specific optogenetic manipulation, we find that activation of the VTA DA projections to BLA reward and fear neurons accelerated or impaired fear extinction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, this work demonstrates that dopaminergic activity bidirectionally controls fear extinction by distinct patterns of activity at BLA fear and extinction neurons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:27:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBFdzJ5RTNFUFkteU1OZy10OTl6dTFQMkpDRG1ybUZHRDV4Sjhha094RVk5RWx0clJKcEFSZVhnZm80b1hZQ2V2Mi1CQy1GaE5Nd21ySkVKejQySlN0c0VzM0hmQQ</guid></item><item><title>弗吉尼亚州扩大了对接触麻疹儿童的地区的警告-《华盛顿邮报》 | Virginia expands warning on areas exposed to child with measles - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQeVhSOGVNTzYtNDNiZlVObGpFZHNhb3VDWGNITnI1MHQ2bUFSRFlkUlIybWhNOHF0aklIckRfRG1qcEtFYTZOakttSUVzUThtTzlsREhCZ3J6SVZXblRtNC1ldnZxbXBlVDZrR2I1XzRPdEMxRWZiZXIyYUNPWTdZUWhpdWdSQ0M1QnN2VFo1ZkpFRkg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2K2KGPARLJCYJGX4S5NHWVETCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia public health officials on Monday released more detail on the areas in local medical facilities where people may have been exposed to a young child with the state’s first 2025 case of measles, a highly contagious disease on the rise across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ZA7ZVDSFRCPBM2AZ43K6NGKLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The child, who was described as age 4 or younger, was contagious while visiting Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge on two days in mid-April, according to a statement from the Virginia Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B667WQMJURH6HOCIOY4BO4C2PY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/19/virginia-measles-northern-exposed-child/"&gt;The Virginia case&lt;/a&gt; stems from international travel, and not a measles outbreak in West Texas that has led to the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/06/measles-texas-death-outbreak-vaccine/"&gt;deaths of two children&lt;/a&gt;, officials said.

&lt;p&gt;The result could transform efforts to reach the three-quarters of children globally who should receive the vaccines but don’t. The shots prevent cervical cancer and also anal, penile, and some head-and-neck cancers. Worldwide, 350,000 women die from cervical cancer, the most common HPV cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that one dose and two doses of … these fantastic vaccines work really well,” said Aimée R. Kreimer, the NCI investigator who presented the new data here Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. “We’re really excited about these results.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, including the U.S., two doses of the vaccines are currently recommended. But in the clinical trial, whether one dose or two doses were used, the results were equivalent, according to the study of 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16 in Costa Rica who were followed for 4 1/2 years. In all cases, the estimated efficacy of the vaccines was upwards of 97%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experts were fast to praise the results. Chyke A. Doubeni, chief health equity officer The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, called them “phenomenal” from the conference stage. He grew up in Nigeria and said he could imagine the findings could help expand access to more people in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Norman “Ned” Sharpless, who was NCI director in the first Trump administration and is now a managing director at Jupiter Bioventures, echoed those comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is the most important cancer prevention trial going on in the world. We have a long history of failure in cancer prevention,” Sharpless said. “To have such clear evidence to support our practice is terrific and this will make the dissemination of HPV vaccine worldwide much easier and much cheaper to do — and it will save millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The results could prove controversial not because of science but U.S. politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has long criticized HPV vaccines, particularly Gardasil, made by Merck, which is the HPV vaccine used in the U.S. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1618279143468306435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;asserted on social media&lt;/a&gt; that Gardasil may increase the risk of cervical cancer, a claim contradicted by many studies. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he refused to disavow previous comments he had made questioning the safety of the vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Children’s Health Defense, the nonprofit group where he served as founder and chairman for years, Kennedy&lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/victoria-trevisan-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-injury-merck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; filed more than two dozen lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the vaccine. During the nomination process, he promised to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/31/rfk-jr-hhs-gardasil-litigation-fees-divest-son-wisner-baum/"&gt;give any fees&lt;/a&gt; he earned from the Gardasil litigation to his son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But from the start, the development of the HPV vaccines and studies of them could be traced back to the NCI, which is part of HHS. The institute’s deputy director, currently its highest-ranking official, is Douglas Lowy, who was a key figure in the development of the vaccines. He has won multiple scientific prizes, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, for his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NCI has also spent decades studying how to increase the uptake of hepatitis B and HPV vaccines as a way of preventing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Kreimer celebrate the presentation of their HPV vaccine trial at the AACR meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Courtesy NCI&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, the HPV vaccines have had a dramatic impact. In the U.S., Kreimer said, they have decreased the incidence of precancerous cervical lesions by 80% — particularly impressive because only 77% of people in the U.S. who should receive the vaccine have been administered at least one dose. In the U.S. and other developed countries, effective screening against these lesions means that other types of HPV cancer, in particular head-and-neck cancer, are as common as cervical cancer. This is one reason vaccination is recommended for boys as well as girls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies across the world have affirmed that HPV vaccination does prevent cancer. In one &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/"&gt;stunning recent example&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland said in 2024 that, of girls in the country who were born between 1988-1996 and had been vaccinated in time, none had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Australia has said that it believes it can eliminate cervical cancer through vaccination and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, giving two shots of the vaccine has been difficult to achieve on a wide scale among adolescents — a reality that cancer prevention experts have long lamented. In 2019, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933a1.htm?s_cid=mm6933a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;54.2%&lt;/a&gt; of adolescents had received two shots of an HPV vaccination. But these new data suggest that the picture is perhaps not as dire as originally feared.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In less developed countries, screening for cervical pre-cancers is far less common. These have always been the places where the HPV vaccines could have the biggest impact — but, because the vaccines are costly and because having to give multiple shots of a vaccine makes rolling it out more difficult in these countries — the vaccines have had the least impact there. In her talk, Kreimer said that only 24% of the girls who should get the vaccine worldwide do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why showing that one dose of the vaccines is as effective as two could be so important. And much of this important work has come from the NCI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rolando Herrero, one of the researchers involved in the new study, was the lead investigator of a study that in 2007 first raised the prospect that fewer doses of an HPV vaccine could be just as effective. That study, the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, tested three doses of the vaccine Cervarix, which was the dosage used at the time. But 20% of the volunteers in the study received fewer than three doses, in part because there were contraindications to receiving other doses — including becoming pregnant. It appeared that those who received only one dose were protected from HPV just as well as those who were fully vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This flew in the face of vaccine dogma,” Kreimer said. At the time, researchers thought protein-based vaccines like Cervarix always needed at least two doses to result in a durable result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the finding led to other research, including a study in India where a trial stoppage meant that many patients only received one dose of the vaccine. The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moved to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a one-dose HPV vaccine course. The U.K. also moved to recommend giving just one dose in 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will not be much debate about using one dose in countries where vaccination has proved difficult. Kathrin Jansen, who led development of Gardasil at Merck and is now retired, noted that in a setting where people are not vaccinated one dose is certainly better than none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s going to be any finding in the recent past that’s going to democratize cervical cancer control as much as these studies have,” said CS Pramesh, of the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, from the AACR stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is a question of how quickly the U.S. will consider moving to a single-dose regimen. There are still gaps in the data. For instance, researchers could want more follow-up on vaccine durability. And there are no data on other types of cancers HPV causes, particularly with regard to cancers of the mouth and throat. Still, in recent deliberations, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has seemed open to a change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Merck’s recent earnings calls, the company’s chief scientific officer, Dean Li, pushed back against the idea that such a move would come quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I would just emphasize: we have had clear , firm, consistent, and recent guidance from the FDA on what  [they] would require for the licensure of a reduced dosing or a single dose. They are very clear on the high evidentiary standard,” Li said, according to a transcript. He added: “The FDA is incredibly up-to-date and aware of the limitations of existing trials, and none meet the criteria for them to have a label change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kreimer pointed out that the benefit of change could be measured in lives saved.  &lt;br&gt;“Cervical cancer is a horrible disease, and outside the U.S., in lower-income countries, it is a death sentence the incidence is the mortality,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better then, to keep the cancer from ever happening in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

When doctors received the results, they urged her to go to the emergency room immediately. She learned she had acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive blood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt so scared. I kind of blacked out,” she recalls. “I was like, ‘There’s no way she just said that. No way.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Sinus infection leads to cancer diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the months-long headache and pressure in her nose felt annoying, Hunter thought she simply had a sinus infection she couldn’t kick. When she struggled to walk up stairs or to class at Texas A&amp;amp;M, she became worried. At a follow-up appointment in October 2024, she shared her new symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I told them that the headaches are still here. I’m very weak and had fatigue,” she says. “They recommended doing a blood test.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter loathes needles, yet she finally agreed to undergo the testing after the doctor’s urging. When her results first came back, Hunter didn’t realize how serious they were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinic staffer said, ‘Your levels are all over the place and it’s not looking good. (You’re) very anemic,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While they urged her to head to the emergency room, she only heard anemic and thought she could simply pick up iron pills at a pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re like, ‘No no, I don’t think that will work,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter tried going to an emergency room close to campus but they were full, so she decided to drive home to League City, Texas. She had Googled her blood results and thought she figured out what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like, ‘Mom, I think I have leukemia,’” Hunter says. “She’s like, ‘Don’t say that. That’s not what you have.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she arrived at the emergency room, they admitted her and ran numerous tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had many people coming in and saying, ‘It’s looking like a sign of leukemia, but we’ll keep testing because it could be a bunch of other things,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg" alt="It felt tough spending so much time in the hospital while undergoing cancer treatments.

I was like am I going to survive this? Or is it treatable?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors transferred to MD Anderson in Houston, where Hunter underwent more blood tests for doctors to understand what type of leukemia she had and how to best treat it. She also underwent a bone marrow aspiration and a spinal tap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors determined she had high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and she needed to remain in the hospital for treatment, which included seven days straight of chemotherapy infusions with a pill, which was part of a clinical trial. After 21 days, doctors tested Hunter’s bone marrow again to see if the treatment worked and she did a second seven-day round of chemotherapy with the pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was supposed to get at least six rounds,” Hunter says. “The chemo worked so well I only had to do two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors believed she would do best with a stem cell transplant and her brother, Roy, 21, was a perfect match. After undergoing 11 rounds of radiation to kill any possible lingering cancer cells in her brain and spine plus an new intense round of chemotherapy, she underwent the transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I got a radiation/chemo burn all over my body, which was very very painful and I was pretty much burnt all over,” she says. The chemotherapy regimen “was harder than the leukemia one.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Following the transplant, she remained in the hospital for more than a month to make sure everything went well and protect her from potential infection from her weakened immune system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably towards the end I was over it. I was like, ‘I can’t do this. This is too much,’” Hunter recalls. “It was very hard at times but God’s watching me. So, I knew I was going to be OK.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer. It is actually one of the most common blood cancers in adults,” Dr. Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, tells TODAY.com. “It can present quite dramatically with life threatening infections or bleeding problems or … blood abnormalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg" alt="Navigating cancer treatment during her final year of college has been challenging for Breeze Hunter but having the support of her family, friends and boyfriend has helped her.

But you really have lost your normal immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In these cases, people normally do not improve after treatments for their infections and follow-up tests indicate something amiss with their blood cell counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Not everyone presents that way,” DiNardo explains. “But it is one of the presentations we see — strange infections,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinical trial Hunter participated in was targeted to the type of “higher risk leukemia” she had that doesn’t “respond well to standard intensive chemotherapy.” AML isn’t staged like other cancers and high risk or adverse risk is the most serious form that has “certain features that make them less likely to go into a remission and less likely to stay in a remission and be cured,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The response rates are low, and unfortunately, many people don’t survive,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-025-02531-8.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Phase II investigation&lt;/a&gt; Hunter participated in is aimed at patients who have the same type of acute myeloid leukemia she has with a KMT2A translocation. Hunter received a chemotherapy regimen called FLAG-IDA with a pill called venetoclax. The pill is FDA approved for older patients who cannot handle powerful cancer treatments, DiNardo says. In Hunter’s case, she underwent an “intensive chemotherapy program with venetoclax added in as part of a clinical trial.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing such phenomenal outcomes, and this is not an FDA approved regimen yet,” DiNardo says. “We continue to expand this trial to enroll more patients and allow more patients to benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter responded well to the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s doing fantastic,” DiNardo says. “Being a college student in the prime of your life getting dealt a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, I can only imagine how life altering and depressing it could be. But she’s always had such a beautiful spirit and good attitude.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'It keeps me positive' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While in the hospital, Hunter decided to document her experience. She even created a MTV “Cribs” type TikTok of her hospital room that went viral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We did it as a joke and I posted it and it blew up instantly,” she says. “I have never gone viral.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People shared their own experiences with AML or different cancers and Hunter met new friends that helped her navigate her experience with cancer. After the local news reported on Hunter, she met a young girl, Zoe, who has the same cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s 6 years old and she’s had a lot of side effects and problems,” Hunter says. “We’re best friends ... she is so young, and she has gone through way more than I have and it keeps me positive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After the intense treatment, Hunter finally feels better. Her immune system is strengthening, and she will be able to walk in her college graduation. It will be the first time she can be around such a large crowd of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m so excited,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Having her friends and family’s support as well as a strong faith helps Hunter cope with her diagnosis. She’ll be on maintenance chemotherapy for the next year but then she’s looking forward to swimming and boating again. Hunter hopes her story encourages others to take their health seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg" alt="After the local news shared Breeze Hunter's story, she met Zoe, on the left, who is 6 and has the same type of cancer as Hunter.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers have identified molecular evidence linking human papillomavirus (HPV) to thyroid eye disease (TED) through molecular mimicry involving HPV capsid proteins and autoimmune targets. Elevated antibody levels against HPV appeared in participants with TED, suggesting a possible immunological connection influencing disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;TED is marked by complex autoimmune features and unclear triggers. Managing its varied clinical manifestations remains a challenge. Symptoms include proptosis, diplopia, pain, dryness, and redness. Severe cases can lead to vision loss in 2% to 5% of patients. Among those with Graves disease, TED affects 25% to 50%, and among those with Hashimoto thyroiditis, 3% to 5%. TED also appears in individuals with euthyroidism and hypothyroidism, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond thyroid dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoantibodies that up-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) have been primarily implicated. Yet TED cases without thyroid dysfunction prompted hypotheses involving &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mimicry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mimicry&lt;/a&gt; by pathogens. Reports of TED following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection reinforced this theory and suggested that an infectious agent could trigger autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study titled "Human Papillomavirus and Thyroid Eye Disease," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2832966" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted an experimental study to explore the potential involvement of viral infections in TED pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbital adipose tissue samples were collected from 11 patients with TED undergoing orbital decompression surgery and 11 control patients undergoing blepharoplasty. Among the 22 patients, the mean age was 58.6 years, ranging from 37.4 to 74.4 years. Female patients accounted for 86.4% of the study population.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers used the publicly available Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to perform protein homology analysis comparing IGF-1R and TSHR against various viral proteomes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; type 18 (HPV18) L1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels from the collected adipose tissue samples. Optical density (OD) readings from ELISA measured HPV18 L1 IgG antibody levels. OD values were used to estimate the extent of antibody binding detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed that IGF-1R and TSHR shared homologous sequences with major capsid proteins of the Papillomaviridae family, as well as proteins from Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Enteroviruses, Polyomaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families. Two conserved motifs, FGXV and IXEXT+NP, were identified across all HPV serotypes and both human IGF-1R and TSHR sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean normalized OD levels for HPV18 L1 IgG differed between groups. Controls had a mean OD of 0.94. Patients with chronic TED had a mean OD of approximately 2.31, and patients with acute active TED had a mean OD of approximately 4.09. Both chronic and acute active TED groups showed higher normalized OD levels compared with controls, with acute active TED displaying the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No correlations appeared between HPV18 L1 IgG levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels. Radioactive iodine treatment or thyroidectomy did not affect antibody levels. Elevated IgG titers appeared irrespective of treatment with teprotumumab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that viral molecular mimicry between HPV and key autoimmunity targets, IGF-1R and TSHR, could contribute to the development of TED. Elevated antibodies against HPV18 L1 capsid protein in patients with TED suggest a potential immunological mechanism influencing disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of viral mimicry as a possible factor offers new possibilities for prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches. Although the study cohort is small and does not establish causation, recognizing viral exposure as a contributing factor could guide future diagnostic and treatment research.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'Understanding how mortality patterns vary by birth cohort within each state can inform decision-making around resource allocation and public health interventions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 80 for women and 74 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042825"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, collected mortality data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and calculated the number of deaths that occurred between 1969 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This resulted in 179million deaths in all 50 states and Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-b6fecec0-2463-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though life expectancy for men increased in most states, rates stayed the same as the 1990s for men in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/west-virginia/index.html" id="mol-2314a020-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-2314a021-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men in West Virginia lived to 70 in both 1995 and 2020. The same was true for Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In New Mexico, men lived to 72 in 1995 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And women in Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oklahoma all saw drops from the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mississippi, for example, the life expectancy for women dropped from 76 to 75. West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Alabama each saw a drop from 77 to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly why these states saw decreases, the researchers suggested it could be due to increasing rates of poverty and chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Mississippi is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13684195/South-state-diabetes-cancer-kidney-disease-healthcare-rank-Mississippi.html"&gt;the poorest state&lt;/a&gt; in the US and has the lowest median household income per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average household brings home $48,716 before taxes, according to World Population Review, significantly lower than the national average of $80,610.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poverty limits access to healthy foods, medications and regular doctor's appointments, increasing the risk of developing chronic conditions like obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest CDC data, Mississippi has the second-highest rate of heart disease deaths behind Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And West Virginia &lt;span&gt;has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12943237/West-Virginia-America-UNHEALTHIEST-state.html"&gt;consistently topped the charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for rates of chronic disease. More than half of West Virginia's residents are obese, for example, and it has the nation's highest smoking rate of 23 percent. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 77. Women have an average life expectancy of 80 while men are expected to live to 74&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Washington DC saw the greatest improvement in life expectancy from 1969 to 2020, jumping from 70 to 80 years for women and 61 to 73 for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due in part to Washington DC having the country's lowest obesity rate of 23 percent. Additionally, the researchers wrote the city's small population could make it more sensitive to statistical changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city of 678,000 is also entirely urban, giving it increased access to healthy foods and healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also calculated the number of years it would take in each state for the death rate of people over 35 to double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This measures how quickly the mortality rate increases with age. The shorter the rate, the faster death rates surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Iowa, the death rate for women doubles at age 43, the fastest rate in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Washington DC, however, the rate doubles for women starting at age 47, the study's slowest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Mississippi &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10499713/Mississippi-lowest-levels-life-expectancy-20-live-poverty-74-4-years.html"&gt;had the lowest life expectancy in 2020 for both men and women.&lt;/a&gt; The average age for men was 69, while women lived to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following closely behind for both sexes was West Virginia with 70 years for men and 76 for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For women, Kentucky and Alabama tied for third-lowest life expectancy at 76.4 years. Arkansas and Oklahoma rounded out the top five, tying for a life expectancy of 77 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, Alabama and Louisiana both had a life expectancy of 70 years. Kentucky rounded out the top five with a life expectancy of 71 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy for both sexes with 84 years for women and 77 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to low rates of chronic disease. The Aloha state had the second-lowest heart disease mortality rate in 2022, for example, behind Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Hawaii has the third-lowest obesity rate of 26 percent, outranked only by Colorado and Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations of the study, including a lack of data on how Covid may have altered the average life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 19:14:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZEpFODNIRjM5ZDVaS21YYVZKdTdFYlZYT2g5eUlILUZRLWNzdGtiTDMyQ2VzYml1SVdhZVpZdjc3dk1LY3p3WGphTEZ0MlJDbVZnQUtDNFBYdnMyTlRGR0poX21VNVdtVDJRclRvb1BCSWFyNENpZF9PQkxCemFrOWFwb25TNG80SmJuUnJxQ2JfWmNQakdVZzN4QWNzb2NaakV5SkZn0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9xaGZ1d0dXZU0zWlhVWVJyQVp2N3F0bGppRkVZS1V2T1dmNjBoTFdKTzFBdEM5eEpFNEphX1h2bWJYd1BROGxULUwtZVNTdjlQMldxeUNxU05mY21hZXBJMGtCdDJxbmhnRVdhMTIzTllwaWRFcUFMTnhPVXpYZmNLUWhQYTgwM1llczRwOFBKR29CZG41UVBCcDFNZUlHY1RadXp6LVhHQU45UQ</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品与美国124,000多例可预防死亡有关- Healthline | Ultra-Processed Foods Tied to More Than 124,000 Preventable Deaths in U.S. - Healthline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOTEhUa291UGttbEZScVRNSXlOWndmWm9mN0FxYTRLcm41d2JfZWtOSktwVTY4aEozTVNUVDRBR2llc1ZnT1JwTnJHdjZuNFFtUkRBYTVhSDl4UE13LXJuT25JbFZ4b2NVeU5TMWlXYlRmLWNQeWdaOFJNMExWTnhBM0VJbzdTOFVacWhmeVBnRTQ2QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg" alt="Overhead image of cheeseburger and fries" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-1dn5h5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth-news%2Fultraprocessed-foods-premature-death-global-study&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2Fprocessed-food-1296x728-header.jpg&amp;amp;description=Ultra-Processed%20Foods%20Linked%20to%20Over%20124%2C000%20Premature%20Deaths%20in%20U.S." title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1dutyn6"&gt;A global study linked thousands of preventable deaths to ultra-processed food consumption.

The average contribution of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/more-evidence-links-ultra-processed-foods-to-premature-preventable-death" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; to the total energy intake also varied among countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest consumption of ultra-processed foods was in Colombia (2015) and Brazil (2017–2018), where less than 20% of total energy intake was made up of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chile (2010) and Mexico (2016), the intake increased to 20–30% of total energy intake. In Australia (2011–2012) and Canada (2016), the ratio of ultra-processed food intake increased significantly, with UPFs comprising 37.5% of daily energy intake in Australia and 43.7% in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States (2017–2018) and the United Kingdom (2018–2019), the contribution of UPFs to total energy intake exceeded 50%. These nations had the highest number of premature deaths associated with UPFs, with nearly 18,000 in the U.K. and more than 124,000 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/christopher-gardner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Christopher Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a nutrition scientist and professor of medicine at Stanford University, said the findings are an important addition to the research into ultra-processed foods. Gardner wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors showed that regardless of the general consumption levels, there were consistently higher &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/morbidity-vs-mortality" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;mortality &lt;/a&gt;levels among the subset of the population within each of those countries who consumed the most vs. the least UPF. In other words, even in a country where only 15% of the food being sold was UPF, those consuming the most vs. the least had detectably different rates of mortality,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It would/should be easier to see that difference in a country like the U.S. or U.K. where the general consumption rate is much higher. Helpful to note that they also found it across the range of consumption levels in different countries. That is an interesting and important addition the field of knowledge about UPF.

Hunnes wasn’t involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The consumption of UPFs contribute quite significantly to an increased risk of death (and disease) and that we should all work harder (and encourage greater regulation) to reduce the consumption of UPFs both in our own lives and in the food systems as well,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(UPFs) are high in calories, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, salt, fat, but low in nutrients. They are stripped of all their naturally occurring health properties. All fiber has essentially been removed, vitamins and minerals found naturally (ie. in the husk of a grain) have been removed, and in their place are chemicals and adulterated “foods” that bare no resemblance to their natural counterpart.

Due to the availability of fast food and fast-food choices in the supermarket as compared to other countries that prepare more food at home, the US may choose these foods more simply by having increased access to them,” &lt;a href="https://kanwarkelleymd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Kanwar Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, MD, JD, board certified otolaryngologist (ENT) and co-founder and CEO of Side Health told Healthline.

Ali wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although education at an early age may help people make healthier food choices, most people do not look that critically at their diet and are more apt to choose food based on taste and convenience,” Ali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whole grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lean-protein-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lean proteins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-healthy-nuts" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; and dairy are healthier. In general fruits as an alternative to sweets like cookies and ice cream is better.

Our findings suggest that any exercise, if completed regularly (three to four times per week for about 30-45 minutes) may be beneficial for brain health,” she said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All exercise protects against brain volume loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that participants in both EXERT exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In EXERT, our finding that participants tend to show less brain volume loss over 12 months suggests that the intervention may protect against cell loss in the prefrontal region, which may help to protect the cognitive abilities that this region supports, against decline,” &lt;a href="https://gerigeropal.ucsd.edu/research/faculty.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aladdin Shadyab, PhD, MPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aladdin Shadyab, PhD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and School of Medicine and lead author of the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70118" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EXERT-ADNI study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EXERT-ADNI study&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prefrontal cortex is an area of the brain that plays a proportionately larger role in cognitive abilities that allow us to pay attention, multi-task, plan, and organize,” Baker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all lose brain cells as we age.

foods for better options and quitting the unhealthy treats she wanted to stay away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, she said that people were 'just taking it just to get skinny and that’s not true', saying that many who start on the drug don't realise that they still 'have to do the work' of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Other people the outlet spoke to agreed that just jabbing yourself with Ozempic wasn't a ticket to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Edward Matias, 45, told them it 'takes work and commitment', and if someone was hoping they could just take some Ozempic and 'think they can eat anything at all' then they'd get a 'rude awakening'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's not a 'magic bullet' (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He's been on the drug for a year and seven months and in that time he's shed about 80lbs, and for many of those taking Ozempic on a more long term basis they have found themselves losing significant amounts of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, they reckon that Ozempic was more of a way to push for lifestyle changes that made them healthier than being a 'magic bullet' that fixed all woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Various celebrities who've spoken about the impact of taking Ozempic and said it wasn't for them have also discussed some of the side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-jeremy-clarkson-186304-20250331"&gt;said he was 'sick a lot' &lt;/a&gt;because his body didn't want to eat but his 'mind still wanted to breakfast on Cadbury Fruit &amp;amp;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Gus Saltonstall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has been in the headlines as of late. With more than 900 confirmed cases across the country so far in 2025, it is already the second most-active year for the disease since the United States declared measles eliminated in 2000, according to multiple reports, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;including The New York Times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of measles cases this year are connected to an outbreak in the Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York there have only been four confirmed measles cases this year, with three of them coming from New York City. There have been no confirmed cases of measles on the Upper West Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the publication &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/how-well-is-your-nyc-neighborhood-protected-against-measles-check-out-our-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gothamist created a map&lt;/a&gt; of the measles vaccination rates by ZIP code among children 24 to 35 months old in the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rate of 95 percent is needed for herd immunity, but the citywide rate for this age group currently sits at around 81 percent, according to the data. This is a decline from an 88 percent vaccination rate in New York City in 2019 for the same age bracket, &lt;a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/03/07/measles-cases-nyc-symptoms-how-to-protect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ChalkBeat reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the measles vaccination rates for kids 24 to 35 months old in each Upper West Side ZIP code, &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/how-well-is-your-nyc-neighborhood-protected-against-measles-check-out-our-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Gothamist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10025: 80 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10024: 87 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10023: 76 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10069: 82 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these vaccination rates are also expected to grow for this cohort of two-year-olds as they approach kindergarten, as New York has strict school vaccination rules that require children to get two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these doses, though, is generally given within the first 12 to 15 months of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state also does not allow for religious exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are numbers that are still deeply troubling,” Hochul said in a press conference about the measles vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest measles vaccination rates within New York City were seen on Staten Island, where no ZIP code had higher than 74 percent, according to Gothamist.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 5-6
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — As you add more ultraprocessed foods to your diet, your risk of a premature death from any cause rises, according to a new meta-analysis of research involving more than 240,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked at the risk of a person dying from eating more ultraprocessed foods between the ages of 30 and 69, a time when it would be premature to die," said study coauthor Carlos Augusto Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil's University of São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that for each 10% increase in total calories from ultraprocessed foods, the risk of dying prematurely rose by nearly 3%," said Monteiro, who coined the term "ultraprocessed" in 2009 when he developed NOVA, a system of classifying foods into four groups by their level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group one of the NOVA system is unprocessed or minimally processed foods in their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs. Group two includes culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned goods and frozen vegetables are examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group four includes ultraprocessed foods. By Monteiro's definition, ultraprocessed foods contain little to no whole foods. Instead, they are manufactured from "chemically manipulated cheap ingredients" and often use "synthetic additives to make them edible, palatable and habit-forming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products," Monteiro cowrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal The BMJ. "The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Sarah Gallo, Consumer Brands Association&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is misleading and will lead to consumer confusion, said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods," Gallo said in an email, "resulting in decreased diet quality, increased risk of food-borne illness and exacerbated health disparities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just a serving a day matters, studies say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is not the first to find an association between negative health outcomes and small increases in ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;February 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found "strong" evidence that people who ate more ultraprocessed food had a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of ultraprocessed foods might also increase the risk of anxiety by up to 53%, obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression or an early death from any cause by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the February study defined a higher intake as one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A May 2024 study found that adding just 10% of ultraprocessed food to an otherwise healthy diet may also increase the risk of cognitive decline and stroke&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; while 2023 research determined that including 10% more ultraprocessed foods was linked to a greater chance of developing cancers of the upper digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that as much as 70% of the U.S. food supply is ultraprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two-thirds of the calories children consume in the U.S. are ultraprocessed, while about 60% of adult diets are ultraprocessed," Fang Fang Zhang, associate professor and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at Tufts University in Boston, told CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;in an earlier interview&lt;/a&gt;. Zhang was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A global estimate of preventable deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;, published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, took an additional step by estimating how many deaths might be prevented in eight countries with low, medium and high consumption of ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption," lead study author Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;(The study was unable to determine if the deaths were) caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Nerys Astbury,  University of Oxford&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note that the study was unable to determine if the deaths were "caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this," said nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury, an associate professor of diet and obesity at the UK's University of Oxford, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has the highest level of ultraprocessed food consumption in the world — nearly 55% of the average American's diet, according to the study. Researchers estimated that reducing the use of those ultraprocessed foods to zero would have prevented over 124,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries where consumption of ultraprocessed foods is low, such as Colombia (15% of the diet) and Brazil (17.4%), reducing the use to zero would have prevented nearly 3,000 deaths in the former country in 2015 and 25,000 deaths in the latter in 2017, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Stephen Burgess, University of Cambridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The authors set the theoretical minimal risk level to be 0. This implies a scenario where all UPFs are eliminated, which is highly unrealistic and nearly impossible in our current society," Zhang said in an email. "As a result, the estimated burden of pre-mature death due to UPFs could be overestimated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Burgess, a statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the UK's University of Cambridge, said that while the study cannot prove the consumption of ultraprocessed foods is harmful, "it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander," said Burgess, who was not involved in the study, in a statement.

Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9b6a1bb6-9e58-4029-880a-000dc982ad63" data-ng-block="{"&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a1a52593-0492-4b02-b25c-5337ef955017" data-ng-block="{"&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a target="_self" data-id="2700e212-6cf5-436e-8cde-0815003518d7" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a target="_self" data-id="2700e212-6cf5-436e-8cde-0815003518d7" href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bbe18608-a9f3-4775-bf43-d4b9a249e9e3" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e2dc1caf-230f-4659-934b-6774bb04f63c" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a target="_self" data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a data-id="0ea75d31-1af2-4481-9502-10377d44f3bd" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said.

That’s because they’re rich in choline, a nutrient related to B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWEUT74FNFGCXIWDZYLUCHLHSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Choline is critically important for a variety of body and brain functions,” says Ramon Velazquez, an assistant professor at the Arizona State University-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center in Tempe. It’s part of all cell membranes, and in recent years there’s been increasing evidence linking it to &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/mental-health/boost-your-brainpower-at-any-age-a1999739192/"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and even a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. But about 90 percent of people don’t get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The memory effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAF6AXK5QBB5PCV7RVDTJB2TIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. “These [neurotransmitters] are chemicals that build and connect neurons [nerve cells] in the brain and body, and allow them to communicate with each other,” says Thomas B. Shea, a professor of biological sciences at UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAL4REGZLBF5PC35NFYD56S3HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research has found that levels of acetylcholine naturally decline with age and that people with Alzheimer’s disease have lower-than-normal levels. “The connection is seen both in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s,” Velazquez says. “Lower levels of acetylcholine may affect your ability to form and recall memories, as well as affect word recall and focus.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8570899/"&gt;2021 study published in Behavioral Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people who got 188 to 400 mg per day of choline had a 40 percent reduced risk of experiencing low cognitive function than those who got less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TN66PRMGBHARFXGAHNYJ72HJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests that specific types of choline may be more beneficial than others. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522013375?via%3Dihub"&gt;2019 study involving almost 500 men, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, every 50 mg intake per day of phosphatidylcholine was linked to a 10 percent decrease in dementia risk. Eggs were the main source of it in the men’s diet. A large egg has 169 mg of choline, about 70 percent of which is phosphatidylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4CSLFF23WJBCBHVB7B74BBEIVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s even the potential that increasing choline intake after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis may help. “In studies of people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease,” Velazquez says, “we’ve seen that supplementing with choline may slow the progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6M4OQNPZNZBDDORIQVSQKNG6XE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other benefits to making sure that your diet contains plenty of choline. It plays a role in both fat and glucose metabolism. “Not getting enough choline can increase the risk of fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases,” Velazquez says. Adequate choline may also protect against heart disease and strokes by helping to control the inflammation that contributes to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GD3S6BP5KJFNBOGPVZII5POLBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Your body produces some choline, but it’s nowhere near enough to perform all of these critical functions,” Velazquez says. The Daily Value for choline is 550 mg, and that needs to come from food or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3V2VNMOEBJC6BNGJ2PBCKUIUPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s not hard to get the choline you need through diet,” Shea says. Many foods contain at least some, and there are several that provide substantial amounts (see below). “But sometimes older adults start eating fewer calories or less variety of foods. In that case, supplementation may be in order.” Supplements can also be a good idea for people who eat a mostly plant-based diet because many of the foods highest in choline are animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWX5G7P2R5H7LHX2BU533KCJAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You might not be able to rely on a multivitamin to help meet your choline needs, though; some brands contain little to none of the nutrient. If you’re going to take a supplement, Shea recommends choosing one that has about 300 mg. As with any supplement, you should discuss it with your doctor beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Top sources of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KY6JF7K2EVEMPDPM7KYEKVOXGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can find choline in a variety of foods, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="NZEOLVL3TZHRLDVU75FK4MGYXA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beef liver, 3.5 oz.

            As of 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, have been confirmed in six countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating.
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;From 1 January to 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, were confirmed in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the 205 cases of measles reported in the same period in 2024. The cases have been reported from six countries: Argentina (n= 21 cases), Belize (n= 2 cases), Brazil (n= 5 cases), Canada &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1] &lt;/sup&gt;(n=1069 cases), Mexico &lt;sup&gt;[2] &lt;/sup&gt;(n= 421 cases including one death), and the United States of America &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; (n=800 cases, including two deaths).&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Epidemic curve showing confirmed cases of measles in the Regions of the Americas, by week 1 January- 18 April 2025 (n = 2318)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/measles-paho-epi-curve.jpg?sfvrsn=d8d9617d_3" title="Measles PAHO Epi curve" alt="Measles PAHO Epi curve" sf-size="61504"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Geographical distribution of the confirmed cases between 1 January- 18 April 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/map-measles-paho.png?sfvrsn=44229178_3" title="Map measles PAHO" alt="Map measles PAHO" sf-size="743313"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview by countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argentina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Argentina reported 21 confirmed cases of measles; 10 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and 11 in Buenos Aires Province. Of these, three cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and five cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index case was reported on 31 January 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The second case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 February 2025. Neither of the two cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 April, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only two cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS "Carlos G. Malbrán," with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 April 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Wellness confirmed two positive measles cases—Belize’s first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, México, from 5 January to 31 March 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2 April and 3 April 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 April 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%.  In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the second dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 18 April 2025, Brazil reported five confirmed cases of measles across four locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and São Paulo (1). The two cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under one year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 February and 2 March, 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 March 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 April 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in São Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 April 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 12 April 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another.  Between 27 October 2024 and 12 April 2025, 971 cases have been reported in seven provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, between 1 January and 12 April 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of two or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: two imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n= 4), Chihuahua (n= 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n= 4), Querétaro (n= 1), Sinaloa (n= 1), Sonora (n= 5), Tamaulipas (n= 2) and Zacatecas (n= 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 January and developed symptoms on 10 February. On 14 February, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 February, the second confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 February, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8.  Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases were among those aged 25–44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n= 145), followed by children aged 5–9 years (13,5%, n= 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n= 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n=16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n=16) had received two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States of America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 17 April 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including two confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n= 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more cases), with ten outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of five accounted for 31% (n=249) of cases, individuals aged 5–19 for 38% (n=304), adults over 20 for 29% (n=231), and age was unknown for 2 % (n=16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received two doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n=85 of 800). Among children under five, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about four days before and up to four days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about one in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A two-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries.  Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil.  The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year, the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Ongoing virus circulation from      imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains,      secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Suboptimal vaccination coverage      persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over      95% coverage for the first MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the second      dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for      2024 is still being consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;An increasing number of susceptible      individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the      COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare,      especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons,      and Indigenous populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Tick season is upon New England — and some unexpected visitors have come up north to join the usual crew, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Massachusetts Amherst center has found and studied two ticks in Maine that are capable of infecting people with rare, possibly fatal, sicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Center of Excellence of Vector-borne Diseases, led by UMass Amherst microbiology professor Stephen Rich, scans residential backyards in New England as a part of an ongoing study in its third year to develop better practices for tick control, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of the sets of properties that we looked at in Maine, we found some rather extraordinary ticks that we don’t usually see,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual ticks found in the Northeast are deer, dog, and human ticks that often carry Lyme disease. In this survey, which catches ticks by placing down a white cloth and then extracting them, researchers found a “preponderous” amount of uncommon rabbit ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, some of these ticks carried a unique, rare microbe called Rickettsia similar to a strain found in California that has led to people contracting potentially fatal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said that rabbit ticks don’t often feed on humans, but a likely scenario is that a more common tick feeds on an infected rabbit that can then transmit to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low risk factor, but it is something that we didn’t know about until now, and it’s something we want to understand a little bit better and make sure that it is infrequent, and that it’s not something that has the potential to bridge over,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second case found does not cause disease, but rather an allergy — to red meat. Alpha-gal syndrome is becoming increasingly common in areas where the Lone Star tick, the usual culprit, is established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this year, alpha-gal syndrome has been found in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article#:~:text=Maine%20CDC%20received%20positive%20%CE%B1,were%20%3E65%20years%20of%20age."&gt;57 residents in Maine&lt;/a&gt;, whose climate is not typical for the Lone Star tick. The allergy was recently found to have been linked to the black-legged tick after a woman reported being bitten by one and then developing an intolerance to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding of not a tick but a patient that had alpha-gal … was what made that finding quite notable,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the most effective way to avoid tick bites is to treat clothing with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553150"&gt;permethrin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that can kill ticks and other arthropods within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick does bite, the time it takes for it to infect a person differs from case to case, but Rich said the average time for Lyme disease to enter a person’s body is 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take the tick off earlier, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposure from the stuff inside that tick,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the finding of both of these “relatively rare events” within the same time period is likely due to there being more surveillance — the team is able to look “more carefully than we did in the past,” thanks to the study, which received &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/cdc-designates-new-england-center-excellence-vector-borne-diseases-umass-amherst"&gt;$10 million&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing the testing to provide impactful information to homeowners,” Rich said. “Because we’re doing that, and that wasn’t taking place before, we’re bound to make new discoveries of this kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
