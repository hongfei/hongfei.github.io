'&lt;span&gt;It was really affecting me,' he said. 'I’m not one to be depressed, but it really bit into me.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six months without the medicine, Mr Kane's wife suggested he 'bite the bullet' and pay for more injections, to stop the decline of his health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When semaglitude, better known as Ozempic, was rolled out at a cheaper cost of £118, it became a more affordable option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; He has now been on taking the medication for nearly eight years—a maintenance dose of 1mg a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has no plans to stop again and said if he were to ever come off he'd become a 'very sad, dejected, depressed person.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic have burst onto the scene in recent years, hailed as a potential fix for the UK's spiraling obesity crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Semaglutide mimics glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a naturally occurring hormone released in the small intestine when you eat. It tells your brain you're full and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After years of rigorous scientific trials, semaglutide has been chemically modified to last far longer than the body’s own, short-lived supply of GLP-1. As a result, it keeps people feeling fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US researchers at Cornell University in New York found those on the injections typically lost &lt;span&gt;lost around 13.7 per cent of their body weight, on average, over a 72-week period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But a study in the journal Epic Research found that 44 per cent of people who lost at least five pounds using semaglutide and then stopped the drug regained at least 25 per cent of their lost weight within a year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Cunningham, an aesthetics expert who treats patients suffering cosmetic complications of Ozempic, said some choose to go on a maintenance dose and wean off the drug that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t be solely reliant on the drug,' she said. 'You need to be using this as an opportunity to address your lifestyle. Our most successful patients will have really gotten on board with healthy eating and exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the jabs help people stay motivated to make a change to a healthy lifestyle because they are seeing rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's those who become completely reliant on the drug, and fail to make lifestyle changes, who end up putting the weight back on, Dr Cuningham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at Oxford University discovered the effects of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy are short-lived if patients do not maintain a healthy lifestyle afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even those taking newer, more powerful jabs drugs like Mounjaro put their weight back on once treatment was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,' said researcher Professor Susan Jebb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:26:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOQXhveDJ2VmREVTNmVnhobE5HdkJ1dW1IRG9vWUt4ZGNxMHBLWF9JTUxDTzA4N19CZ0NCX0FraEVkU25QNmxZeGJzWjAtTWZNUDJ6em5abmdjajlIVG9jRTNJeTV4c0d6Tnhmamtiem5oSlpsR2NiODFsSU1TVWtlTUNCajYwSmlLUGhLb3RiYVhMM05hZHRvbjVn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1pSXZxTThmRXBZR1psMmZreTJkV214ZUVuXzFxc0lJaFJRLWNhSFQ0ZmFvRzVXdDdXTHVjdEZxTlZVSk5iSWZEMTdzM0NZd3VBeVNqS3VMYWdHUjJDREVFTnJPb3BDczZZLUdpNUhndE9PSWR6UnpDd3dTeFpyUC1tNGgzcHNfLTVNZ1loNk1iU2xVZzBmaVUtODZMZWtHWQ</guid></item><item><title>这只猫粪便寄生虫可以斩首精子-它可能会加剧不孕症- Gizmodo | This Cat Poop Parasite Can Decapitate Sperm—and It Might Be Fueling Infertility - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQNHVLVVYwTWo5TkE5REYtX1FPU0l4QmJRak5wZFhEZndhNmVYZXNtQU5uRTBMQlhDb2dFOVA1SGtTNzB1MFhVYTNUaVVnVC12dUlQblh2VFhTNW5qQXJHM2tvWnhMbmJyWS1wTWwxUm9LQTFvVTN4U3dQVWNNc3lyN1o2bnNZbmxUSHZQS29XU3NFUGowcXUxbE92dmE3R29NSjRnM1ktZnlienFuYnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet, and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that “human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact” with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs. In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems. Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people. Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay, and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates. In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite’s potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/bill-sullivan-703249"&gt;Bill Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/indiana-university-1368"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was in a coma for a little over a month due to sepsis following a perforated ulcer in my GI tract. I don't remember hearing anyone, although family and friends read to me, played recorded videos, etc. I remember 'being' in a dim, small room with velvet-flocked wallpaper, and 'being' in an Orange Julius in a mall food court with strangers. Then, I heard my mom say she was leaving on Thursday. I woke up and thought two days had passed."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;I lost more than a month, a third of my body weight, all my muscle tone, a lot of hair, and my vocal cords were damaged due to an emergency intubation.&lt;/b&gt; It took another month to regain muscle control to write notes and for my vocal cords and esophageal muscles to start healing. I had failed three swallow tests before I finally passed. It took over 11 weeks from ER admit to discharge. I had months of OT, PT, and speech afterwards. Fifteen months after discharge, I was completely cleared by all but GI doctor!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sportygoose966"&gt;sportygoose966&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers reviewed and re-analyzed data from dozens of studies to clarify when depression most strongly affects dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest late-life depression may be more than just a risk factor—it could be an early sign of dementia onset. These insights emphasize the urgent need to prioritize mental health care as a long-term strategy to protect brain health and prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression in both midlife and later life increases dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Late-life depression may signal the early stages of dementia development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Strategy Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health care should be central to dementia prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both mid and later life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, which is published in &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine, &lt;/em&gt;was led by Jacob Brain and Maha Alshahrani from the Institute of Mental Health and School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham, University of Adelaide and the Dementia Centre of Excellence at Curtin University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110495"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a face and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain said: “Our study shows that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both midlife and late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of recognising and treating depression across the life course, not just for mental health, but also as part of a broader strategy to protect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health efforts need to place greater emphasis on preventative brain health, including scaling up access to effective mental health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects over 57 million people globally. There is currently no cure, so identifying and treating the factors to reduce the risk, such as depression, is an important public health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential links between depression and dementia are complex and may include chronic inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, vascular changes, alterations to neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter imbalances. Shared genetic and behavioural related changes may also increase the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that people with depression are more likely to develop dementia later in life, but there’s been a lot of debate about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; depression matters most, whether it’s depression that starts in midlife – in your 40s or 50s, or depression that appears later in life – in your 60s or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings raise the possibility that depression late in life may not just be a risk factor, but it could also be an early warning sign of dementia beginning to develop. By clarifying this timing, our work helps guide future research, treatment, and prevention strategies,” says Mr Brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out an umbrella review and meta-analysis. They firstly gathered and reviewed all the best available data from systematic reviews with meta-analyses (a statistical method that combines results from multiple studies to provide a more reliable overall estimate), that had already looked at the link between depression and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then went a step further by extracting and re-analysing data from the individual studies within those reviews, plus they added in newer studies that were missed in the earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain adds: “We specifically focused on the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when depression was measured, whether it was measured in midlife or in later life, and calculated how much it increased the risk of developing dementia. This essentially allowed us to provide a more accurate and up-to-date picture of how depression at different life stages is linked to dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e5d565f4c52514a4a5b10495f52527e50514a4a575059565f53105f5d104b55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Jacob Brain et al. &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention, a global health concern. Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3) or critically low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 901,762 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 2,501,269 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68–2.26; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12–2.18; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Research, UK Research and Innovation, and Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9qYmcwcmxSUl9zajQ5cXBTemJEYm9QOVZHM1RCSU9VZ1N1YUVER21lQm5UaEZ1SXd3WllNbVFEb3lSczJHaEE1Y1ozbEZMTWpfTFpicDA4OHA0NHdkV1E1SHlLWWlneWtDeDZBVVIyQjhBZTJySkRZ</guid></item><item><title>7件意想不到的物品急诊室医生总是去度假- HuffPost | 7 Unexpected Items ER Doctors Always Take On Vacation - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZHhvZEZkTVQ5MjRkNVlCU0x4ZVhpZEx6UGV5aGxieklZcVlVUGlDVDg5RlpVSDA3Zng2aDN3RHR6MzlVWG9JYkNVUnJnR1k0STZVc0ZBbVItcVpUakRaaTFxM1ZmLWFVYUVVcmUwTVh4STRIRnEzMkY4STJxRzhHTHVkWkYxbWl5VVhrU201WTB6ZC1lN3VUUFRjejM5WEhnZlRB0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9seV94Tk9UbVh5eEhPZmZVZENYWWt3bk0wZjRhU1ZoajhrUHlSSWhoVDBuZTdEWThjSHZIWHUyUXBNYWhzeVRvVWpoVmNJNHlVb1dodVFlVUhpMmZaQTBacERxYWRqQVlWdEE4eE5fYldEQXNhQkhpR0ZnWFRrcVpzYlRfZlJ5LXpuOG5QOWFzUU90cjVJeFFyeWF5UmlsdzIzSDlfYVp6Yg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting sick on vacation happens more than most people realize: nearly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/vacation-sick-hurt-survey" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="30% " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.valuepenguin.com/vacation-sick-hurt-survey" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;of Americans say they’ve gotten sick or injured on a trip, throwing their travel plans for a loop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s only so much you can do to lower the risk of getting sick on vacation, emergency room doctors say it’s important to be prepared for certain situations. “You don’t want to ruin a great vacation with some type of bad event that happens to you,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/eric-adkins-md-29826" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric Adkins" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/eric-adkins-md-29826" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Eric Adkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an emergency medicine physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Sometimes you can prepare for simpler events.

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that’s odorless and colorless, and it’s produced when fuels like gasoline, oil, charcoal and natural gas burn incompletely, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-carbon-monoxide" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-carbon-monoxide" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (EPA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In low concentrations, carbon monoxide can cause fatigue and chest pain; In high concentrations, it can cause flu-like symptoms and even be deadly. Because the gas is odorless and colorless, it can be hard to know if you’re being exposed without a carbon monoxide detector.

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that sucralose increases activity in the hypothalamus—a key brain region involved in appetite regulation—compared to caloric sugar (sucrose) and water. The findings suggest that even though sucralose lacks calories, it can trigger neural responses linked to increased hunger and alter the way the brain communicates with areas involved in motivation and sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sucralose is a popular sugar substitute used in many diet sodas, baked goods, and low-calorie snacks. It provides a sweet taste without adding calories, which makes it attractive for people trying to lose weight or control blood sugar. However, while it may reduce calorie intake in the short term, its effects on appetite and metabolism are not fully understood. Some researchers have speculated that sucralose might confuse the brain’s hunger-regulating circuits by delivering sweetness without the expected nutrients that usually follow sugar intake. This mismatch may disrupt normal appetite control and possibly promote overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these effects, researchers at the University of Southern California conducted a randomized crossover trial involving 75 young adults between the ages of 18 and 35. The participants included individuals with healthy weight, overweight, and obesity. Each participant attended three separate sessions during which they consumed one of three drinks: a sucralose-sweetened beverage, a sucrose-sweetened beverage with the same level of sweetness, or water as a control. The sessions were spaced at least two days apart, and the order of drinks was randomized and blinded to both participants and experimenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after each drink, the researchers used functional MRI to measure blood flow in the hypothalamus and assess brain activity. Increases in hypothalamic blood flow are associated with hunger, while reductions typically occur after eating and are linked to satiety. In addition to brain imaging, researchers collected blood samples to measure glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 (a hormone involved in satiety), and they asked participants to rate their hunger at multiple time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that consuming sucralose, compared to sucrose and water, increased blood flow in the lateral hypothalamus. This region is known to be involved in triggering hunger and motivating food-seeking behavior. Notably, sucralose consumption also increased self-reported hunger levels compared to sucrose, despite containing no calories. In contrast, sucrose consumption led to increases in blood glucose and decreases in medial hypothalamic blood flow—responses typically associated with feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging also revealed that sucralose altered the functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and other brain regions. For example, after drinking sucralose, participants showed stronger connections between the hypothalamus and areas involved in motivation (like the anterior cingulate cortex) and body awareness (such as the parietal lobule). These changes suggest that sucralose may heighten the brain’s responsiveness to food cues or amplify motivational signals related to eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the effects of sucralose varied by body weight and sex. Among participants with healthy weight, sucralose triggered greater hypothalamic activation compared to sucrose, while individuals with obesity showed stronger responses to sucralose compared to water. Those who were overweight fell somewhere in between. Additionally, women showed stronger brain responses to sucralose than men, consistent with previous research suggesting sex differences in sensitivity to food cues and sweet taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sucrose drink caused measurable increases in glucose, insulin, and GLP-1, sucralose did not. Importantly, the drop in medial hypothalamic blood flow after sucrose ingestion was associated with increased glucose levels and reduced hunger, reinforcing the idea that nutrient signals—especially glucose—help suppress appetite via hypothalamic pathways. These relationships were not seen after sucralose consumption, which did not raise glucose or suppress hypothalamic activity in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored how individual differences in insulin sensitivity affected brain responses. Participants with lower insulin sensitivity, a marker of metabolic dysfunction, showed greater hypothalamic responses to sucralose than those with higher insulin sensitivity. This finding suggests that people with impaired metabolic function may be more sensitive to the appetite-related effects of non-caloric sweeteners, although more research is needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study highlights a paradox: sucralose does not provide calories, but it can stimulate the brain in ways that resemble hunger. The sweet taste, uncoupled from the expected metabolic signals that typically accompany caloric intake, appears to disrupt normal appetite signaling in the hypothalamus. Over time, this could potentially lead to increased food consumption or altered eating patterns, although the study only examined short-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kathleen Alanna Page, the study’s senior author and director of the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, these findings raise new questions about the widespread use of artificial sweeteners. “Are these substances actually helpful for regulating body weight? What happens in the body and brain when we consume them, and do the effects differ from one person to the next?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides evidence about how sucralose affects the brain, it also has some limitations. The researchers focused on short-term responses to single doses of sucralose under controlled conditions. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether repeated exposure to non-caloric sweeteners leads to sustained changes in appetite, eating behavior, or body weight. In addition, although the study matched drinks for sweetness intensity, it did not measure participants’ subjective experience of sweet taste or their preferences, which could influence brain responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that their participant group consisted of young, healthy adults who were not trying to lose weight. Results might differ in older adults, individuals with diabetes, or those actively managing their weight. The study also focused only on sucralose, leaving open the question of whether other sweeteners—such as aspartame, saccharin, or stevia—have similar or different effects on the brain and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address some of these gaps, Page and her team have launched a follow-up study examining how non-caloric sweeteners affect brain development and appetite regulation in children and adolescents, who are among the heaviest consumers of sugar substitutes. “The brain is vulnerable during this time,” Page explained, “so it could be a critical opportunity to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;Non-caloric sweetener effects on brain appetite regulation in individuals across varying body weights&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sandhya P.

And more than two children were affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate but simultaneous investigations revealed that the variant, found in a gene called TP53, was present in 23 total children, 10 of whom had already been diagnosed with leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though 10 kids have been diagnosed thus far, the company also confirmed that the donor’s sperm was used to conceive many more children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Sperm Bank — which recruits sperm donors in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, according to its &lt;a href="https://www.europeanspermbank.com/en/getting-started/about-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; — said that more than 67 kids were conceived using the donor’s sperm, and that all relevant fertility clinics were alerted to the situation. (It did not, however, confirm the exact number, citing a company privacy policy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Sperm Bank did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Sunday, May 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A stock image of frozen storage at a sperm bank&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company, Julie Paulli Budtz, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; the company is “deeply affected by this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budtz also said that, even with thorough testing prior to sperm donation, “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if testing had unearthed the mutation, it was not yet linked to cancer in 2008 (the time of the donation) and would not have been detectable through standard screening procedures, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported. The outlet also said the donor is in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the recent diagnoses linked to a single donor, however, Kasper argues that there should be a limit on the number of births or families for a single donor instated across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, the biologist said: “We can’t do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors — I’m not arguing for that. But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure is a reference to European Sperm Bank’s self-imposed limit. Reacting to calls for a limit placed on the number of children conceived with the sperm of a single donor, Budtz told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,” Budtz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/10-kids-conceived-with-same-sperm-donor-develop-cancer-11741613" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 11:39:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBTcTZHOFBFSHRUN2RFeXVhcVJnMF85T0RhVEEwekdKV3RlZ3d3MUg5dGF3YWVWeGV5WEoyNlljU3FabnBZYlg4NmhRWkt3ODF1eUJJMlRRaWV6WXdBLTBxS0ZjY3NPV2pLMDNqcWJYYUllOXNmYnc</guid></item><item><title>女性健康的新时代：尊重你的身体，坚不可摧- MindBodyGreen | New Era Of Women’s Health: Honoring Your Body &amp; Becoming Unbreakable - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOV1hHRDNaeGZ3WHRFTmU3ZTJrSUlCVWdrcUJSOWZGMUdoeFNPMTlpaFNVUkhqb3dILXV6QlZPNjRVU3V0bERsVVM2NWtBTUtaNjU5YUdiVmJRZUUtcWhLS21Idi01eUYxSERZQTRHT0VQb0s1cl9fbnpULUw0RG1YUldQQWRMSnFKdEl4WHl3Nmw4Nk42RzdNYmNYVzA1Wm5rek9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s health in 2025 isn’t about shrinking, restricting, or overtraining.

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that he was rescinding the federal government’s recommendation that pregnant women and healthy children get immunized against COVID, effective immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also said the agency will no longer routinely approve annually formulated COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy people under age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We simply don’t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had COVID-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,” Makary, along with another FDA official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in the New England Journal of Medicine this month. “This policy will compel much-needed evidence generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some experts say mandating more extensive testing could delay vaccine access for many, as those efforts may not even be complete until after the end of the upcoming winter flu-and-COVID season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that, in general, getting an updated vaccine provides children and adults &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?t=5503s" target="_blank"&gt;additional protection&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-related emergency room and urgent care visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent federal changes, according to some experts, could also prompt private insurance companies and government insurers to stop paying for COVID shots for wide segments of the population, including babies and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent a recommendation by federal officials, Americans could end up paying the entire cost of a vaccine, experts say. The out-of-pocket cost for a COVID vaccine at CVS, for instance, is $198.99. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/do-not-post-californias-covid-emergency-is-over-now-what"&gt;emergency phase of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has long since passed, authorities note COVID remains a public health concern. A relatively new subvariant has been spreading in Europe and Asia, “particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan, other countries, Japan, etc.,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That subvariant, NB.1.8.1, was first documented in January and has since been detected in California, including in Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area. The World Health Organization &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/variants?n=o" target="_blank"&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt; it a “Variant Under Monitoring” last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has grown exponentially worldwide in recent weeks. The Omicron subvariant represented 10.7% of genetically analyzed viral samples worldwide for the week ending April 27, WHO data show. That was up sharply from the week ending April 6, when the subvariant &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=7b14df58_4" target="_blank"&gt;accounted for&lt;/a&gt; 2.5% of samples worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While still low numbers, this is a significant rise,” the WHO said, adding that there was a “concurrent increase in cases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 isn’t yet prevalent enough in the United States to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank"&gt;publicly tracked&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC. Another strain, LP.8.1,  accounted for an estimated 73% of coronavirus specimens nationally for the two-week period ending Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data suggest NB.1.8.1 does not cause more severe illness, “but it is more transmissible, at least from what we’re seeing around the world and also from lab experiments,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease expert at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, a top health official told reporters that an NB.1.8.1-fueled outbreak was “continuing to rise rapidly, with a sustained increase in severe and fatal cases,” the Central News Agency &lt;a class="link" href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202505270017" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a shortage of COVID testing kits. Health officials said a factor in Taiwan’s surge was the lack of a major COVID wave over the winter, and forecast that the island’s current spike may not peak for another four to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has seen increased prevalence in each of the three WHO regions that still consistently share genetic analysis of COVID samples — the Western Pacific (which includes East Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, and Australia); Europe; and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID tests are coming back positive in Los Angeles County has slightly increased over the past few weeks, although the overall positive rate remains low, at 3.5%, according to the county Department of Public Health. Coronavirus levels detected in the county’s wastewater have increased by 6% in the last three weeks, but also remain relatively low and are about one-eighth of the peak in the summer of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although California experienced a mild winter season — a first of the COVID era — that followed a powerful &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;summer spike&lt;/a&gt; that was the strongest in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts and officials have touted available COVID vaccines as effective both in warding off infection and in lessening the severity of symptoms. However, the need for otherwise healthy individuals to roll up their sleeves has been a matter of debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;video message&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday on X, Kennedy — a noted vaccine skeptic — said that he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said they could not recall a time when a political appointee circumvented a well-established process of making vaccine recommendations, which typically involves panels of scientists advising the FDA and CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of chilling,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s out of step with the system we’ve learned to trust and follow.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to The Times, the L.A. County Department of Public Health urged Kennedy to listen to experts in the field — including from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is scheduled to meet next month — “before decreasing access to any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the CDC still had the long-standing vaccine recommendations on its website:  Everyone ages 6 months and older should get the most recent COVID-19 vaccine, officially known as the 2024-25 version, which was introduced in September. The CDC also recommends seniors ages 65 and up get a second vaccine dose six months after their first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the California Department of Public Health said that it supports the current expansive recommendation for COVID vaccines, and that it “will continue to follow the federal conversation through this dynamic situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination can reduce the risk of disease, especially more severe cases that result in hospitalization or death,” the department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr-covid/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that the CDC did not know of Kennedy’s directive until he posted it, and officials have been “scrambling to find out what it meant.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who spoke with The Times warned the practical effect of the edict — if it becomes official — could be far more costly vaccines for affected groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If vaccines are not recommended by the CDC, insurance companies would NOT be required to cover the cost,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the vaccines may be less accessible to healthier people who still want them — perhaps because they live or work with elderly or other higher-risk people, they’ve had severe COVID illness before, or they want to protect themselves against the latest subvariant, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the FDA withholds a license for an updated COVID vaccination for younger, healthier adults, this group “would not be able to receive it unless their provider chooses to give it ‘off label,’” the county said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether healthy pregnant women and healthy children can still get vaccinated at its pharmacies, Walgreens said its teams operate “in full compliance with applicable laws.” CVS said its locations “follow federal guidance regarding vaccine administration and are monitoring any changes that the government may make regarding vaccine eligibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente Southern California said it was aware of potential changes, but noted no new formal guidance has yet been issued. As a result, Kaiser is continuing to follow existing guidance, which recommends the shots for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health said that as of Wednesday, “pregnant women and healthy children can get vaccinated for COVID-19,” according to existing  recommendations from an advisory panel and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted there were 150 pediatric deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 in a recent one-year period. That’s in the same ballpark as the 231 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-20.html" target="_blank"&gt;pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; recorded this season, and federal health officials recommend everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people would agree that kids should be targeted for flu vaccines. It seems kind of weird to have COVID as an outlier in that respect,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video published this week, Makary said that “most countries in the world have stopped recommending the vaccine for children.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldonado, however, said the U.S. doesn’t use other nations’ standards to dictate vaccine recommendations. The U.S., for instance, recommends other types of vaccines that have a lower prevalence than COVID that people want to get, Maldonado said, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;meningococcal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for children to guard against a serious &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bacterial disease&lt;/a&gt; that can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause death within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of a recommendation also varies by country. Canada, for instance, recommends updated COVID vaccines for seniors and other people who meet certain criteria, such as if they’re pregnant or are a healthcare worker. But the country’s universal healthcare system still allows everyone ages 6 months and older to get an updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s true that children overall are at lower risk of developing severe COVID illness, those under 6 months of age “have the same risk of complications as the 65-year-old-plus population in this country,” said Stanford’s Maldonado, who also serves on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children eligible for vaccination, COVID-associated hospitalization rates are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/03-Havers-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; for those ages 6 months to 4 years, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So are children going to be the highest risk group? No, they’re not. But would you want to protect your child from a disease that could potentially put them in the hospital and get them on a ventilator? Yes, I would say that I would want to make that choice for myself. And why not allow the parent to make that choice?” Maldonado said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says COVID vaccination during pregnancy builds antibodies that can help protect the baby; studies have also shown that vaccinated moms who breastfeed have protective  antibodies in their milk, which could help protect their babies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been an estimated 260,000 to 430,000 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; attributed to COVID since October, causing “an enormous burden on the healthcare system,” Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=4113" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a recent public meeting. There have also been an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 COVID-19 deaths over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults, but it does affect other people, particularly those with underlying conditions, in younger age groups.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations, even among otherwise healthy children, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a summer wave this year, we’ll be seeing it in children being hospitalized with COVID as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOdXpTaGVINk01eEdSMGF2R1pUaWlqeTRPcXBrQ1h5MUlEdmlBWHlYRTA5MW5jSk4zV3F0TW1uWm91eVVvcUR5QmdvcTE3ZWEzVllha0VENkF6TFVuWmo5Zy00eHRJOEFFQ1k2aUVudWZ2Ukp1aTJMam8zOFdrSjBGVC1uZHBxVmFmdEdiZ2xwRUotc3Q5Z1RJVnE0QnRRWk5ZT1djeF9VcWNYYXQwelpCUEYtTkcxZVRsVDBWV2FZUVRSOFE</guid></item><item><title>为什么爬楼梯对身体和大脑都有好处- BBC | Why climbing the stairs can be good for your body and brain - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQTl9XXzFoeXRETlY3QWJxcjBsNnp2OXVmRjh3eVBhdS12UWYwSDluRzg1WFk0bG1zNllqaWw1NlJvMFNISHhWV19xS21YYlpVb1o1SFpXcDVvVUtneVZRSmRIelZ0QzZOMk1lUlMxSHlFeWZPVThQQUE1TXlLUTlhUWtKTXNvSzVoMVQ1eXpHSndIUGctOVBWZG1QYktPd05hT2hJTU5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Why climbing the stairs can be good for your body and brain&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Alamy Close up of a person's feet wearing sandals as they climb a staircase painted red next to a green wall (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="while-it-is-tempting-to-take-the-lift-or-escalator-rather-than-use-the-stairs,-even-scaling-just-a-few-flights-a-day-could-give-your-health-and-mind-a-boost." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;While it is tempting to take the lift or escalator rather than use the stairs, even scaling just a few flights a day could give your health and mind a boost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As expeditions go, it was a gruelling one.

And he did it all in the relative comfort of his own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Greasley &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/10/mans-mission-to-raise-charity-cash-by-climbing-everest-at-home" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;holds the world record&lt;/a&gt; for the fastest time to ascend and descend the same height as Mount Everest on stairs, achieving it in 22 hours, 57 minutes and two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While Greasley achieved this on the staircase at his home in Las Vegas, there are others who take stair climbing to other extremes. Tower running, for example, involves racing up enormous flights of stairs inside iconic buildings and skyscrapers. There is even a Tower Running Association and an official tower running &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.towerrunning.com/ranking/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;global ranking&lt;/a&gt; for the elite athletes dedicated to this unusual sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most of us are unlikely to achieve such giddy heights, yet even climbing a few flights of stairs in our daily lives might be something to aspire to. According to research, climbing stairs can have surprising benefits for both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915023052218" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your physical health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your brain&lt;/a&gt; without needing to hurtle up two steps at a time or break records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's this everyday simplicity that is stair-climbing's greatest strength. Stairs are everywhere – we encounter them at home, at work and in public. Choosing to take the stairs instead of hopping on an escalator or riding in a lift provides us with an incidental form of exercise that can have an outsized impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's an exercise that nearly everybody can perform because they have access, and they do it on the daily basis," says Alexis Marcotte-Chenard, a postdoctoral research fellow in heart, lung and vascular health at the University of British Columbia in Kelowna, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Marcotte-Chenard has been researching how to use exercise and nutrition to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including the effects of "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34669625/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/a&gt;" – brief, spaced-out periods of vigorous activity lasting one minute or less that are performed throughout the day.

Researchers have found that stair-climbing results in surprising improvements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Andreas Stenling is an associate professor psychology at Umeå University, Sweden, who primarily researches the longer-term relationships between physical activity and health. He and his colleagues studied the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1#Sec17" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;immediate effects&lt;/a&gt; of stair-climbing on different cognitive abilities in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inhibition and switching were the two main cognitive functions we focused on here," says Stenling, "Cognitive switching, sometimes called mental flexibility, is how easy we're able to switch between cognitive tasks," he says. "So, going from one task to the other without having to reset your cognition, so to speak. Inhibition is about blocking out irrelevant information while you're engaged in the task." Stenling explains that we know that these cognitive functions are important for learning, cognitive word tasks, abstract thinking, and being able to keep your thoughts on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Climbing more than five flights of stairs daily  is associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Stenling and colleagues found that their stair-climbing exercise significantly improved participants' "switching" abilities, which is also considered the most difficult of the cognitive tasks tested for. They also tested for changes in mood, finding that participants felt happier and more energetic after stair-climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another study published by researchers at the Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Japan also found that people who climbed two flights of stairs displayed&lt;/a&gt; more focused problem solving than those who took the elevator. Intriguingly, there weren't any improvements in problem solving when they climbed five or eight flights of stairs, suggesting the effect is not dependent upon the number of stairs. Another study by the same group also found that walking downstairs led to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.834097/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;increase in creative thinking&lt;/a&gt;, generating 61% more original ideas than those who travelled using a lift. So if you are looking for a burst of inspiration on a problem you are trying to solve, a quick jaunt up to the next floor and back may be all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is much interest in the mechanisms which link exercise to cognitive benefits, but little conclusive research. Stenling suggests, however, that the improvements could be linked to the cardiovascular system and the increase in blood flow to the brain, as well as growth hormones such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/15092" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor&lt;/a&gt; (BDNF), which seem to be impacted quickly by exercise in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers including Stenling are also keen to explore whether there may be any delayed effects from stair climbing. Most studies focus on the cognitive effects immediately after climbing some stairs. One recent study found, however, that there were &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01683-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some improvements in memory&lt;/a&gt; from stair-climbing that carry over to the next day when paired with good sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But while the concept of taking 10,000 steps a day is ingrained in the public mind as the benchmark for daily exercise, is there a similar target we should be aiming for when it comes to stairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research is similarly sparse when it comes to putting a target on stair climbing. But the studies that do exist suggest that climbing more than five flights of stairs daily (equivalent to 50 steps) is associated with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(23)05221-8/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is the build-up of plaque in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Marcotte-Chenard and his colleagues are optimistic that exercise snacks, specifically stair-climbing, could provide a good solution to breaking sedimentary habits at work. In a study assessing the psychological responses of office employees undertaking stair-climbing in the workplace, Marcotte-Chenard and colleagues found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37748202/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;71% of employees&lt;/a&gt; preferred several small exercise snacks, climbing 60 steps in three different sessions, over one intense HIIT (high intensity interval training) session of climbing 60 steps three times in one session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For them [the participants], it's easier to just go one time up and down the stairs and go back to sitting," says Marcotte-Chenard. "And because you spread it out throughout the day, it seems that people enjoy it a little bit more than if they do it in one single session." The researchers' study is unique for being conducted outside the laboratory, which could suggest that the research is more applicable to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not all research agrees that home stair-climbing is the answer, with some suggesting it is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.12679" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;insufficient physical&lt;/a&gt; activity to lower the risk of CVD mortality and premature death.

Although the weather in Milwaukie, Ore., was cold and rainy that March evening, his apartment was too warm to explain his chills. He had been having abdominal pain for the past several weeks, but that night it was excruciating — like a knife plunged deep into his belly, sharp and burning. All the strength seemed to seep from his body, and he thought he might pass out. That’s when he asked his roommate to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The E.M.T.s were concerned by the man’s pallor and low blood pressure and took him to Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside in Clackamas, just north of the small town where he spent much of his childhood. In the E.R., initial blood tests showed that he had lost a tremendous amount of blood — nearly half the blood in his system. The man shook with cold beneath the several blankets layered over him. With trembling hands, he signed the consent forms for a transfusion to replace some of what he had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-72d7d2a"&gt;Months of Bizarre Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It had been a strange winter. In January, he noticed a bulge in the left side of his abdomen while taking a shower. He pressed on it, and it disappeared, only to reappear when the pressure was released. It didn’t hurt, but it was weird and new. He got in to see a physician assistant 10 days later. The P.A. couldn’t see or feel the lump but ordered an ultrasound to look for it. And they found it: a mass the size of a large grapefruit, about six inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Three weeks later, before any follow-ups had been planned, the man was sent a Valentine’s Day lunch by his girlfriend. He had just started eating when he developed a stabbing pain in his abdomen. It lasted less than a minute. But every mouthful after that moment triggered the same searing pain — even water. He drove himself to a nearby urgent care center. A CT scan showed clearly that the grapefruit of fluid now filled his entire upper abdomen, compressing his stomach, pancreas and spleen. He was admitted to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Before Dr. Amit Sadana, the gastroenterologist assigned to his care, met the patient the following day, he had already reviewed the images showing the mass. It was probably digestive enzymes leaking from the pancreas into the abdomen. The man’s body had responded by walling off the fluid with inflammatory cells, forming what is called a pseudocyst. This was usually seen after trauma — often a serious car accident in which the seatbelt was slammed against the abdomen. The man recalled an accidental hit sustained while wrestling in the snow with a friend a couple of months earlier. Sadana looked dubious — it usually took more force than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In any case, the doctor said, he could put a tube into the pseudocyst and let the fluid flow into the man’s stomach. That would reduce the pressure and allow the inflammatory mass to resolve. That was done the next day, and for the first time in weeks, the young man was able to eat and drink with no pain. He was sent home a day later; the plan was to let the fluid drain for three or four weeks and then remove the tube. Sadana sent the fluid to the lab to see if there was something else going on. The results showed no evidence of cancer. Pancreatic cancer is rare in someone this young, but it could cause a leak of pancreatic fluid. And it’s not a diagnosis you want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pair of French scientists are exploring the impact of ionizing radiation on pollinators. Their research has taken them to Fukushima, Japan, site of the infamous 2011 nuclear disaster, to investigate how radioactivity might affect the cognitive abilities of these insects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Drives This Research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it’s important to recognize that pollinators like bees and hornets possess &lt;strong&gt;numerous cognitive abilities&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling them, for example, to navigate space or recognize colors. However, we know that environmental pollution and other human-made substances can disrupt the cognition of these insects. So, what about radioactivity? This topic was explored in an article published by CNRS Le Journal on May 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine spoke with Olivier Armant from the Ecology and Ecotoxicology of Radionuclides lab at the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist at the Animal Cognition Research Center (CRCA) of the Toulouse Integrative Biology Center (CBI). Armant is investigating the &lt;strong&gt;ecological effects of ionizing rays&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly on the wildlife and plant life in the contaminated Fukushima area in Japan. Lihoreau, on the other hand, is deeply interested in bee intelligence and the factors that could impair it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two researchers are now collaborating with Japan, using a system developed with the Toulouse-based startup BeeGuard (described below). This involves a concept of a connected hive that allows for &lt;strong&gt;real-time monitoring of the biological activity&lt;/strong&gt; of certain bee species in a radioactive environment. For the scientists, these studies could shed light on bees’ learning and memory capacities and could also be &lt;strong&gt;valuable in ecotoxicology&lt;/strong&gt;. According to Mathieu Lihoreau, &lt;em&gt;“if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain areas, it indicates a problem.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Findings Are Not Encouraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that &lt;strong&gt;radioactive residues present in nectar&lt;/strong&gt; could impair bees’ cognitive abilities. For instance, the insects might be unable to associate a reward with a color (or scent). Consequently, they might visit flowers of various species instead of focusing on one, thus failing to deliver the correct pollen to the appropriate plants. Over the long term, this could jeopardize the survival of the colonies and, more broadly, the &lt;strong&gt;pollination service crucial to the balance of ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;. While this remains a hypothesis, similar conclusions exist concerning certain pesticide-laden areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several tests in the Toulouse region, the connected hive was deployed in Fukushima’s contaminated zone as part of &lt;strong&gt;two field operations in 2023 and 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. The sites were selected based on the soil contamination levels with cesium 137, and local hornets were also included in the cognition study. In the hive, there’s a Y-shaped maze with two paths lit by LEDs of different colors. However, only one of the colors leads to a reward, namely sweet water. According to experts, a healthy bee &lt;strong&gt;needs about ten attempts&lt;/strong&gt; to find the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the study’s results have not yet been published in a scientific journal, the two French researchers are already concerned. Indeed, they have reported &lt;strong&gt;a decline in cognitive performance&lt;/strong&gt; in Fukushima’s contaminated zone. However, although correlations exist, there’s currently no proof of a causal link involving radioactive contamination. Moreover, since the area is now uninhabited, this decline in cognition cannot be attributed to the presence of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It seems like everyone is pushing it these days. It's true that our bodies need protein to function, but how much is really necessary and is it possible to go overboard? We asked a doctor and a registered dietitian for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, protein is a chain of amino acids that every cell in your body needs to do its job. “&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is the main building block for our body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/zhaoping-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition and the chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of protein are seemingly endless. “&lt;strong&gt;Your body uses protein to repair and build muscle tissue, and it's also part of the structure of your bones, cartilage, skin and blood&lt;/strong&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert, the founder of Sam’s Plate and co-author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Shock-Hidden-Smart-Swaps/dp/1950785009/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64853473%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sugar Shock;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “It also helps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120303119" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:produce immune cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;produce immune cells&lt;/a&gt; that fight infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, carbohydrates and fats are &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a37305530/macronutrients-and-micronutrients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the three macronutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the three macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; our bodies depend on. However, unlike carbohydrates and fats, protein is not stored in the body, notes Dr. Li. “We have limited protein reserve for a few hours to support our organ system metabolism,” she says. That means we have to eat protein every day to ensure our body has what it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein do we need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gets a little tricky because there’s not a one-size-fits-all number,” says Cassetty. The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends that women consume 5 to 6.5 ounces of protein foods every day, while men eat 5.5 to 7 ounces daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A general rule of thumb is to eat.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight every day.&lt;/strong&gt; (That would be about 54 grams for a 150-pound woman.) “Most Americans meet that, but that recommendation is based on the minimum amount needed to prevent deficiency and maintain basic functions — not necessarily the optimal amount to thrive,” says Cassetty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most experts agree that a higher intake — around 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (that's 82-136 grams for a 150-pound woman)— may be better&lt;/strong&gt; for maintaining muscle mass, managing weight and supporting healthy aging,” Cassetty explains. “Your exact needs depend on things like your age, activity level and goals, but most people would benefit from getting a bit more than the bare minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat too much protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an upper limit, especially for folks with abnormal kidney function,” says Dr. Li. “But it is generally safe for healthy individuals.” In fact, she says, certain groups of people such as those who have an acute illness, are athletes or are elderly may need more than the general recommendations. &lt;strong&gt;To figure out the ideal amounts for your body, “it is important to see a &lt;a href="https://nbpns.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physician Nutrition Specialist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physician Nutrition Specialist&lt;/a&gt; or/and &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:registered dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;registered dietitian&lt;/a&gt;,”&lt;/strong&gt; adds Dr. Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, maintaining a balanced diet is key, even if you’re on a quest for more protein. “I often see people loading up on protein in ways that crowd out other essential nutrients — especially fiber from plant foods,” says Cassetty. “While protein has many benefits, it’s just one piece of a balanced diet. More than &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:90% of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;90% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; fall short on fiber, so it’s important to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best sources of protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassetty recommends starting with whole foods before reaching for highly processed protein bars and shakes. “You can get it from both animal and plant sources like chicken, fish, eggs, tofu and pulses (such as beans and lentils),” she says. “Some of my go-to easy options include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, canned or pouched tuna and salmon, steamed lentils, frozen edamame and canned chickpeas. Frozen shrimp is great, too — it defrosts quickly and cooks fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pinch, she says foods like &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/g28089471/best-protein-powder/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein powder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;, frozen veggie burgers, canned lentil soup and edamame or chickpea pasta can provide protein, but it’s best not to make them everyday staples. “All foods can fit, but they don’t fit equally,” says Cassetty. “Prioritizing whole food sources of protein is a better way to go for your long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOSWJVNFhnTGRWSmZIZzU2eVR1N2NjTUViYkJVZ3FraFBVcjZfMWFWV25VQ1FreWdLODIyaXdIY1FidVhoal9tT3RtX0pmYUpfenZLVUpXNUNFWHZqaG5EOW5VOHd6TUpKU0xoSTVsTEc2Z2pWS3BQa1AxRzM5cTNYNzBtOUFRSE9N</guid></item><item><title>专家精确指出对您的健康最关键的十年......当伤害无法挽回时-每日邮报 | Experts pinpoint the most critical decade for your health... when damage can't be undone - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOWEZVT1NrOVNNOEZOQWI4TzVZSExiajQ1SFcxUWRVZUllbVZBUXRDQ1Q0bW1vYjFQWXJWYWpSRzJhc0pzV2RyeTcxTmRBNU00MUJZMURETjRDQmN5SWRwQjRJQ2Yxc3NIM3BxWkFCcGRoZERYWFFlLUVGM0RxVDh5MUtxbmpHaGZlVEMzclo4dFh0ZGRJU0VfWXJMcmctNWVvUzlpNTlQdWJkSDNYWVFv0gG0AUFVX3lxTE5wODBMd3R3UElQVTRWNkp4ZHJqU0otdzIwblhKMmRCTC13MUNsMTNqWkhUT1hlRHc1akpnZzBFLW1EMGJCWnRJdjZTQ01GbVRlRkNBYmdrdmpTNWRPYnVnZ0ZTWm9YQnRCR0xaMFpZbVJHTGxUWE1HOGYzMG1pTDFrN0hMdW5GdmYtRDRYUm04OGdOZDdwSHUxbExhYV9VelZ4Ri0zeXpXQXQ2MGo5alRUdmdLSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the most important decade for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking, drinking, and being inactive &lt;span&gt;become entrenched in the decade between 36 and 46 and are harder to reverse, according to a new study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year a person continues an unhealthy habit, the damage is compounded, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These habits gradually erode a person's metabolic and psychological health until they become part of a person's biology after 46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study out of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-ef39fe90-3cc3-11f0-adc7-311d266abbd3"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; showed that when a person reaches 30, each additional decade of risky behavior worsened their health through age 50 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Even a single risky behaviour increases the risk of premature death and diseases, but together with other health behaviours, the impact is cumulative,’ the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Furthermore, the impact of these behaviours on health accumulates throughout a lifetime.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoked, drank, and were physically inactive through their 20s saw few negative effects then, but those behaviors caught up with them, causing &lt;span&gt;worse mental health, poorer self-rated health, and doubled metabolic risks such as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992723/Half-Americans-silent-killer-condition-CDC-warns.html"&gt; high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, obesity, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-ef32d2a0-3cc3-11f0-adc7-311d266abbd3" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by age their late-30s. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who start engaging in risky behaviors young, such as smoking, are more likely to experience depression and poorer physical health by middle and older age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finnish researchers gathered patient data from a study spanning 1968 to 2021 on 369 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists calculated people’s current risk scores based on how many risky behaviors they maintain currently, from zero behaviors (no risk) to three (the highest risk, i.e., smoking, drinking, and being physically inactive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 36-year-old who smokes and drinks but also exercises would receive a two, while a 50-year-old who quit smoking but still drinks and doesn’t exercise would get a score of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked beyond what behaviors a person has now. They looked at how many years a person maintained those harmful habits, known as the temporal risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People were told to count how many times they did each behavior at each age checkpoint – 27, 36, 42, 50, 61. Someone who smoked at 27, 36, and 42 but quit at 50, therefore, earned a temporal smoking score of three out of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded that people who currently have those risky behaviors had more depressive symptoms based on a scored 16-item questionnaire, higher metabolic risks measured by markers like high blood pressure, large waist, and low ‘good’ HDL cholesterol, lower psychological well-being based on a scored 18-question test, and worse self-rated health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had those behaviors now, as well as in decades previously, were even worse off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who started smoking in their 20s and early 30s, as opposed to those who started in their 40s, were more than twice as likely to exhibit depression symptoms and psychological well-being scores that were 2.3 times worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Similarly, people with metabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure early in life were twice as likely to experience chronic metabolic disorders compared to those who began experiencing those risk factors in middle age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, people with metabolic risk factors early in life were twice as likely to experience chronic metabolic disorders compared to those who began experiencing those risk factors in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Self-rated health among those with worse physical health early in life saw double the decline in self-rated health versus those who became more inactive in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: ‘Interestingly, the temporal accumulation of risky health behaviours was particularly associated with depressive symptoms in the present study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results suggest that the accumulation of risky health behaviours over time may also be one of the important factors when preventing depressive symptoms and depression.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233#abstract"&gt; Annals of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; had several notable limitations, though. They could not establish that risky behaviors caused poor health, only that they are linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also looked at a few risky behaviors while not considering several others, such as diet, sleep, or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that the subjects were Finnish adults born in 1959, a population that may not reflect the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People may have also reported their health and habits through a rosier lens, concealing heavy drinking, misremembering bad habits, or not opening up about depressive symptoms, risking bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They concluded that people who currently have those risky behaviors had more depressive symptoms based on a scored 16-item questionnaire in their 40s to 60s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the study’s 30-year longitudinal design and inclusion of several health outcomes, both physical and mental, provide rare and valuable insights into the effects of lifelong habits and whether humans can undo some of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is tied to a laundry list of health problems, ranging from myriad cancers to chronic lung and breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking excessively is known to cause severe liver damage that can prove life-threatening. And obesity is a leading risk factor for a range of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health habits don't change much during middle adulthood, researchers said, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856347/Six-rules-living-chronic-pain-inspiring-vision-GRACE-QUANTOCK-spent-20-years-wheelchair-suffers-16-conditions.html"&gt;becoming chronic concerns&lt;/a&gt;. Their findings stressed the importance of ‘tackling risky health behaviours as early as possible’ to keep these risks from piling up over the years, ‘which can otherwise lead to poor mental well-being and health later in life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is steeped in an epidemic of chronic diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 133 million Americans – approximately 40 percent of the US population – have at least one chronic illness. Obesity is the most common among them. Forty-two percent of Americans have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have known for years that lifestyle choices and trauma early in life, particularly childhood, significantly impact one’s health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the latest study breaks new ground by revealing that it’s not just what you do, it’s when and for how long you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:41:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOWEZVT1NrOVNNOEZOQWI4TzVZSExiajQ1SFcxUWRVZUllbVZBUXRDQ1Q0bW1vYjFQWXJWYWpSRzJhc0pzV2RyeTcxTmRBNU00MUJZMURETjRDQmN5SWRwQjRJQ2Yxc3NIM3BxWkFCcGRoZERYWFFlLUVGM0RxVDh5MUtxbmpHaGZlVEMzclo4dFh0ZGRJU0VfWXJMcmctNWVvUzlpNTlQdWJkSDNYWVFv0gG0AUFVX3lxTE5wODBMd3R3UElQVTRWNkp4ZHJqU0otdzIwblhKMmRCTC13MUNsMTNqWkhUT1hlRHc1akpnZzBFLW1EMGJCWnRJdjZTQ01GbVRlRkNBYmdrdmpTNWRPYnVnZ0ZTWm9YQnRCR0xaMFpZbVJHTGxUWE1HOGYzMG1pTDFrN0hMdW5GdmYtRDRYUm04OGdOZDdwSHUxbExhYV9VelZ4Ri0zeXpXQXQ2MGo5alRUdmdLSQ</guid></item><item><title>首次与年轻人结肠癌相关的流行派对组合-每日邮报 | Popular party combo linked to colon cancer in young people for the first time - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol and cigarettes have been a mainstay pairing at parties for generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a major study warns the combination of drinking and smoking raise the risk one of America's fastest-growing cancers in under-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-7a530ef0-3c96-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; analyzed just over two dozen studies comparing regular drinkers and smokers to teetotalers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 100 cigarettes in a person's lifetime - the equivalent of one per week for two years - was linked to a 59 percent higher risk than people who have never smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found drinking &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b01ef0d0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; every day raised the risk of developing early-onset colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b01f3ef0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by 39 percent, even if it's just one or two drinks per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each can of beer or glass of wine per day further increased the chance by an additional&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;two percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13607563/Gen-Z-going-teetotal-parents-drinking-habits-alcohol-teetotal-health-young-adults.html"&gt;fewer millennials and Gen Zers drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; than ever before, which makes the findings difficult to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say alcohol and cigarettes are likely just one part of the problem, with diet, sedentary lifestyles, obesity and other factors likely also playing a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking and smoking is a classic party combo, but the latest research shows both may raise the risk of colon cancer in young people (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Alcohol consumption and smoking are significant risk factors for EOCRC and should be addressed in the context of prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol and smoking have both been linked to colon cancer in the past, as they release chemicals that destroy DNA and cause cancer cells to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the new study is one of the first to compare both factors at once in relatively low amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the new data shows a link between colon cancer and using alcohol and tobacco, it contradicts the recent decline of both habits in younger groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the 1960s, smoking rates in the US have fallen 73 percent in adults and 86 percent in children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millennials and Gen Z are also drinking less than their parents. The latest Gallup research shows 62 percent of adults under 35 drink alcohol compared to 72 percent in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, binge drinking - four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men - is also on the rise in Gen Z women. Research published last month in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt; found women ages 18 to 25 had higher rates of binge drinking than men in the same age group for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also shows even former smokers are at an increased risk of colon cancer up to 25 years after quitting due to long-term DNA damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review, published this week in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1533002825000519#cebibl1"&gt;Clinical Colorectal Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 12 studies on alcohol consumption and 13 on smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the team found daily alcohol consumption in general increased the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer 39 percent compared to lower amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at moderate alcohol consumption and high consumption. Moderate was considered one daily drink for women and two for men. High is four or more daily drinks for women and five or more for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found people who consumed moderate to high amounts of alcohol every day had a 30 percent greater risk of colon tumors and 34 percent greater risk of rectal tumors than those who consumed low amounts of alcohol per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strongest association they found was in a 2022 study published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/3582443"&gt;Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at colorectal cancer patients with a history of alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marisa Peters, a mother-of-three from California (pictured here), was diagnosed with stage three rectal cancer at age 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was a professional baseball player when he was stuck by stage three colon cancer at age 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to patients who never abused alcohol, those with a history of alcohol addiction were 90 percent more likely to develop colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers in the new review also found the risk of colon cancer increased 2.3 percent for every 10 grams per deciliter (g/d) of ethanol, pure alcohol, consumed per day. This is the equivalent of one standard drink per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, one standard drink is considered a 12-ounce can of beer with five percent alcohol volume, a five-ounce glass of wine at 12 percent alcohol volume or a 1.5-ounce shot glass of distilled spirits with 40 percent alcohol content, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team behind the new review wrote: 'These results clearly suggest that alcohol consumption is associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC at any age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe when the liver breaks down ethanol, it creates the toxic chemical acetaldehyde, which damages triggers inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damages DNA and leads to uncontrolled cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also inhibits the body's ability to absorb folate, an essential nutrient for DNA repair. Low folate has consistently been linked to higher colon cancer rates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also evaluated the effect of smoking on colon cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the researchers found a 39 percent increased risk of colorectal cancer in people who smoked cigarettes regularly compared to those who never smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ever smokers,' or people who have had at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, were at a 59 percent increased risk compared to non-smokers or former smokers while current smokers were at a 14 percent greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current smokers were shown to have a 43 percent greater likelihood of developing a rectal tumor than those who never smoked, and colon tumors were linked to a 26 percent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'The results on smoking showed a significant association of smoking with EOCRC, while former smoking was not associated with EOCRC.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking also exposes the body to thousands of carcinogens and free radicals that destroy healthy DNA and cause cells to mutate into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new review, including the small number of included studies and data on alcohol and smoking was self-reported, leaving it subject to bias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:38:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPTW9kRUR3MGJGNUpwd0J6dm1Mb3hSdnJhTHNvMW5na1JMUjhwTW01MlVhTUZxSHZaODU3VHZOUXJXbDNrTWJoczdzZllNRHBJdi1kemVfRTNVMTgxSmhMMVYyNXg0WmxNV2U3OExSekdsT2JKY19kMURDUFpsdUNuSm9oSWNJZUFrYVhkYXpLX0k0TkFILTRKUEw4MnRVZnNmVXFXLTcybDhZTmhVd0hiTtIBtgFBVV95cUxObUdDVXN2ME5OU25HMnM3TWdIS1k5c0YtemtLcUpfTTV3aFlmbGtZREh6bUlhYjFGZWN1WDdfZ3BqRTBQNVVPRWxCdTZVYnpKZndCU2lKUDlCZ291TUI2SHlyZkJSM3FnZzNBdndCMEk2ei1vVFVWdHRuQkVIaWcxNVd6dkhQRTRIZEpwNDk4MkZhcWQ5SEFQOEtyZGxDZEo3ZkRVaC1jNVdvcDVDUGZoQVp0SnBuZw</guid></item><item><title>感染多达50%人群的寄生虫可使人类精子斩首- ScienceAlert | Parasite Infecting Up to 50% of People Can Decapitate Human Sperm - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNTXNKel8zRHlhb1F5NlZsZVhYSzVTWE5KeUtVZDVoQTdYbkJIekwwZEthZU80Z1BkUEh3RGtwUDFXbmNyVnJ6bW51LVp0MF94b1VVZU1OSXZ6a29uUW05aTBlSm9TcU9tQmUya211aWdfMjhHZm9BYV8wbHdNT2FZd1RoY0k5Z3hzbWk4ZjI5djZuQkVYZi1DSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that "human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact" with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOnhthD3yz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

(&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;Rojas-Barón et al/The FEBS Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate male reproductive organs in animals is compelling, but whether this produces health issues in people remains unclear. Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it's likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite's potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256892/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;BOWBELLS, N.D. — More cases of 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/topics/measles" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;
    
       have been identified in North Dakota, including in a previously uninfected county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Dakota Health and Human Services Department announced on Thursday, May 29, the state’s 28th case, up seven from last week. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The latest case was the first reported in Burke County in far northwest North Dakota. The release did not identify the age of the infected individual but said they traveled frequently to 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-reports-first-case-of-measles-since-2011" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Williams County, where the first case was reported.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams County has nearly half the state’s cases with 13 infections, according to Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has reported 23 cases in people who are less than 20 years old, including three in children 5 years old or younger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Burke is the fourth county in North Dakota to have a measles case. Cass and Grand Forks counties reported seven cases each as of Thursday. At the end of last week, Cass County reported six cases and Grand Forks County reported two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in Divide County may have been exposed to the virus, Health and Human Services said. Places of possible exposure in Crosby include Lindsey’s Grocery Store at 211 Main St. S. from 3 to 5:30 p.m. Monday and Dollar General, 1108 Fourth St. SE, between 3:20 and 5:45 p.m. Monday, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the highest number of measles cases reported in North Dakota since 1978, when 211 cases occurred,” state Immunization Director Molly Howell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota has a vaccination rate of almost 90%. The risk of measles to vaccinated residents is low, Health and Human Services said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious since it can spread through the air and linger in rooms for up to two hours, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with measles are contagious before and after symptoms appear, increasing the risk of unintentional spread,” the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state recommends two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — the first between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection, while one dose is 93% effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The MMR vaccine is effective for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents who were born before 1957 are considered immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have contracted the virus should monitor symptoms for 21 days, while unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles should quarantine for the same time period, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information on measles and the vaccine can be found at

of offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOZy1LcWVVZnFMSlRaWU1NQnRxaGJJRnZOeXFmMHhkRHpXTnJZSVZ3ZzZPbUd0RzctQ3NUMDNhQkVYSUlHV3lzVVd5ZnotQndvV1R6MjA3eFlTZ1B2dzF2WF9ybmxXVEpTeWdFTTZaOEVZaHNvanVnVEZxYWVjay1vTDQwSUE0d1VMS2xJVmNJUUpNVkJkQ3liSDdaOGExcjlxa2pDXzYzd0VKX19DdWVzaHhQWklEbjhlcUZ4OA</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您应该吃7种最好的罐头食品，以获得更好的血糖- EatingWell | The 7 Best Canned Foods You Should Be Eating for Better Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE55Mkpnc2FOek1Fc19HLS1KUkZfenBoSGlURXlCTHVyQndoY3p6aFdUSUs4Smp0N0NadGpWbi0tUjJQM0w3aXRRcU50eEh0VW9CLXAtaENDaElJcXZLRXZ1X2JmSkc2YXhBN1ozQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned foods can be a nutrient-packed option for making blood-sugar-friendly meals and snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned food high in protein and fiber can help stabilize blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for low-sodium and no-sugar-added options, rinse if needed and consider store brands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support healthy blood sugar levels, it's crucial to focus on what you eat throughout the day. Eating balanced meals and snacks that include nutrient-dense foods with fiber and protein is important for blood sugar management—and canned foods are a convenient way to make this possible. We spoke to nutrition experts to find out which canned foods are best for blood sugar. Here are their top picks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish, such as tuna and salmon, are great protein options to keep on hand for managing blood sugar. “Protein slows digestion and increases satiety, or feelings of fullness, which promotes stable blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://lilianshepherd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lilian Shepherd, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;One 3.5-ounce serving of canned tuna contains 19 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canned salmon provides about 22 grams of protein per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These fish also pack omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to support brain health and may help prevent cognitive decline as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shepherd suggests having &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7935164/tuna-salad-with-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna Salad with Egg&lt;/a&gt; for a filling lunch or using canned salmon to make these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248780/easy-salmon-cakes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Salmon Cakes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-canned-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Canned Chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned chicken is a no-fuss way to add lean protein to many recipes without the need to cook, a great shortcut for recipes that call for shredded or rotisserie chicken. A 3.5-ounce serving of canned chicken contains 25 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try using canned chicken in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8024089/creamy-broccoli-cauliflower-chicken-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Broccoli-Cauliflower Chicken Casserole&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-canned-vegetables"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Canned Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned vegetables are a convenient and affordable way to add more fiber and micronutrients to your diet, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;they are just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in canned veggies slows digestion, helping to prevent blood sugar spikes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned veggies are incredibly versatile and can be tossed into casseroles and soups, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261637/slow-cooker-vegetable-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Slow-Cooker Vegetable Soup&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use them as a simple side dish. Look for low-sodium or no-salt-added options to limit sodium intake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-canned-tomatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Canned Tomatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a couple of cans of tomatoes in your pantry is always a good idea. “Canned tomatoes can flavor soups and stews and can be used to make salsa or pasta sauces,” says &lt;a href="https://ontheroadmeals.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hannah Heredia, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of On the Road Meals. “They are fairly low in carbohydrates and rich in antioxidants like lycopene, which supports heart health."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Add a can of tomatoes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-budget-friendly-canned-tomato-recipes-8412101" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;budget-friendly, healthy dishes&lt;/a&gt; like casseroles, curries and one-pot pastas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-canned-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Canned Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent source of fiber and plant-based protein, and both nutrients are important for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. A 3.5-ounce serving of canned black beans provides about 7 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber, while 3.5 ounces of canned chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) provides 7 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This combination of protein and fiber slows down glucose absorption and helps maintain steady blood sugar levels throughout the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.musiccitynutritionandwellness.com/music-city-nutrition-and-wellness-founder-emily-haddock" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Haddock, RD,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian and owner of Music City Nutrition &amp;amp; Wellness. She also recommends adding canned beans to soups, salads and grain bowls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-canned-pumpkin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Canned Pumpkin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned pumpkin is rich in fiber, with one 3.5-ounce serving of canned pumpkin puree containing 3 grams of it. Pumpkin also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties thanks to its high vitamin A content, providing more than 100% of your Daily Value of the nutrient per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Haddock suggests using canned pumpkin in sauces for savory dishes or adding it to smoothies for a creamy texture, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260736/pumpkin-pie-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pumpkin Pie Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. “Pumpkin also goes great in baked goods to enhance moisture and reduce fat content,” adds Haddock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another must-try? This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7911632/pumpkin-black-bean-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pumpkin &amp;amp; Black Bean Soup&lt;/a&gt; that combines two blood-sugar-friendly canned foods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-canned-fruit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Canned Fruit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fruit is a convenient and affordable option for managing blood sugar. “To reduce added sugar content, opt for canned fruits packed in water or fruit juices rather than syrup, if available,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-barron-ms-rd-ld-831b6843/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jessica Barron, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Red Head RD&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She also suggests pairing fruit with a food containing fat or protein to manage blood sugar. For example, try adding canned fruit to low-fat Greek yogurt or cottage cheese for a satisfying blood-sugar-friendly snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-shopping-tips"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Shopping Tips &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods can be a healthy and convenient option for managing blood sugar, as long as you know what to look for. Here are some things to consider when stocking your pantry:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opt for low-sodium or no-salt-added options when possible. While managing blood sugar is the focus, lower sodium intake may also help support healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When low-sodium options aren’t available, rinse canned foods under cool running water to reduce sodium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in canned foods, especially for fruits that are canned in syrup. Look for options with no added sugars or those canned in water or their own juice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the expiration date. Canned foods have a long shelf life, but they don’t last forever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t dismiss store brands. There’s a common misconception that store brands are lower quality compared to their branded counterparts. Grocery stores nationwide have affordable canned options, which can allow you to enjoy nutritious fruits and vegetables with less financial strain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-use-them"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Use Them &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A blood-sugar-friendly diet includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, fiber and healthy fats. Combining carbohydrates with protein, fiber and fat slows digestion, mitigating blood sugar swings and leaving you full and satisfied for longer. Here’s how to make the most out of canned foods:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canned beans are good for more than chili. Try them in a quick side dish, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259682/broccoli-chickpea-pomegranate-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Broccoli, Chickpea &amp;amp; Pomegranate Salad&lt;/a&gt;. Combine tuna and beans for a fiber-packed lunch or snack with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269012/tuna-white-bean-dill-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna, White Bean &amp;amp; Dill Salad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you normally use fresh fruits in your smoothies, salads, desserts and parfaits, canned fruits can be a big time and money saver. We also love using canned fruit in recipes like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270911/easy-peach-cobbler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Peach Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266430/cabbage-tofu-edamame-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Cabbage, Tofu &amp;amp; Edamame Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a lackluster salad that’s missing protein? Try adding canned chicken or fish for a protein and flavor boost. Toss in some canned chickpeas for extra protein and fiber. You can also use canned chicken in soups and casseroles the same way as you would use cooked chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a healthy diet high in protein, fiber and healthy fats is important for healthy blood sugar levels. Canned foods offer convenient, affordable and shelf-stable options, making it easier and quicker to prepare balanced meals and snacks. Add canned vegetables to soups and stews, or serve canned fruits like pineapple or peaches as a healthy dessert. When shopping, look for canned foods without added sugars and excess sodium.

Researchers used EEG and AI to analyze sleep in 40 adults after caffeine or placebo intake, identifying less predictable brain signals and increased wake-like brainwave patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine altered deep sleep rhythms by dampening theta and alpha waves while stimulating beta waves linked to alertness. These effects were most pronounced in 20-somethings, likely due to age-related differences in adenosine receptor density, suggesting younger brains are more vulnerable to caffeine’s nighttime impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine reduced slow-wave sleep rhythms and increased beta wave activity, keeping the brain in a more alert state overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine pushed the brain into a higher state of complexity, balancing order and chaos, even during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger adults (20–27) experienced stronger effects due to higher adenosine receptor density.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in April in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain’s recovery, both physical and cognitive, overnight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM’s Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab’s director Karim Jerbi, a psychology professor and researcher at Mila – Quebec AI Institute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM’s Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine’s effect on sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain “criticality” during sleep.  Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos,” said Jerbi. “It’s like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there’s cacophony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: it can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Added Carrier: “Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night: the brain would neither relax nor recover properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier’s team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram.  They compared each participant’s brain activity on two separate nights — one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used advanced statistical analysis and artificial intelligence to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity,” said Thölke, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that’s crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain’s electrical rhythms during sleep: caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves, generally associated with deep, restorative sleep, and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine,” says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This change in the brain’s rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in young adults between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine’s ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants,” Carrier said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And these age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given caffeine’s widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on brain activity across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this caffeine, sleep, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe94d09d918c9a9b9f8bd3999f849f9792929bbe8b9391908a8c9b9f92d09d9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Gazaille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umontreal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Gazaille – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Philipp Thölke et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant worldwide. Yet important gaps persist in understanding its effects on the brain, especially during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in 40 subjects, contrasting 200 mg of caffeine against a placebo condition, utilizing inferential statistics and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that caffeine ingestion led to an increase in brain complexity, a widespread flattening of the power spectrum’s 1/f-like slope, and a reduction in long-range temporal correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being most prominent during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, these results suggest that caffeine shifts the brain towards a critical regime and more diverse neural dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults (20–27 years) compared to middle-aged participants (41–58 years) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while no significant age effects were observed during NREM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting these data in the light of modeling and empirical work on EEG-derived measures of excitation-inhibition balance suggests that caffeine promotes a shift in brain dynamics towards increased neural excitation and closer proximity to a critical regime, particularly during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 22:40:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBrTE9DNHZJeWlZZ1lyVElCc1ZCU1YtYXZrMDc5VjV5UDF1dVVuYklHX044cDF3cURSb1gtZjFHcTZtVWZmcnNoMHdtMURpTDY3NWRiX3h0ckxjVHcyeWN2dzcwMUREWlNocGpOWmR3</guid></item><item><title>数百万美国人服用的常见草药补充剂可能与致命的肝损伤有关-雅虎 | Common herbal supplements taken by millions of Americans could be linked to deadly liver damage - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTXBidFpySm1YTmNabEJFTE1JS2ZGb0RtUEZSQ2Z3aUswZGx1SEpvU2txeFAwX092OEZpaEJvM1lOSERla2k3aHR0QnV3THBOZHViZmJJUEFRRzdSQWxTeDNnbUo1bmpPSU9VSmZJSnJKcERBaEs0RmQtaDFLeXp6NmdQZ1Q1T2ZpYkFXS0F2M2Q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Commonly-used herbal and dietary supplements taken by millions of Americans to stay healthy have been tied to a rising number of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/adults-liver-disorder-over-eating-b2058118.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:liver damage and toxicity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;liver damage and toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Supplement-related liver failure that required U.S. patients to be put on a waitlist for a transplant increased by eight times the previous level from 1995 through 2020, according to a 2022 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liver Transplantation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

But, overuse of some can result in liver damage and toxicity (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, what are the offending supplements tied to these cases? You may regularly use them in cooking. Many patients take them with the aim of improving their health. The bright yellow spice turmeric is the most commonly consumed in the U.S., according to a study published last year in the journal&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Network Open;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;. Black cohosh, red yeast rice, &lt;em&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/em&gt;, and green tea extract were also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11301549/#:~:text=Turmeric%20or%20curcumin%2C%20green%20tea,the%20general%20population%20are%20unknown." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:identified on a list compiled by researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;identified on a list compiled by researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000 milligrams plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric,” Halegoua-De Marzio said, noting that adding black pepper could make the liver “really sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Online, many of these supplements are promoted as more natural options than prescription medications. But, they are not subject to the same kind of testing and scrutiny as other drugs. That’s not the only issue. Physicians say insufficient attention in medical screenings and mislabeling are two other problems to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50 percent mismatch between stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming,” Dr. Robert Fontana, a University of Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/15-million-americans-take-supplements-may-be-toxic-liver" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it's basically a coin flip if that’s true or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/new-research-on-the-potential-dangers-of-turmeric-supplements-2292932" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fewer than 40 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fewer than 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of patients willingly tell their doctors about the supplements they are taking, according to Kaiser Permanente primary care physician Dr. Crystal Xue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Without the guiding hand of doctors, people who take too much may not realize the risk. New Jersey’s Robert Grafton told NBC News that if he hadn’t been in the medical field, he might have taken more supplements to help him feel better. Instead, following a trip to the hospital, he found out he had a drug-induced liver injury after taking ashwagandha, turmeric pills, and other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking turmeric and green tea extract is linked to risk, according to University of Michigan researchers. Most users do not take the supplements on the advice of a doctor (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people are even genetically vulnerable to this kind of damage. Although, that’s also true for prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17915-toxic-hepatitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms of liver damage and toxicity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Symptoms of liver damage and toxicity&lt;/a&gt; can differ, but generally include fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, urine changes, and &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/new-research-on-the-potential-dangers-of-turmeric-supplements-2292932" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:jaundice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;jaundice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2903197/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:44,000 estimated cases of liver damage associated with the drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;44,000 estimated cases of liver damage associated with the drugs&lt;/a&gt; each year, including 2,700 deaths.

&lt;p&gt;Cases of babesiosis, a rare disease most commonly spread by bites from deer ticks, are growing in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic region, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, and so is the range of ticks infected with the parasite that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a new tick-borne disease to watch out for can be worrisome, researchers are aiming to ensure that residents and health care providers are informed about the illness and its growing threat in the area, especially as summer approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a freak-out issue because we can diagnose it and we have a cure,” said Ellen Stromdahl, an entomologist who worked at the Defense Centers for Public Health’s vector-borne disease laboratory in Aberdeen. “It’s an awareness issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-WczsESEJ" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_WczsESEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stromdahl was one of nearly two dozen researchers who collected and tested ticks in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, looking for ones that carried the parasite that causes babesiosis. Less than 3% of the deer ticks researchers tested were found to be infected with the parasite, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland’s Eastern Shore and the Baltimore region are hot spots for ticks carrying babesiosis, the study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with babesiosis don’t feel sick or have symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some may experience flu-like symptoms such as a fever, chills, sweating, body aches, appetite loss, nausea or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms may start a week after being infected, but typically develop over the course of a few weeks or months. The illness can be worse — even life-threatening — for older people or for those who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but if it’s overlooked, the consequences can be really bad,” Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of reported cases of babesiosis in Maryland remains low, though data from the Maryland Department of Health show an increase over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, for instance, there were 29 reported babesiosis cases in Maryland — a jump from seven cases in 2022 and 13 cases in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease, Maryland’s most common tick-borne illness, is far more prevalent, with 2,463 probable cases reported in 2023. Some symptoms of Lyme disease can be similar to babesiosis, but the two illnesses are treated differently, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors generally prescribe antibiotics for Lyme disease. But if you’re still sick even after taking antibiotics, it may be time to return to the doctor and ask about babesiosis, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to stay safe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend time outside in grassy, bushy or wooded areas, wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. When you come inside, check your clothing and body for any ticks. And if you find a tick, remove it quickly using tweezers. You can dispose of the tick by putting it in a sealed bag or submersing it in alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a tick, you can save it to show to a doctor, too, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;

The prolonged dry seasons can extend the periods of high-risk exposure to valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is often misdiagnosed because the symptoms (cough, fever and chest pains) are similar to other infectious diseases, which can make it difficult for health officials to accurately report the number of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of valley fever cases so far this year is trending toward a new record but public health officials say it’s still &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-04-25/valley-fever-cases-record-high"&gt;too early in the year to determine&lt;/a&gt; whether this will be a record breaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some precautions to help locals, hikers and tourists in counties with high numbers of reported valley fever cases to avoid the disease this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-contracting-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself from contracting valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in Fresno County, which includes a section of the John Muir Trail, share the following cautionary tips for hikers: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay on well-maintained trails and avoid activities that kick up dust such as digging or biking off-path. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider wearing a properly fitted N95 mask when hiking in dusty or dry conditions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid hiking during windy days or right after a disturbance that may increase dust in the air. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean any skin wounds well with soap and water, especially if they have been exposed to soil or dust. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who lives, works or travels in an area where valley fever fungus grows, the CDC recommends: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay indoors when it’s windy outside and the air is dusty. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On windy days, keep windows and doors closed to prevent dust and possible spores from entering the home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When driving through a dusty area, keep car windows closed and use recirculating air, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before digging, wet down soil and dirt to prevent stirring up dust into the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider wearing a properly fitted N95 mask if you must be in dusty air outdoors in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-at-risk-of-contracting-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;Who is at risk of contracting valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who spend a lot of time outdoors and are exposed to dirt and dust in areas where valley fever is common are more likely to contract the disease, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. That includes construction workers, farmers, military workers and archaeologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live and work near dry and dusty areas are also at risk of being exposed to valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have an increased risk of contracting the disease include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults 60 years and older.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who have diabetes or health conditions that weaken the immune system, which include cancer, HIV, autoimmune illnesses, those with an organ transplant or who are receiving chemotherapy or steroids. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women, especially those in the later stages of pregnancy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children who are 5 years old and younger. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who are of Black, Latino, Native American or Filipino decent, although &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank"&gt;experts say they don’t have a clear answer&lt;/a&gt; on why these groups of people are more susceptible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;What are the symptoms of valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus infects the lungs and can cause respiratory symptoms that include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle or joint pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night sweats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Valley fever shares many of the same symptoms as other respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, it takes about one to three weeks for valley fever symptoms to develop, and the illness can last a month or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with valley fever may experience only mild symptoms that get better in a few weeks so treatment won’t be necessary, according to Los Angeles County public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are others who will have symptoms that last a month or longer and may need treatment depending on their doctor’s consultation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare severe cases, the disease can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is usually diagnosed with a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you test negative for COVID-19 and have respiratory symptoms that last more than a week, and live in or have recently traveled to an area where valley fever is more common, public health officials suggest you talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because valley fever affects each person differently, treatment will be determined based on the severity of the disease. The disease is often treated with antifungal medications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 21:26:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQbnNXeXFkNlREU2lRU1FBR19tWWtVdnNCWU9BS2podkJtMDlwNmFPM2pzVVBKb19oczlrOWMtcS1mN0luWGJNUDVLX0ZBcW5aQ0pvdTdZeHJXejNmTlUwTHJwMzBQZzRMUkJfcl92WHJPTkxfbG1NREJNNE9IZWtJN1hVM05TV0pTQ0MzVGFkN2lJNi1udTFrRi04ci1GX3J4TzljaFVKSzFFbXV1cjFITW5ia3NzLTN2TV9nVE9JVV9Hazh6TUlJV2c2ODY0LUU3TGdNM3JSY2ZDZkI3ZW5tamxEQ3pzZVd3TWp5bg</guid></item><item><title>一名男子在“大脑爆发”后死于蜱传病毒。现在他的家人正在警告其他人- AOL.com | Man Died from Tick-Borne Virus After His ‘Brain Had Blown Up'.

He started experiencing headaches, vomiting and other flu-like symptoms that rapidly progressed. Days later, the 62-year-old collapsed in his home and was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors diagnosed Kevin with Powassan virus, a rare and dangerous tick-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus is rare but the number of cases has significantly increased in the past decade. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures. Severe cases can lead to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (myelitis). About 10% of these advanced cases are fatal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/powassan-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin explained that despite Kevin being treated in the ICU, he ultimately suffered severe brain damage from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His brain had blown up so much, from the encephalitis, and he had really bad brain damage," she told &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/ticks-massachusetts-powassan-virus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;. "It was horrifying, but we knew what Kevin would want, so you know, we just had to let him go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A tick in the palm of a hand&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin died a few weeks after arriving at the hospital, leaving behind a wife, two sons and a granddaughter. Erin said that she and her family are now hoping that sharing Kevin’s story will encourage others to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just want the public to know what to look for and be wary of ticks, especially if you have one on your body," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 54 cases of Powassan virus disease were reported in the United States, with 12 cases reported in Massachusetts.According to the CDC, there are no vaccines to prevent POWV or medicines to treat it. However, a number of precautionary measures can be taken to avoid ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent exposure to ticks, according to the &lt;a href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/understanding-and-preventing-tick-bites" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, wear clothing that covers your arms and legs and tuck your pants into your socks or put tape around openings in clothing. Wear light-colored clothing so you can see if a tick is on you. When you are in the woods, keep to the center of the trail, since ticks tend to like shrubs and bushes. Use a chemical repellent with DEET, permethrin or picaridin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After coming indoors, check yourself, children and pets for ticks. If you do find one, use tweezers to remove it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a week to one month after the bite from an infected tick to develop symptoms of POWV disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/powassan-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Massachusetts Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that using margarine may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes by 41%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Margarine use may also raise the risk of heart disease by 29%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using non-hydrogenated products without trans fats may help you avoid health drawbacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The long-running debate over margarine or butter or other fats has been around for years, and rightfully so. Experts generally agree that trans fats, often found in older forms of margarine, should be avoided due to their link to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But saturated fats, commonly found in butter and other dairy products, remain controversial. While they’ve traditionally been associated with heart risks, some studies have suggested that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pasture-raised-cheese-heart-health-11700115" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy fats might actually offer certain health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Butter, however, has been noted in some research to increase "bad" LDL cholesterol, though not all studies agree.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Margarine and spreads similar to margarine are made from vegetable oils, which means they typically have less saturated fat than butter. Initially, margarine was believed to be a healthier alternative to butter for heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). But further research revealed that the trans fats in margarine could negatively impact health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While regulations in the U.S. have significantly reduced and eventually eliminated industrial trans fats in these products, the levels of trans fats in foods in some other countries remain a concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, oils vary in their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mix of unsaturated and saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, and some margarines contain trans fats if they are partially hydrogenated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers are still trying to fully understand how long-term consumption of butter, margarine and non-hydrogenated oils (like olive oil) impacts heart disease and diabetes. Current dietary advice suggests limiting saturated fats, but some recent studies indicate that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027676/best-dairy-foods-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy fat might have certain health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more, a recent study was conducted to bridge this knowledge gap, and the results were published in the&lt;em&gt; European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Offspring cohort, involving over 5,000 participants. The Framingham Offspring cohort concluded in 2014 after more than 40 years of data collection. After excluding participants who had certain traits, like having low or high body weights or drinking excessive alcohol intake, the researchers evaluated data from 2,459 subjects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To gather information about what participants ate, researchers asked them to record everything they consumed over two sets of three days, covering two weekdays and one weekend day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis looked at three main types of fats people use in cooking and eating:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Butter, which can come in tub or stick form &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Margarine, which can be full-fat or lower-fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-hydrogenated oils, such as olive oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, palm oil, soy oil and blends of these. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers investigated potential links between consumption of these foods and cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four years after the final dietary assessment, researchers measured body fat, cholesterol and blood sugar levels to better understand participants' health. Since data from this later exam wasn't fully available, some information, like insulin resistance, was taken from the previous exam. Blood samples, taken after participants fasted overnight, were tested for "good" cholesterol (HDL), "bad" cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides and blood sugar levels using reliable methods. Body mass index (BMI) was also calculated. All of this data was used to track and evaluate various health outcomes over time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more margarine (around 7 grams or more per day compared to 2 grams or less) was linked to a higher risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, people who consumed more margarine had about a 29% higher chance of heart health problems and a 41% greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Oils didn’t appear to affect the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings also indicated that people who consumed the most butter had a 31% &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-diabetes-risk-study-8736965" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who consumed less. Interestingly, both butter and oil seemed to be linked with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but the relationship wasn’t straightforward, and it varied depending on the amount consumed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/seeds-oils-inflammation-study-8740767" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;non-hydrogenated oils was linked&lt;/a&gt; to slightly higher levels of body fat, but neither butter nor margarine showed any clear connection to body fat levels. However, when factors like age, sex, body weight, carbohydrate intake and diet quality were considered, people who consumed more butter and non-hydrogenated oils had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower levels of insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to blood cholesterol levels, butter stood out as the only fat that showed a positive connection with "good" HDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood) and a healthier balance between triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. On the other hand, eating more than 7 grams of non-hydrogenated oil per day, compared to 2 grams or less, was linked to higher levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol. For margarine, however, there didn’t seem to be any significant effects on cholesterol or blood fat levels in these analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An important limitation is that the study participants were mostly white and European, which means the findings may not apply to people from other backgrounds. Additionally, while efforts were made to consider other possible influencing factors, it’s still possible that not all of them were accounted for.  Another limitation of the study is the reliance on self-reported dietary data, which can be prone to inaccuracies and biases, such as underreporting or overestimating food intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Furthermore, as the study is based on observational data, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the variables, only correlations. Finally, margarine, particularly at the time of the dietary data collection in this study, was more likely to contain industrial trans fats, which may not reflect the effects of margarines available at many retail stores that are free from those fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are focused on making dietary choices to support your health, understanding these findings can help. For instance, if you're someone who enjoys using butter, this research suggests that moderate consumption might not be as harmful as once feared. Butter’s potential association with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/284021/5-new-things-to-know-about-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; may provide some reassurance, especially when balanced with an otherwise healthy diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s essential to keep portion sizes and overall saturated fat intake in mind, as excess consumption may still have negative health implications. For those looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, using non-hydrogenated oils like olive or safflower oil for cooking might be a better option when prioritizing healthy fats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For margarine consumers, this study highlights the importance of being mindful about the products you choose. Opting for newer formulations that don’t contain trans fats is crucial, as older or partially hydrogenated margarines are linked to higher risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; sheds valuable light on how various fats may impact health. In particular, it found that regular margarine use may raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Choosing newer margarine products that are free of trans fats may help you avoid some of those health effects. This study also observed that butter, once widely criticized for its saturated fat content, shows potential benefits when consumed in moderation, particularly its association with improved HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels. Non-hydrogenated oils also appear to be a solid choice for heart health, offering healthier fat profiles, though they do require mindful consumption due to their potential link to higher LDL cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the key takeaway is that balance and informed choices are essential. Rather than demonizing or overly glorifying a single type of fat, focusing on variety and high-quality options may lead to better health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;

Any movement is better than none—&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that walking just 4,400 steps a day can lower your risk of death by 41 percent compared to fewer than 2,700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That said, if your goal is &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a63333085/how-long-should-i-walk-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a63333085/how-long-should-i-walk-to-lose-weight/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight loss" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, some structure can help. Walking contributes to your overall calorie burn and helps increase NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), which refers to the energy you burn outside of structured workouts.

Vary The Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If you’re really committed to using walking as a key weight loss tool, I would do variable terrains,' she says. “Everything from cross country and hilly walks to beach walks and roads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This will challenge you, as the uneven terrain stimulates different muscles in the ankles, knees, hips and core, she explains. "You can also choose to power it up by walking up a few hills or an incline to work your heart, lungs and your whole body a little more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="23" class="css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;2. A Brisk Pace Is Best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking to make the most of your daily walk, personal trainer Scott Laidler, CPT, has some advice on turning it up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If your goal is weight loss, I’d recommend aiming for 5,000-7,000 steps performed at an elevated or brisk pace," Laidler says. Why? Because speeding up your stroll and walking uphill will increase your heart rate—and that’s when you begin to burn calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"When your heart rate reaches upwards of 100-120 bpm, age-dependent, [or roughly 60-70 percent of your maximum heart rate; 220 minus your age], you enter what’s known as the fat-burning zone, where fat is used as your primary energy source," Laidler adds. In other words, you torch cals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;3.

It said the findings suggest a rapid, potent, and durable immune response. Pre-existing immunity was minimal at baseline, with 2.1% of participants showing hemagglutinin titers at a level considered to correlate with protection. At day 43, which was 3 weeks after the second dose, 97.9% of participants had a 44.5-fold increase in titers from baseline,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;St&lt;span lang="FR"&gt;é&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="PT"&gt;phane Bancel, MBA, MS, Moderna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s chief executive officer, said, &lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

RTX is a non-addictive pain therapy derived from a cactus-like plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Health (NIH) scientists report that a first-in-human clinical trial of a new therapy based on the plant-derived molecule resiniferatoxin (RTX) shows that it is a safe and effective agent for pain control in patients with intractable cancer pain. Researchers tested a single injection of small quantities of RTX into the lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (by lumbar puncture) of advanced-stage cancer patients and found that it reduced their reported worst pain intensity by 38% and their use of pain-relieving opioids by 57%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The effects are immediate,” said Andrew Mannes, M.D., lead study author and chief of the NIH Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine. “This is a potential new therapy from a new family of drugs that gives people with severe cancer pain an opportunity to return some normality to their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial enrolled research participants with terminal end-stage cancer who were among the 15% of cancer patients unable to find pain relief from standard of care pain interventions, including vast quantity of opiates without relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single injection of RTX provided patients durable relief. Patients’ need for pain-relieving opioids declined sharply, and their quality of life improved. They no longer needed to spend significant periods being sedated with opioids and after treatment were able to reengage with their family, friends and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH scientists believe RTX has potential to treat many other pain conditions, including other types of cancer pain, chronic pain from nerve injuries called neuromas, post-surgical pain, a facial pain condition called trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic oral inflammatory problems following head and neck radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Targeting specific nerves brings many pain disorders into range of RTX and allows physicians to tailor the treatment to the patient’s pain problem. This interventional approach is a simple path to personalized pain medicine,” said senior study author Michael Iadarola, PhD, a senior research scientist in the NIH Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTX is not addictive and doesn’t cause a high. Instead, it prevents pain signals from reaching the brain by inactivating a specific sub-group of nerve fibers which transmit heat and pain signals from damaged tissue. RTX is an activator of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, or  TRPV1 ion channel and a super-potent equivalent of capsaicin, the active molecule in hot peppers. The ability of RTX to open the channel pore in TRPV1 allows an overload of calcium to flood into the nerve fiber and block its ability to transmit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Basically, RTX cuts the pain-specific wires connecting the body to the spinal cord, but leaves many other sensations are intact,” Iadarola said. “These TRPV1 neurons are really the most important population of neurons that you want to target for effective pain relief.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iadarola’s contributions have led decades of basic science research into the neurobiology of pain and pain control. That body of research has informed them that to effectively block pain, you must block it from getting into the spinal cord and from there having it leave the spinal cord to transit to the brain, where we perceive pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other current approaches that use heat, cold, chemicals, or surgery to non-selectively interrupt nerves to stop pain, RTX targets the specific sensory pathways of tissue damage pain and heat. Other sensory pathways, such as touch, pin prick, pressure, muscle position sense (known as proprioception), and motor function, remain intact. It is not a generalized numbing as occurs with local anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What makes this unique from all the other things that are out there is this is so highly selective,” Mannes said. “The only thing it seems to take out is heat sensation and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTX is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Euphorbia resinifera&lt;/em&gt; plant, a cactus-like plant native to North Africa. Euphorbia extract has been known for 2,000 years to contain an “irritant” substance, which NIH scientists identified how to use for patients through basic research on living cells observed through a microscope. Adding RTX to TRPV1-containing cells caused a visible calcium overload, which Iadarola and Mannes eventually translated into an early-stage human clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next steps include additional, larger clinical trials to move RTX toward eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and clinical availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH Clinical Center and NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taurine, a common ingredient in energy drinks and supplements, was found to fuel the growth of aggressive leukemia cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leukemia cells use a specific transporter protein to absorb taurine, and certain cells in the body — including those in the bones, brain, and heart — are capable of producing taurine naturally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows that inhibiting taurine production or its uptake by cancer cells slowed leukemic progression, indicating a potential new treatment strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It seems that energy drinks are everywhere. The U.S. energy drink market alone &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/360940/energy-drinks-health-risks-caffeine-celsius-monster-red-bull-panera-charged-lemonade-taurine-guarana-arrhythmia" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grew by 73%&lt;/a&gt; between 2018 to 2023 and was valued at a staggering &lt;a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/us-energy-drinks-market-report" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;$23.9 billion in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09018-7" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides compelling evidence that, in certain circumstances, taurine, the common ingredient that gives those drinks their kick, could be fueling more than just your afternoon energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In May, researchers from the University of Rochester published their findings on taurine and its role in driving the growth of aggressive forms of leukemia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team behind the study, led by researchers at the University of Rochester, discovered that taurine doesn’t just get digested when you drink it or take it in supplements. Instead, certain cells in our bones, brain, heart, and muscles can also actively produce it (and it is often found in &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-taurine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish and meat as well&lt;/a&gt;). In individuals with leukemia, taurine appears to stimulate the multiplication of cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand why, it helps to know a little about how blood cancers like leukemia flourish in the body. Leukemia, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/adult-aml-treatment-pdq" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;National Cancer Institute explains&lt;/a&gt;, often starts with a small number of damaged stem cells in the bone marrow, which is also where your blood is produced. These cancer stem cells can grow uncontrollably and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/acute-myeloid-leukemia/about/what-is-aml.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hinder the body&lt;/a&gt; from producing the red and white blood cells it needs. Furthermore, this new study shows that those leukemia cells may be nourished by the taurine your body already produces. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers discovered that as leukemia progresses, certain cells in human bone marrow begin producing more taurine, as the cancer cells absorb it through a specific protein known as TauT, which stands for taurine transporter. This taurine can assist the cancer cells in generating energy more efficiently, potentially causing them to grow at an accelerated rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, in mouse models, when the researchers blocked either the production of taurine in the bone or the cancer cells’ ability to absorb it, the growth of leukemia slowed. The mice with leukemia lived longer, and their cancer spread less quickly, indicating a potential new pathway for treating this disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,” Jeevisha Bajaj, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics at the University of Rochester, and lead author of the study, &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's essential to understand that this study does not state or imply that energy drinks and supplements will cause cancer in any way. However, it found that when the mice with leukemia were given additional taurine, similar to what you would consume in energy drinks, the cancer progressed significantly faster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's also important to remember that taurine has been shown in early-stage studies to be potentially helpful for people &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/cancerjournal/fulltext/2015/11020/effect_of_taurine_on_attenuating.35.aspx#:~:text=by%20taurine%20supplementation.-,CONCLUSION,drug%20reactions%20for%20the%20patients." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;undergoing chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, as it could help mitigate side effects like nausea. Additionally, other studies have also shown that taurine couldmight have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900303-9" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;combat gastric cancers&lt;/a&gt; in the stomach.
&lt;/p&gt;

The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant called LP.8.1 is currently the dominant version in the U.S. and globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The findings show that individuals with Alzheimer’s who used SSRIs had lower levels of tau protein in the blood and showed restored activity in a brain region typically impaired by the disease. However, their performance on standard cognitive tests varied depending on the specific measure used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that leads to memory loss, behavioral changes, and ultimately, a loss of independence. One of the main drivers of Alzheimer’s progression is the accumulation of a protein called tau, which forms tangled clumps inside neurons and interferes with their function. Tau pathology is strongly linked to cognitive decline, and researchers have long sought ways to reduce or slow its buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs are a class of antidepressants commonly prescribed to treat major depressive disorder and anxiety. They work by increasing levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that affects mood, sleep, and cognition. The serotonergic system has also been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, as some of the earliest signs of tau pathology appear in a serotonin-producing brain region known as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). This brainstem region plays a key role in regulating serotonin levels throughout the brain, and its dysfunction is thought to contribute to both depression and Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this link, researchers set out to examine whether long-term SSRI use could influence Alzheimer’s pathology, brain metabolism, and cognitive outcomes. They drew on data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large multi-site study that collects medical, cognitive, and imaging data from people at various stages of cognitive health. The analysis included 191 adults, all of whom had baseline brain scans using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, a tool that measures glucose metabolism in brain tissue. Participants also provided blood samples and underwent cognitive testing over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the effects of SSRIs, the researchers divided participants into those who had a documented history of SSRI use and those who did not. They excluded individuals who had ever used other types of antidepressants to isolate the effects of SSRIs. The participants were categorized as cognitively normal or diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease based on clinical assessments and standard diagnostic criteria. In the group with Alzheimer’s, 65 participants had used SSRIs, while 92 had not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary markers the researchers looked at was phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), a form of tau protein found in the bloodstream that reflects tau accumulation in the brain. Among participants with Alzheimer’s disease, those who used SSRIs had significantly lower levels of plasma p-tau181 compared to non-users. This difference was not observed in cognitively healthy individuals, suggesting that the potential benefit of SSRIs in reducing tau may be specific to those with Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined how SSRIs affected brain metabolism, focusing on the DRN. In individuals with Alzheimer’s who did not use SSRIs, this brain region showed significantly reduced metabolic activity—an indication of impaired function. In contrast, those with Alzheimer’s who used SSRIs displayed restored activity in the DRN, with glucose metabolism levels similar to those of healthy participants. Interestingly, this effect was not seen in healthy participants who used SSRIs, suggesting that the drug’s impact on DRN function may be specific to disease-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at how SSRI use affected cognitive performance using three standard assessments: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum of boxes. Across the two-year follow-up, MMSE scores declined in all participants with Alzheimer’s, regardless of SSRI use, indicating ongoing cognitive deterioration. However, MoCA scores were slightly higher among SSRI users, suggesting some preservation of certain cognitive functions. CDR scores, which assess the severity of dementia symptoms, increased over time in both groups, with a slightly greater increase in SSRI users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One unexpected finding was that the relationship between MMSE and MoCA scores shifted in those who used SSRIs. Normally, these two assessments are closely correlated because they measure overlapping aspects of cognition. But in SSRI users, this correlation broke down, possibly pointing to selective effects of the drug on certain cognitive domains or a shift in how these domains are measured. The researchers suggest that future studies should include more specific cognitive tests to determine which areas are most affected by SSRI use in Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the study has several limitations. The researchers were unable to assess the impact of different SSRI types, dosages, or treatment durations due to sample size constraints. They also could not account for other factors that may influence Alzheimer’s progression, such as co-occurring medical conditions, additional medications, or the timing of SSRI initiation relative to the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Because the study was cross-sectional, it also cannot confirm whether SSRI use causes reductions in tau or improved DRN function, or whether people who benefit from SSRIs in these ways are simply more likely to have used them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings provide new insights into how a widely used class of antidepressants may influence biological and functional aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. The study supports the idea that SSRI use is associated with lower levels of tau-related pathology and improved activity in a serotonin-rich brain region that plays an early role in disease development. However, the benefits for cognitive performance remain uncertain and may vary depending on how cognition is measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to clarify whether starting SSRI treatment at specific stages of Alzheimer’s progression offers more benefit, and whether certain subtypes of patients are more likely to respond positively. Longitudinal studies that follow people over time while tracking tau levels, brain function, and detailed cognitive outcomes could help answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14579" target="_blank"&gt;SSRIs reduce plasma tau and restore dorsal raphe metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Dylan J.

              &lt;p&gt;One of the world’s oldest diseases has an even more complex history than expected. Research out today reveals that a form of leprosy was stalking people in the Americas long before Europeans arrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of scientists conducted the study, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. The researchers found DNA evidence of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;—a recently discovered species of leprosy-causing bacteria—infecting people in North and South America over 1,000 years ago, predating European colonization. The findings upturn the prevailing belief that Europeans were responsible for leprosy’s introduction to the New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy"&gt;Leprosy’s&lt;/a&gt; reputation for human destruction is so notorious that it’s repeatedly referenced in the Bible (some of these references might have been about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17516561/"&gt;other conditions&lt;/a&gt;, though). These bacteria can cause a chronic infection of our skin and nerve cells, though it may take years for symptoms like lesions and sores to appear. If not treated with antibiotics, the infection can progressively and permanently damage these cells, leading to lifelong disabilities and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leprosy, also called Hansen’s disease, is primarily caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. But in 2008, scientists &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19019760/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that a similar species, &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;, can cause it, too. Leprosy from &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; appears to be rarer than the former, with cases predominantly found in North and South America. And we know very little about it, partly because both species aren’t easy to culture in the lab (much like viruses, leprosy-causing bacteria can only replicate by hijacking our cells from the inside).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Study author Nicolas Rascovan, who specializes in the evolution of human diseases, and his team decided to take a closer look at the bacteria after making a discovery of their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our interest began when we unexpectedly detected &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; DNA in the remains of an ancient individual in North America,” Rascovan, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, told Gizmodo. “That prompted us to ask how long this pathogen had been circulating in the continent, how much spread there was before European contact, and what diversity it might still hold today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed hundreds of samples collected from modern-day people (mostly recent leprosy patients), as well as ancient DNA samples recovered from people in the Americas before European contact. Three of these ancient samples tested positive for the bacteria, the researchers found, from people living in what’s now Canada and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Leprosy has long been considered a disease brought to the Americas by Europeans, which is true for the case of &lt;i&gt;M. leprae&lt;/i&gt;. But our study shows that at least one of the two species that causes it—&lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt;—was already here centuries earlier, and probably evolved locally for thousands of years,” Rascovan explained. “This essentially changes how we understand the disease’s history in the Americas.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to antibiotics and improved sanitation, leprosy is rare in much of the world (only about 200 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leprosy/about/index.html"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. every year). But it remains a public health issue in some countries, with more than 200,000 cases &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; annually globally. And the researchers’ findings may complicate both the past and future of leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While most modern cases of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; were linked to one specific lineage, or clade, of the bacteria that has recently expanded, the team also identified older clades that have likely been evolving independently in the Americas for over 9,000 years. That suggests these bacteria have been hiding out in still mysterious animal hosts (in the U.S. the classic form of leprosy has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/so-whats-going-on-with-leprosy-in-florida-1850696205"&gt;sometimes been linked to armadillo exposure&lt;/a&gt;). And though &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;still causes the majority of leprosy cases worldwide, its less famous cousin certainly has the potential to become a bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Given its diversity and spread, &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; could be an emerging pathogen with dynamics different from &lt;i&gt;M. leprae&lt;/i&gt;,” Rascovan said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is often the case in science, the team’s work has raised even more questions for them to answer. They’re hoping to unearth the animal reservoirs where the bacteria have potentially been circulating all this time, for instance, and to trace its journey from the Americas to other parts of the world. They now believe that a strain of &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; was brought over to the British Isles sometime in the 19th century, where it still infects red squirrels today. But we’re still in the dark about how it reached Asia, where cases have been documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All of this suggests that this is not just a neglected disease, but a neglected pathogen—one whose history and spread are only now beginning to be understood,” Rascovan said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Methyl adaptogens are natural compounds found in plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foods that researchers found decreased epigenetic age are green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic and berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 kUZVxN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study has revealed six foods men can eat to slow aging, and they are all plant-based" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-2586"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;A new study has revealed six foods men can eat to slow aging, and they are all plant-based&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typically, morning is the best time to poop for most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can train your body to poop in the morning with a few key tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most important thing is that you're pooping regularly and completely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you call it poop, No. 2 or a bowel movement, it’s about time we got more comfortable talking about it. As the kids’ book taught us: &lt;em&gt;Everyone Poops&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our stool can share secrets about everything from our fiber and water intake to the potential presence of an infection or disease. How much, how often and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292275/what-the-appearance-of-your-poop-can-tell-you-about-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;appearance of our poop&lt;/a&gt; can offer a robust window into our internal health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that the “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;normal” frequency for pooping&lt;/a&gt; ranges from twice per day to three times per week, we also wanted to find out if there was a best time of day to poop. So, we tapped two gastroenterologists to help us get to the bottom of this question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-there-a-best-time-to-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is There a Best Time to Poop? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ll cut to the chase: There’s not necessarily a “best” time of day to poop, admits &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Charleston, South Carolina-based gastroenterologist, owner of The Plant-Fed Gut and the author of &lt;em&gt;Fiber Fueled&lt;/em&gt;. Far more important than the exact time is a consistent time. “Similar to nearly all other life on this planet, our body functions on a rhythm that aligns with the rise and fall of the sun. Rhythm is important,” says Bulsiewicz. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our post-meal metabolic response, sleep quality and gut health are all impacted by our body’s natural rhythms. “When our gut is in rhythm, we are having good, complete and regular bowel movements that are satisfying. Having an irregular gut rhythm compromises our bowel motility [the movement of food and waste through the digestive system] and our gut microbiome. This may manifest with chronic constipation or irritable bowel syndrome,” explains Bulsiewicz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this rhythm is so critical, Kenneth Brown, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Plano, Texas, and the host of the &lt;em&gt;Gut Check Project &lt;/em&gt;podcast, says that certain times of day tend to be better than others in terms of setting a stool schedule. “In general,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the morning, shortly after waking up&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; tends to be the best time to poop for most individuals,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are three main reasons why morning may be best:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your circadian rhythms.&lt;/strong&gt; As we mentioned, our bodies operate on a 24-hour internal clock called our circadian rhythms, which regulates various physiological processes, including digestion. The colon tends to be more active during the day, with peak activity occurring in the morning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Simultaneously, our body experiences a rise in natural cortisol levels&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the A.M., which can stimulate bowel movements, adds Brown.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You fasted overnight.&lt;/strong&gt; “During sleep, our digestive system is relatively inactive, allowing the colon to accumulate stool,” says Brown. Bulsiewicz adds that this is a good thing, because it would be a drag having to wake up at night to poop. The colon fills up overnight, then in the morning, things pick back up, making morning a great time to have a bowel movement, both doctors agree. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gastrocolic reflex kicks in. &lt;/strong&gt;“After eating or drinking, our stomach stretches, triggering a physiological response called the gastrocolic reflex. This reflex stimulates the colon to contract and move its contents forward, leading to a bowel movement,” explains Brown. The morning is when this reflex is often the strongest, especially after we &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7988280/should-you-be-drinking-water-first-thing-in-the-morning/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;down that first glass of water&lt;/a&gt; and fuel up with breakfast (preferably &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfast-foods-to-help-you-poop-that-arent-oatmeal-8708873" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;one that helps you poop&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-factors-that-can-impact-how-often-and-when-you-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8 Factors That Can Impact How Often and When You Poop &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The simple act of eating, especially consuming a high-fiber meal, stimulates our intestines into action, says Bulsiewicz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other dietary factors also come into play. “Maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/healthiest-habit-to-do-before-9-am-11719250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate hydration&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for soft, easy-to-pass stools. Dehydration can lead to the colon absorbing more water from stool, resulting in harder, drier stools and potential constipation,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine, alcohol and other substances can boost bowel movements by stimulating colon contractions and increasing gut motility, while a diet that’s high in processed foods and low in fiber can contribute to constipation, adds Brown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Physical Activity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get going—and your gut will, too. “While we’re actually engaged in cardiovascular exercise, our gut motility typically slows down temporarily, only to rebound when we stop exercising,” says Bulsiewicz. “Exercise stimulates motility, which can help you have a bowel movement. When you move, your bowels move."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The reverse is also true: Lack of physical activity can slow gut motility and contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030662/normal-reasons-youre-constipated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Prolonged sitting can also place undue pressure on the rectum. According to Brown, over time, this can weaken the muscles involved in pooping. And those muscles need to function well for a full, complete BM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Traveling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a 2024 Instagram post, Bulsiewicz clued us in about the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013627/reasons-why-you-cant-poop-when-traveling/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 reasons why you can't poop when traveling&lt;/a&gt;. This is a common challenge, the doctors agree, due to the way time zone shifts affect our circadian rhythms, changes in diet and water intake, increased stress and the possibility of less activity while traveling (those tarmac delays and long flights are brutal for more than one reason).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 1 in 3 American adults report experiencing “completely overwhelming” amounts of stress on most days, according to a 2023 Stress in America survey by the American Psychological Association.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  This is messing with our perspective on the world, of course, as well as how often and when we poop. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Stress and anxiety impact the gut-brain axis, leading to alterations in bowel habits. Stress can increase colon contractions, causing diarrhea &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; reduce gut motility, resulting in constipation,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How your gut reacts to stress depends on your own physiology and the hormones your body pumps out (like cortisol or adrenaline) when you’re feeling flustered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 5. Certain Health Conditions &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides those mental challenges, other health issues can affect bowel movements, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt;, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, says Brown. These medical conditions can increase or decrease the frequency with which you poop.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over-the-counter meds like laxatives and stool softeners are designed to enhance bowel movements or facilitate easier stool passage. Other prescriptions, including some antidepressants, as well as certain narcotics, including opioids, may lead to constipation, since they reduce intestinal secretions and slow gut motility, according to Brown. If you’ve started a new medication and notice that your bathroom habits have changed, talk to a health care provider—they may be able to adjust your medication or provide recommendations to help get things moving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 7. Pregnancy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carrying a kiddo stacks the deck against regularity. A growing fetus places pressure on the rectum, potentially hindering bowel movements. In addition, “Pregnancy-related hormonal shifts can reduce gut motility, causing constipation,” says Brown. “Increased progesterone levels can relax digestive tract muscles, hindering stool movement through the colon."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 8. Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our digestive system naturally slows down as we age, leading to less frequent bowel movements, explains Brown. Most of us start to move a little less as we get up there in years, and as already mentioned, lower levels of activity make people of any age more likely to poop less frequently. Plus, with age, all of our muscles—including those in the colon and rectum—generally weaken. This can increase the risk of constipation. And, according to Brown, our nerves become less sensitive, too, including those within the rectum, making it challenging to sense the urge for a bowel movement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fine-tuning your lifestyle can help you poop comfortably and like clockwork. Remember that everyone will respond differently to the following adjustments, and if you’re dealing with diarrhea or constipation for more than two weeks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(or if either are painful or severe for shorter times than that), talk to a health care provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To stay more regular, follow these expert-approved tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create consistent morning habits. &lt;/strong&gt;This starts with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921626/what-i-did-for-one-week-for-better-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a regular sleep-and-wake schedule and allowing your body to charge up with some outdoor light exposure soon after you rise, recommends Bulsiewicz. As part of this kick-start, consider a cup of morning Joe, since coffee can help stimulate a bowel movement. “Pair this with a high-fiber breakfast to set yourself up for success," says Bulsiewicz. Doing this every day helps to synchronize your body's internal clock with your digestive system, prompting more regular bowel movements, adds Brown.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take time to train your body to poop in a timely manner. &lt;/strong&gt;Morning is often the most natural time for our bowels and our personal preferences (we don’t know about you, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836695/why-your-body-only-wants-to-poop-at-home-according-to-a-doctor/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pooping at the office&lt;/a&gt; is not our fave). And get this—you can actually “coach” your colon into being about as predictable as your alarm clock. “Teach your body to poop at a specific time by sitting on the toilet for five minutes after you have your morning coffee and breakfast,” says Bulsiewicz. Once there, don’t strain or force it, and if after five minutes you’re not actively pooping, get up and leave. “But if you repeat this process a few days in a row, your body will recognize that you’re trying to poop at that time and will help you make it possible,” he adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in regular physical activity. &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing, playing tennis or hiking all count. Then try to sneak in a few more physical activity “snacks” throughout the day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or heading out for a two- to five-minute walk after meals. The latter can be a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boon for your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim to meet your fiber quota each day. &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber in general adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass through the colon. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for America promote eating about 30 grams of fiber per day, depending on age and sex.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not quite hitting that mark, gradually increase your fiber intake to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048994/does-fiber-make-you-gassy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bloating and gas&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds are all solid sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948091/why-drinking-water-all-day-long-is-not-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;No need to chug&lt;/a&gt;, but try to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;drink plenty of water&lt;/a&gt; and feast on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. “Sufficient hydration is crucial for maintaining soft, easy-to-pass stools,” says Brown. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek out stress-relievers. &lt;/strong&gt;“By &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; and practicing relaxation techniques, you can regulate bowel movements and promote a sense of calm,” says Brown. Near the toilet, try to foster a relaxing environment when using the bathroom (a pretty painting or a plant can’t hurt) and avoid rushing or straining during bowel movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider a magnesium supplement. &lt;/strong&gt;Bulsiewicz suggests that after all of these steps, if you find that you struggle with constipation on any level, ask your doctor if a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-constipation-recommended-by-gastroenterologist-8419895" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="9"&gt;magnesium supplement&lt;/a&gt; might be a good fit for you. “Typically magnesium oxide, sulfate or citrate are good for stimulating a bowel movement, and the ideal time to take them for a healthy morning poo is before bed. Magnesium is also helpful for sleep,” says Bulsiewicz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The most important thing is that you poop with adequate regularity to keep things from backing up. Although a daily bowel movement may be a great way to accomplish this, it’s not a requirement to achieve my goal of adequate regularity,” says Bulsiewicz. “Additionally, there are many, many people who poop everyday and are still constipated. If you’re not completely emptying, then a small little daily nugget may not be adequate! So for me, I’m more interested in making sure it’s adequate rather than rigidly adhering to a specific frequency."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your typical “normal” has changed and you’re suddenly pooping way more or less or the consistency is radically different, those are all cues to talk to a health care practitioner to make sure everything is good with your gut and overall health.

&lt;p&gt;Regular bowel movements, no matter what time of day they occur, play a vital role in maintaining gut health and preventing issues like constipation or fecal impaction, according to Brown. While our bodies are naturally primed for bowel movements in the morning, the most important thing is that you're going regularly, no matter what time it is. “Regardless of the time of day, it’s crucial to pay attention to your body's signals and not ignore the urge to have a bowel movement,” says Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting your lifestyle to promote an A.M. poop is possible. Drink plenty of water, consume a high-fiber diet, aim to reduce stress and create a consistent sleep-and-wake schedule. Soon after you wake up, eat a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7913071/high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich breakfast&lt;/a&gt; and drink a cup of coffee or tea, then sit on the toilet for five minutes.

&lt;p&gt;From a scientific perspective, there is no single "correct" frequency for bowel movements, says Brown. What’s “normal” can vary from about two times per day to three times per week. As long as your stools are well-formed and easy to pass, and the schedule doesn't cause discomfort, any time is A-OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to poop is in the morning, and you can make that happen by creating a solid poop-friendly A.M. routine with a fiber-rich breakfast, some water and coffee and a consistent time on the toilet. That said, each of us is unique, and what may be a “normal” bowel movement pattern can vary from person to person.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Keep a keen eye on any sudden or persistent changes in bowel habits and consult a health care provider to address any concerns. By doing so, you will optimize your digestive health and overall well-being,” advises Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the age when a child’s period begins, called menarche, can tell them a little about their health later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Menarche that begins “anytime between the age of 10 and 14 is considered normal,” Dr. Anne-Marie Amies Oelschlager, pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. “The average age in the U.S. most recently has been around age 12. But in some recent studies, it has actually dipped even to 11.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most American girls, 98%, will start their periods by age 15, she adds. Children who start periods at a younger age within the normal range can experience some “adverse effects long term.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ideally, you want your period to come in the typical range,” says Amies Oelschlager, a fellow with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the most part, girls start their period about the same age their mothers did and there’s not much they can do to change this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The most common reason for getting an earlier period is familial. So, if your mother or your older sister had an earlier period then you’re likely going to have it (early) also,” Dr. Adi Davidov, associate chair of OB/GYN at Staten Island University Hospital, tells TODAY.com. “There are probably some environmental factors that really are not very clear.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead, the experts share how the age of one’s first period impacts future health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-cc7e7c" class="body-heading"&gt;Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who start their periods at a younger age have an increased risk for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Menarche or first period at age 11 or lower was associated with a higher risk for any cancer,” Amies Oelschlager says. “But particularly those (cancers) that are hormonally sensitive, like breast and endometrial cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors are unsure why starting one’s period at 10, for example, might lead to increased cancer risk but they have some theories, especially as it relates to hormone-driven cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When a girl develops menarche earlier in life, she’s exposed to higher levels of female hormones earlier and life and prolonged exposure to female hormones can cause some of these diseases,” Davidov says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Amies Oelschlager says research hasn’t found a “clear cause” for why cancer risk increases but agrees that when it comes to breast and endometrial cancers, experiencing more years of hormones could be at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The question is — is there something about having a longer duration of estrogen exposure over time,” she says. “Your estrogen levels really increase with puberty and then stay pretty elevated until the age of menopause. So having the longer timer period of higher levels of estrogen is that, by itself, a risk factor?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ovulation also comes with a spike in progesterone levels and perhaps that could contribute to some types of breast cancer, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Is it just unique to these higher levels of estrogen or progesterone for longer time periods?” Amies Oelschlager says. “Or is it possible that there may be other things that are triggering early puberty, like endocrine disruptors that are … causing changes in the breast tissue that can increase your risk of breast cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Natural or synthetic chemicals that disturb the endocrine system are called &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine" target="_blank"&gt;endocrine disrupters&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9a999c" class="body-heading"&gt;Insulin resistance and metabolic disorder &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; occurs when the body doesn’t properly react to insulin, a hormone the pancreas produces, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease. This inability to respond to insulin means people can experience increased blood sugar levels and gain weight. If left unaddressed, it causes people to develop Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are some (studies) that have shown earlier puberty has been associated with higher insulin resistance and what we would call metabolic disorders,” Amies Oelschlager says. “It’s not totally clear if it’s just the early period or if it’s related to body mass index (BMI).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to tease out the relationship between BMI, early periods and metabolic disorders. A higher BMI can lead to people starting their periods earlier because adipose tissue, body fat, produces estrone, a type of estrogen. And, a higher BMI can cause insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Right now, it's unclear whether BMI or the date of a first period contributes to these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, there’s an association between having an earlier first period and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We know that girls that start their (puberty and periods) early are at a higher risk for diabetes when they’re younger,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the ovaries control the menstrual part of puberty, the adrenal glands control other aspects of puberty such as the development of pubic hair and body odor. Sometimes one puberty starts before the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They don’t always go in sync,” Amies Oelschlager says. “Those puberties can start earlier or later. So, some girls may have signs of early onset of the pubic hair and the adrenal type of puberty and those can be associated with … an increased risk for diabetes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-605081" class="body-heading"&gt;Heart disease &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The research on when one starts their period and its relationship to later heart health remains murky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s been studies that have shown that an early period, before age 11 or lower, was associated with higher blood pressure levels,” Amies Oelschlager says. “But it’s not totally clear if it’s just the early period or if it is related to body mass index because an elevated body mass index also increases your risk for higher blood pressure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Davidov says he has also seen research indicating that the timing of one’s first period — both early or late — could be connected to heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Anything that’s not exactly the norm, a little bit earlier, a little bit later, may potentially increase your risk of heart disease,” he says. “Honestly, it’s not clear to me what the underlying mechanism is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the problems is that it can be difficult to study the impact of one’s first period on future health, such as heart disease. Many factors likely contribute to heart health troubles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(Studies are) retrospective in nature,” Davidov says. “There (are) so many confounding variables that it’s very hard to determine the actual causes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For example, perhaps a woman with a slightly early first period had a health condition that caused it. That health condition could also contribute to a later diagnosis of heart disease. Also, lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, stress, obesity or sedentary lifestyles contribute to poor heart health and it can be difficult to tease out how much of a role early menarche plays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;While more research is needed, Amies Oelschlager encourages her patients who start their periods early to eat healthy and work out. Regular exercise can help people “decrease their risk of having those other metabolic, cardiovascular issues,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:33:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPQWh3NHI4bnFQZ3ZENFZtYjdxX3JLUkFaM2dIM3FzWkFJU09nQTFZOV83WFNCeVNuYXdUQUZBZlF5MlFIeDZLY0pUYlVZb0J1NzlBUFRXTW5VYlh3YmVNMlRUNjFvYTczQm9VY0Fqc1BvTUxqR1JEYk85cUxHT0NMaUNBM1FwSnR6RC1ab29mUFhzTmvSAVRBVV95cUxONmVtejl1NVFPQl9wNGwxUm9iWURSYkpHdEJQQTVMbmlMa0hXcHlWRjFKTTN5X0RPZHU4V1MwQUkzU25zYS1IYV81MlNGZnpJOXU3dkc</guid></item><item><title>随着Moderna报告取得积极成果， RFK Jr.为大流行疫苗提供资金- Ars Technica | RFK Jr. yanks pandemic vaccine funding as Moderna reports positive results - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPaVhMMUN1ZWhEZnlTUjlXUllUSjMzeHNOYUtrWFlXRXUtV3BYZFVJUE10V3EzcjNTZnhHWGJxREVEd0dEWHllTGFGMkRPdUw2SmFuTldfMjFIR1JDaVlVMjBaYUxkejY1b2JSUEN6bkV6dVcxMmZrZm8xNWJKM0xTOFpDcXVkeGV3ejVhODJJeTA1Smd5ZkRRdFNVNDlKMVBoNW5IN2lvTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services—under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F.

In the administration's final days in January, HHS awarded the vaccine maker an additional &lt;a href="https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx"&gt;$590 million&lt;/a&gt; to support "late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccines." The funding would also go to the development of five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, as news broke that the Trump administration was reneging on the contract, &lt;a href="a%20rapid,%20potent%20and%20durable%20immune%20response."&gt;Moderna reported positive&lt;/a&gt; results from an early trial of a vaccine targeting H5 influenza viruses. In a preliminary trial of 300 healthy adults, the vaccine candidate appeared safe and boosted antibody levels against the virus by 44.5-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson said that the decision to cancel the funding—which would support thorough safety and efficacy testing of the vaccines—was because the vaccines needed more testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not simply about efficacy—it’s about safety, integrity, and trust." HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/hhs-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine-funding/"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. "The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon went on to claim that the Trump administration wouldn't repeat the "mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns." The accusation refers to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed and initially released under the first Trump administration. They have since been proven safe and effective against the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not a medical disaster. It is a bodily process, like giving birth or like going to the bathroom or coughing,” she continues. “Your body knows what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She’ll eat and drink less, for example, and sleep a lot more; she won’t get out of bed and might become delirious. Eventually, her breathing will slow down until the death rattles take over. She might even experience “the rally”, the nurse says, or a burst of energy and mental clarity days before her last breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scene is based on real events in the life of Molly Kochan, who received a &lt;a href="https://everythingleadstothis.com/2015/08/12/everything-leads-to-this/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminal breast cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and embarked on a sexual journey until her death four years later. Kochan, who died at age 46, documented her experiences in a &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3zzOFMwPlA0bbPkt4R0Lku" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with her best friend, Nikki Boyer, which inspired the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b4a99c13-b22b-480c-b1cb-8283c0505284" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m a death expert.

It feels too scary or sad,” says Kim Rosenstock, the show’s co-creator, writer and executive producer. “So we felt like we had an opportunity to depict death in a different way. And in doing so, to hopefully make death feel even a tiny bit less mysterious and scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To some extent, each death is unique because it depends on a person’s age, health status and reason for dying, says Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse and online educator in Los Angeles, California. But for those unaffected by a traumatic event, such as a car accident, most people will experience certain stages and symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say that knowing more about death – which they call “death literacy” – can actually help quell fears of dying. Here’s what they said about the science and psychology of the death process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-transition-phase" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The transition phase&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Months before death, the transition phase begins, says McFadden. This entails spending more time in bed, eating and drinking less, and needing more help with daily tasks such as getting dressed and going to the bathroom. During this time, it can be hard to keep up with conversations and sleep will take up most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This stage can be particularly difficult to notice in people who have conditions such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease, adds McFadden, because the signs mirror those of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The transition phase could also involve a “detachment from the world” in a way that makes time feel non-existent, says &lt;a href="https://coleimperi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cole Imperi&lt;/a&gt;, a certified thanatologist, a specialist who studies death, dying, grief and loss. Senses will begin to dull as well, she says, so sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch won’t be as intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Due to a lower food and beverage intake, at this point it’s possible to enter ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose. Imperi says some people may experience pain relief or euphoria as a result, but it’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987706005779" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not entirely clear why&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2722878/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the neurotransmitter Gaba increases during ketosis, which makes you feel calm, while cortisol, the stress hormone, decreases, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="active-dying" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Active dying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these symptoms will worsen until the last stage of life, called “active dying”, says McFadden. This can begin a few days or hours before death. For the most part, a person is unconscious, she says, and breathing and heart rate can become irregular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If respiration or heart rate becomes too erratic and causes discomfort, hospice workers can bring in a music-thanatologist to help stabilize vitals and ease anxiety, says Imperi. These trained professionals play the harp and use their voice at bedside. “When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork,” says Imperi, “so when music-thanatologists come in, the body sort of tethers itself to the pattern of their music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About a third of dying people undergo this sudden rush of mental clarity shortly before they die, according to McFadden. For a brief couple of days, hours or even minutes, personalities return, loved ones’ names are remembered and favorite foods are craved yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s not a definitive scientific reason why this happens,” says Imperi. “But I will say that it is a beautiful, beautiful gift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also very common, at any point during active dying, to experience hallucinations or visions that typically involve loved ones who have passed. Imperi says dying people often talk about needing to pack their suitcase or waiting to be picked up at an airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="terminal-secretions-or-the-death-rattle" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Terminal secretions, or the ‘death rattle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The last thing that happens before death is a change in breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes respiration, says Imperi. Like a fish out of water, a person experiences a series of rapid breaths followed by long periods of no breathing. As a result, one can’t swallow mucus or saliva, so it thickens and builds up in the back of the throat, making each breath sound a bit gurgly, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These noises are called terminal secretions, commonly referred to as the “death rattle”. Although it sounds painful, Cheyne-Stokes breathing doesn’t hurt – just like most of the active dying process, says McFadden, who says she can tell based on patients’ non-verbal cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dying person is like a baby,” McFadden says. “Babies can’t say they’re hungry or teething, but you can tell something is wrong by how they’re acting. Dying people are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-death-literacy-is-important" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why death literacy is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In American culture, death is largely feared and seen as this disaster to avoid at all costs,” says Rosenstock. “It was important to us to convey the dying process in a truthful way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s normal to be scared of death because it’s in our nature to survive, says Imperi, but the best way to quash a fear of dying is to educate yourself. Several &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82421-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the more we learn about and contemplate death, the less anxiety we have about experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Death literacy can be especially helpful for people who are already dying, McFadden says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":32,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Dying for Sex review – Michelle Williams’ erotic journey is revolutionary TV","elementId":"0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most people are not comfortable talking about it, so everyone skirts around the issue. But at the end of the day, they do want answers, and generally speaking, we have some,” McFadden says. “We don’t know exactly what it’s going to be like after you’re gone, but we know enough about what you can expect [during the process], and in most cases, my patients and their families sigh with relief once they learn more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s because one of the hardest parts about dying is losing control, says Imperi, and death education can help put the ball back in your court. On the other hand, some people might find a sense of control by refusing to learn more about what’s happening to them or their loved one, adds Imperi, which can be equally as therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Supporting that resistance is sometimes more important,” says Imperi, because that might be what a person needs at that point in their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Above all, “we are built for death just like we’re built for birth”, says McFadden. “The more we understand that, the better we will live – and the more peaceful we will die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13bnFrWEg2RVV3QXRxZlV1SHM5ME1OVlIyaS1ZODZ5X1ZpRERKdWpaNFkwVTk5Vnlyb1BMVUhFcGpnSF9NMjUtVHFyd2VOMHRELTA2a2Rjei12WjhibXlaTGZMU2tyMXJpN3VDa1IyckFqMldVVkJBYVF3WmpMSVU</guid></item><item><title>瘫痪后生孩子的妈妈-伤口 | The Mom Who Had a Baby After Becoming Paralyzed - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQRllJcktXRkgzOWlkNkswWmNPT0wxT3hnZFcxV2V3VlZ3aEdmbDlMcF9pdmRIUEdWa3AycmxWZWNfLUtZRzlVQU9hSDhUM1RoOFYwZXJ6UmZUNmFWWDZQdThwRXk3djR1aG11MVI1dVZFUzBBOXNhNVNVZ1JvaE13S0hZQU5BZ1JHbm5IMkVGbTZ3cHc0Ym1EdzVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

But “every patient with a spinal-cord injury is unique,” Charlotte says. Her specialists told her there was a chance that the communication between her legs and her brain could be restored, and that she could get some degree of mobility or sensation back. About six months after her injury, Charlotte surprised herself — and her specialists — when she discovered she could feel and move her toes. “I was sitting in the shower and my toes suddenly wiggled,” she remembers. At first the movement was inadvertent, but then she found she could do it again, on purpose. “It wasn’t a spasm,” Charlotte says. “I was in disbelief.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mma3z003f3b6d6jg0355y@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With additional rehab, Charlotte learned how to rise into a standing position and, slowly and haltingly, take a few steps. Still, for a young adult in her prime, and a former college swimmer, the adjustment to her new limitations was brutal, physically and emotionally. In the beginning of her recovery, tasks she had once considered mindless were huge challenges. “You can imagine how hard it is to put pants on in a seated position,” Charlotte says. “Before I learned how to do that, I’d be rolling around on the bed for ten minutes, trying to put underwear on.” Navigating an ableist world not designed for wheelchair users was a major shock to the system: “Something as simple as getting around a hose somebody left out in the sidewalk to water their lawn, that was hard for me, especially as I was getting used to my chair.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mm0b5002p3b6dhchdc3w6@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I definitely grieved, and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/grief-quotes-to-share.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;grieving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; took a long time,” Charlotte adds. “I’ve always been a confident person, someone who believed I could do anything. But back then, in the early days of my recovery, I found myself suddenly worrying about all of the potential things I may never be able to do.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mm0b5002q3b6doc884kf9@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s why Charlotte was relieved when a doctor assured her that the injury wasn’t likely to impede her ability to have children someday. Her reproductive organs hadn’t been affected by the accident, he said. With those reassuring words, the knot in Charlotte’s chest loosened. “It felt like a glimmer of hope,” says Charlotte. “I wasn’t anywhere near ready to have a family — I wasn’t even dating anyone seriously,” she says. “But I knew I wanted kids. I helped raise my younger siblings, who are a lot younger than I am, by ten and 12 years. I was a camp counselor, a coach. As a kid, I used to tell people I wanted at least five children. It felt nonnegotiable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Charlotte, now 41, reveals how her dream of becoming a mother came true. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000m0iikj4xcaas0@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;A year or so after the accident, I was like&lt;em&gt;, Let’s get back out there and start dating&lt;/em&gt;. At first I just went about my life, trying to meet people organically while getting groceries or going to the park or the pool. When that bombed, I decided to try online dating. Right away, I think I felt more secure, being able to write my little synopsis and put my profile up, and sort of screen people in or out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mposf006e3b6dyaw7tcr0@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;For a while I didn’t write anything about my injury. I’d talk to guys for a couple of weeks before deciding when to share. I’m picky, so I didn’t get to that point with a lot of people. But when I did, there was a mix of reactions. Some guys were like, “Okay, good to know.” But other ones weren’t as nice. This one guy — I should’ve saved the screenshot — wrote back “I don’t know if I can do all that,” to which I was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, good-bye.&lt;/em&gt; Obviously he wasn’t the one.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000o0iikb94z4j7h@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;I kept tweaking my profile, then decided to be fully transparent about my injury. Being guarded wasn’t helping me meet better guys; if anything it was making it harder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006m3b6dil4p6ra0@published" data-word-count="41"&gt;After a while, online dating got old. I’d been doing it for a couple of years when one of my app subscriptions was about to end.  I decided that when the time was up, I was going to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006n3b6d1k9eetr3@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;Then I got this little ping from this guy — Mark. I checked him out, and I couldn’t believe it. He was funny, handsome. Suddenly I was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, this might be someone I want to meet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006o3b6db5af31rk@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;We started talking, and there was chemistry. He made me laugh, and we never ran out of stuff to talk about. We moved the conversation to email, and we would write to each other all day, sometimes till 2 a.m. I didn’t want to get my hopes up, but it felt like something was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006p3b6dnlyimvii@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;We decided to meet for a first date. I was definitely nervous; I had him meet me at my friend’s café so she could back me up if he did anything weird. We talked over coffee and a sandwich, and I really liked him. He was genuine, super-smart, really funny. We had the same silly sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000q0iikw6qf8bkn@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;I proceeded in the relationship with caution, and so did he — he’d been married before, had a 4-year-old son, and had only recently gotten divorced. But I think we both fell pretty hard, and at some point, I knew he was it for me. I was clear with him that the clock was ticking — I was in my 30s and wanted to have a baby. He was still licking his wounds, though, and needed time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mqwos006w3b6dltrv5lhp@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;But five years in, he proposed. I knew I wanted to walk to my husband and stand for our first dance, so I got back in touch with the first physical therapist who worked with me after I regained sensation. It was a really emotional day, but I did manage to walk down the aisle at the wedding with the help of my walker and leg braces.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mrcsf00793b6dpelkiucu@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;My husband and I had decided not to have sex until we were engaged — but we talked about it a lot before we did it for the first time. Mark had a ton of questions: Do we need any accommodation? Is anything going to be painful for you? Do you need an extra pillow here or there? He was totally concerned with my comfort, which is totally him. We didn’t take ourselves too seriously. I think that’s honestly the key with everything for us, just keeping things light.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8msbtb007g3b6de99et0d8@published" data-word-count="31"&gt;Clearly we figured it out. I went off birth control after our wedding, and less than a year later, I got pregnant. We were both shocked by how quickly it happened.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mz4ov007t3b6dm8f0zl6v@published" data-word-count="116"&gt;Even before I got pregnant, I’d been talking about the prospect of it with my general practitioner. She linked me up with a great high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist. People with spinal-cord injuries are more susceptible to UTIs and blood clots when they’re pregnant, so my doctor put me on low-dose, prophylactic antibiotics to protect against infection as well as a daily blood thinner shot in my belly to stave off clots. It was important for me to move around as much as I could throughout the day too. Thankfully, I work remotely, so I would step away from my desk a few times a day to walk with my walker and my braces down the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzb7s00803b6dkfqb8vo7@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;I wasn’t prepared for the extreme nausea I had for the whole nine months. It wasn’t hyperemesis gravidarum, because I wouldn’t vomit. I was just miserably sick — I could barely eat, and I lost so much weight. I was also covered in bruises — my whole abdomen was bruised from the blood-thinner injections. And in the sixth month, I developed gestational diabetes.The whole experience was exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzp0i008d3b6dlz1lwbww@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;Throughout the pregnancy, I worried about losing the baby. Specifically, I worried that I would miscarry and not know it. I developed bad anxiety over it, to the point that I bought my own doppler to listen to the baby’s heartbeat at home. I was taking a lot of meds — my usual anti-spasm medications, which I take to prevent dangerous muscle spasms that can interfere with things like driving or transferring from one position to another. I worried the meds would affect the baby, even though my MFM and my physiatrist — my spinal-cord injury specialist — insisted there was nothing to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzuqm008k3b6dcm0zhsve@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;It was endlessly relieving that every time I went in for a checkup, the baby looked great. She was growing well and had enough fluid and a strong heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzuqm008l3b6dz66z3v2m@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;And I could feel her. When I got pregnant, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to, but at about 19 weeks, there she was — a little flutter. I have a couple of videos of her doing a complete 180 in my stomach. That was a happy surprise, that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n07v3008y3b6dsdh9wg72@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;The pregnancy happened to coincide with a big move for us. We’d been in a two-bedroom apartment and knew we’d need a one-level house with at least three bedrooms — one for my stepson and another for the baby. We found one right around the time we found out I was pregnant and closed on it when I was two months along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n0dbo00953b6di0gc66qx@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;Accessibility was top of mind. We planned to have the baby sleep in our room, in a bedside bassinet, for most of her first year, then move into a crib in her room. I was concerned about being able to transfer her in and out of her crib from my chair. We ended up adapting a conventional crib by adding a sliding door.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n0t2k009i3b6ddq62e7aq@published" data-word-count="100"&gt;Spinal-cord-injury patients can experience a rare but potentially dangerous condition during labor. It’s called autonomic dysreflexia, and it happens when painful stimuli below your spinal cord injury trigger a central-nervous-system reaction that can make your heart rate go crazy, among other problems. I wanted to try for a vaginal birth regardless, and my doctors said I could do so with a few precautions. Specifically, rather than waiting to go into labor, I would have to have an induction so they could control my labor more tightly. About a month from my due date, we scheduled the induction for 39 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ij009p3b6dkpq945xz@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;My OB and I talked a lot about what was going to happen during labor. I was a little nervous that my injury would prevent me from pushing hard enough, and we talked about the possibility that the doctors would have to intervene with suction or forceps. They assured me that the baby wouldn’t be harmed. I didn’t like the idea, but I accepted that it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ik009q3b6dvejty45q@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;But once labor actually began, it felt like my body kicked in and did what it was born to do. About 12 hours after they started my induction, I began having strong contractions. I had an epidural — I have very minimal sensation below my injury, but they wanted to prevent dysreflexia, which is why they gave it to me. But I did feel strong pressure, and I definitely felt like I was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ik009r3b6diy35btss@published" data-word-count="39"&gt;About 15 hours after my induction began, my daughter arrived. She was little — five pounds, 15 ounces — but perfect, with thick black hair and big brown eyes. It was love at first sight. We named her Maya.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n1jzz00a43b6dscne98cp@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;Before Maya was born, I started following a lot of other wheelchair moms online and learned a lot of their tricks. I used a baby carrier a lot. I’d roll around the house with Maya strapped to my chest. As Maya got bigger and developed head control, I was able to secure her to my lap with a specialized, wide Velcro belt. To get her in and out of the car, I’d put her in her car seat, then put the car seat on my lap and roll out the door. We got a beautiful revolving car seat that spins to forward-facing or rear-facing, and that was super-helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n1r8g00ab3b6datu2jvmx@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;I didn’t expect to feel lonely, but I really did. It was the middle of the pandemic, so people just weren’t gathering together yet. My husband is wonderful, but it was just the two of us. We were sleep deprived and still having to be functional parents to my stepson, and I was extra emotional with all the hormones. I nursed Maya, but it didn’t come easily, which affected my ability to bond with her. It took a few months for that distant feeling to go away.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n25i100ao3b6dn983o2bx@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;At first I was pretty nervous about being out and about with my baby by myself. When she was still a newborn, we took a family vacation to spend time with relatives on a lake. A conflict came up with work for Mark, so I decided to make the four-hour drive with the baby by myself. I was so freaking scared, but I planned everything perfectly. It can be hard to find accessible parking and accessible bathrooms when you’re on a road trip, so before we left, I mapped out a bunch of stops and made sure we had all the gear we needed. When we made it, I was so proud. Since then, May and I have taken several other four- to six-hour drives by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3h7o00bf3b6dv7ycvjxa@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;More and more, I’ve leaned into my friendships with other spinal-cord-injury moms. I know four others now — women I connected with through some of the doctors we share, who are all in the D.C. area and have two or three kids apiece. I’m able to talk to them totally openly, and I go to them often for advice and help with problems. Now that Maya is 4, I talk to them a lot about how to be mobile when she and I are out and about by ourselves. Maya usually listens, but I still harbor a fear that she’ll bolt across a parking lot or something and I won’t be able to catch her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3qnb00bm3b6d6iikgsg4@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;One of my friends, who flies solo a lot with her two littlest kids, told me she uses backpacks with tethers on them. In a crowded airport, for example, she’ll tie the tethers to her chair. Maya has a similar backpack now, and we’ve used it a few times when I knew we were going to be in crowded places. It’s not something we do all the time — but sometimes that sort of solution is necessary to keep us safe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3qnb00bn3b6dv0pm3lwg@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;I still have anxiety around taking her to playgrounds by myself, as they’re not always wheel-friendly. There’s often sand or wood chips to navigate.  Usually we do playground time when I know someone else, like my husband, can tag along with us.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n42g400c03b6drdaanfg1@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Maya is in preschool, and she’s starting to notice differences and ask more questions. Lately, she’s been asking a lot about why I use a wheelchair. I just tell her that her mama’s legs don’t work as well as other people’s do, so I use my wheels to get around. She seems satisfied with that. As she gets older and more mature, I’ll share more about the accident and the injury in an age-appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n4ahj00c73b6dqxlr3har@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;Sometimes it makes me a little bit sad that she doesn’t have other friends at school with parents on wheels. She hasn’t voiced this, but I worry that someday she’ll think something is “wrong” with me, or that she’ll be bullied because her mom is different. I make a big effort to visit her school as much as possible to show her and her classmates that my wheels don’t stop me from doing anything, and that I’m just as involved and capable as the other parents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n4ahk00c83b6dxdjwy2kq@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;But preschooler parenting is tough! Maya is strong-willed. Sometimes she gets herself into spots around the house that she knows I can’t access in my chair. I’ll be trying to get her into the bath or discipline her but won’t be able to reach her. That’s definitely frustrating. But it’s also life with a preschooler.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/should-the-nausea-drug-zofran-be-over-the-counter.html"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; was beyond debilitating. Dealing with that, plus taking the blood-thinner shots and all of the other pills I was on, was a lot. I have no desire to potentially go through any of that again.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers collaborated to simulate how vesicles—tiny sacs that release neurotransmitters—operate within synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model reveals how proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate the recycling of vesicles, enabling synaptic transmission even at high firing rates. This breakthrough clarifies a long-standing mystery in neuroscience and opens the door to better understanding of diseases like depression and myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vesicle Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 10–20% of vesicles are active at a time; the rest are stored in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate vesicle movement and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could aid treatments for disorders involving faulty synaptic transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;OIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we think, feel, remember, or move? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These processes involve synaptic transmission, in which chemical signals are transmitted between nerve cells using molecular containers called vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have successfully modeled the vesicle cycle in unprecedented detail, revealing new information about the way our brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110470"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This is an illustration of a vesicle." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, between researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, and the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), Germany, has applied a unique computational modeling system, which considers the complicated interplay of vesicles, their cellular environments, activities and interactions, to create a realistic picture of how vesicles support synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model predicts parameters of synaptic function that could not be tested experimentally in the past, opening new avenues in neuroscience investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent technological advances have enabled experimental scientists to capture increasing amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The challenge now lies in integrating and interpreting all the different types of data, to understand the complexities of the brain,” said Professor Erik De Schutter, head of the OIST Computational Neuroscience Unit and co-author on this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our model provides better molecular and spatial detail of the vesicle cycle, and much faster, than any other systems before. And it’s transferable to different cells and scenarios too. It’s a significant leap forward towards scientific aspirations of full cell and full tissue simulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working on synapses for over 20 years, but some functional steps were difficult to test experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After several years of fine-tuning experimental and computational work with our Japanese colleagues, we now have a model for testing new hypotheses, especially in the context of neurological diseases”, added Professor Silvio Rizzoli, director of the Department for Neuro- and Sensory Physiology at the UMG and also co-author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the synaptic vesicle cycle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vesicle cycle describes the steps through which neurotransmitters (chemical signals) are released at a synapse (a junction between nerve cells), to transfer information between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move and dock at the membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents, before being recycled. The process is prompted by electrical stimulation within the brain and is driven by a complex signaling cascade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, different amounts of neurotransmitters need to be released over different time periods. To enable controlled and sustained synaptic transmission, only 10-20% of vesicles are readily available to dock at any given time (these are known as the recycling pool). Most vesicles are instead in a reserve pool, immobilized in a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many details of this process, including how vesicles move between the reserve and recycling pool, were poorly known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mechanisms of vesicle recycling at high stimulation frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their publication, the researchers shed new light on the vesicle recycling process in hippocampal synapses. With their model, they aimed to both confirm the behavior of vesicles at experimentally-observed firing frequencies, and explore behavior at higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also able to pinpoint some of the reasons behind this robust cycle, identifying the roles of key proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 in regulating vesicle release from the clustered reserve pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the efficiency of the vesicle cycle relied on molecular tethering. By physically connecting some vesicles to the membrane with tethers, a close supply of vesicles could be made available for rapid docking and neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These important findings enable deeper understanding of vesicle recycling, a process involved in many different diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the release of neurotransmitters is hampered in botulism or some myasthenic syndromes. Treatments for depression and other major neurological diseases also often focus on synaptic transmission,” explained Prof. De Schutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we expand our models, the potential applications are vast, both in developing new therapeutics, and in deepening our fundamental understanding of how the brain works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3879c9e9c9e9add9c9886919cb39c9a8087dd9983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tomomi Okubo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://oist.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;OIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tomomi Okubo – OIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq6477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/a&gt;” by Erik De Schutter et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission is driven by a complex cycle of vesicle docking, release, and recycling, maintained by distinct vesicle pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the partitioning of vesicle pools and reserve pool recruitment remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a novel vesicle modeling technology to model the synaptic vesicle cycle in unprecedented molecular and spatial detail at a hippocampal synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE0zUVBGSlBEcFFTaXh1Rng0Z0FUbkxHU3VGX1E2S1Rvd3ZOcUVyUW00QXRna1VpdFNueHAtQVBkam03U1d2aVlIcm5PM1ZLQzE1alBNNU1pQzlQN0V1bm9rcDVrYTNQSEVmYVlR</guid></item></channel></rss>
