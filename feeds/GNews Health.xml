Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/covid-shot-access-coverage-at-stake-as-rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-meets-.html"&gt;vaccine committee&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to vote&lt;/a&gt; Thursday on whether to change a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/how-to-get-covid-mmrv-hepatitisb-vaccines.html"&gt;longstanding recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot entirely. The group&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt; tabled a vote &lt;/a&gt;on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But either change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that," Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;driving down infections in kids by 99%&lt;/a&gt; since then. Maniar called that a "remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing" if the committee changes the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;up to states&lt;/a&gt; to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-malone-cdc-vaccine-committee.html"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the jab is "an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks," Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine," said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;still recommends&lt;/a&gt; the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because "it saves lives," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK/"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt; manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Merck during the panel's September meeting pushed back on changing the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases," Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOY3ZHTS1jTXMwRnY3TnpFSmJScmhwN3djcWVtaFFoWU1JaHdSU3RtRnExdFJacnYtZlNudU1abVFVb2xEN1NxdmVyX1VCdHdncVQxcTFrdUUwZEZNSG9ZR3RJV1pENDFpVmNqQ3ZCRTAzX2o3Q283TmZ6U1pIcDAteNIBhgFBVV95cUxOV0pkckF3d2ZGODd1WVFUbjU4R3ltVjNZTFpIYlEzdW5MbXlMT2JYb3h4cmxQVGdVbUVBV1VQWUt1RTBRa3dMemJGU014STJ2OTNKWW9OYVRkWVZRUlV0bkhxREhsYWhNQkRXWUk3M3dscExVcTh5VHR0RzN6bXJrX2pON3ZUUQ</guid></item><item><title>法国确认回国旅客中有2例MERS冠状病毒病例- BNO新闻</title><link>https://bnonews.com/index.php/2025/12/france-confirms-2-mers-coronavirus-cases-in-returning-travelers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative"&gt;
														
&lt;p&gt;Two cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been confirmed in France in individuals who recently returned from travel abroad, according to the French Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said the infections were identified after both patients developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV and were found to have traveled together to the Arabian Peninsula, according to &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2025/12/04/deux-cas-de-coronavirus-mers-identifies-en-france-sur-des-personnes-de-retour-de-l-etranger_6655935_3244.html"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Minister Stéphanie Rist said the patients are being treated in the hospital as a precaution and that their conditions are stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rist said measures have been implemented to limit the risk of transmission, including contact tracing, testing, isolation, and precautionary steps for anyone who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bnone-in-content-4" id="bnone-286855448"&gt;&lt;div class="advert-block"&gt;
	&lt;span class="mvp-ad-label"&gt;Article continues below the player&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;p data-fuse="22691751352"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said no secondary transmission has been detected in France. Other individuals who took part in the same trip are being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MERS-CoV is a respiratory virus first identified in 2012 and is primarily associated with transmission from camels in countries on the Arabian Peninsula. Human-to-human spread can occur, particularly in healthcare settings, but sustained community transmission is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus causes severe respiratory illness in many cases, with symptoms that can include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. According to the World Health Organization, MERS has a high case-fatality rate compared to other coronaviruses, with about one-third of confirmed patients dying from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large outbreaks outside the Middle East have been rare but significant. In 2015, South Korea experienced a major hospital-associated outbreak linked to a traveler returning from the region, resulting in 186 cases and dozens of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemt9fz003k26p4gzkah67j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirty-eight-year-old Rosy Devi’s body aches most of the time, short walks have become difficult, she loses her breath easily, has chest pain and feels her health is generally getting worse. It has been a gradual decline, she says, since her hysterectomy in 2019 which led to her prematurely going through menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemvo5k00063b5zaxajejzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am walking and suddenly feel intense heat in my body and start sweating. And I get chest pain, like someone has hit me in the back,” says the mother of four who lives in India’s eastern state of Bihar. She never imagined the menopause, the time of life a woman stops getting her period permanently, would take such a toll on her body. “Now I am really feeling old. I mean, I feel that I have really become old… The body, the face, everything has changed,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000b3b5z6ibsi580@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Devi, menopause was also something she expected to experience much later in life, not because of surgery, so the whole thing came as quite a surprise, she admits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000c3b5zdyvvltkj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s a change that affects half the world’s population at some stage, and Devi’s symptoms are some of the wider-ranging and lesser-known effects that come with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000d3b5z0zad9tjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms such as hot flashes and mood changes are well known, and often stereotyped, but experts worldwide want to highlight that women face a huge range of changes to their bodies during the menopause – and lack of awareness means many will start experiencing symptoms without knowing why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000e3b5zdif95r6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what everyone needs to know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiemxuis000h3b5z8lhvoibf@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-is-menopause-and-why-dont-people-know-enough-about-it" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What is menopause – and why don’t people know enough about it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwlab00093b5zofja3xqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause is when women experience an end to their periods, or menstruation, for more than 12 months, and it marks the end of their reproductive years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000m3b5z4jgejo45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, most women experience menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But a study of women in the United States and South Korea found that up to 9.4% of people (around 1 in 10) experience it between 40 and 44, while for up to 8.6% of people it happens before the age of 40. In very rare cases, women can go through menopause as early as their 20s. For some, it can occur following a full hysterectomy, including the removal of the ovaries, or due to other medical reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000n3b5zp8jiuvr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of natural menopause, the first stage is perimenopause. This is when the ovaries gradually produce fewer hormones, affecting menstrual cycles. Symptoms include irregular periods, hot flashes (also known as hot flushes), sleep disruption and mood changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000o3b5zb4kk9yxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perimenopause can begin as early as in the mid-30s, lasting for about four to eight years, but many women can’t recall when this started for them, explains Gayathri Delanerolle, a researcher with Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. In qualitative interviews, some women remember the exact time they experienced a hot flash or their sleep began to get worse, but others have no idea, she tells CNN. “Menopause has not even been on the radar.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000p3b5zt66gk2dd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that most women know little about menopause. One, which surveyed more than 800 postmenopausal women, the majority based in the UK, found that over 90% of them had never been taught about menopause at school, and almost half said they felt completely uninformed about it. The women also shared that their doctors lacked adequate knowledge, leaving them feeling “dismissed and unsupported” after their consultations. Other studies produced similar findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000q3b5ziytnwyb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Joyce Harper, a professor at University College London’s Institute of Women’s Health, who co-authored the study, told the College news outlet, the result shows “women have a lack of education about this key life stage… Together with a reported lack of education from their healthcare professionals, women may be left undiagnosed and unsupported.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiemz1bs000s3b5znij9kccb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="menopause-can-happen-in-many-ways-and-at-different-times" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Menopause can happen in many ways and at different times
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemy8id000k3b5z384pis16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause is classified as “premature” when it occurs before age 40, and “early” before the age 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000x3b5zc3733n0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research suggests, across low and middle-income countries, rates of early and premature menopause have risen and that the average age of menopause has fallen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000y3b5zqozjwxti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you get menopause early in your lifespan, you are struggling with that for a longer period of time,” says Nikita Rajput, a scientific officer at Tata Memorial Centre’s Centre for Cancer Epidemiology in Navi Mumbai, India.  Her research found that women in rural India faced “limited healthcare access, low awareness and higher rates of premature menopause,” she tells CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000z3b5zvp50bxrc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other forms of menopause include surgical, which is triggered by a hysterectomy to remove the uterus and ovaries, and medical menopause, where treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy may affect the functioning of the ovaries and result in the onset of menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm00103b5zcbi1zcgr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health experts in India have raised concerns about high rates of premature and early menopause in the country with research indicating its link to hysterectomies. This is particularly the case among young women from low-income, less educated and rural backgrounds. Rajput tells CNN that when these women are suffering with gynaecological disorders such as excessive bleeding or fibroids, they feel forced into hysterectomies, possibly under pressure from their husband or in-laws, or even doctors who may suggest the surgery as the first course of action. Research shows many women are unaware of the extent of the procedures they’ve had.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemzcoj000v3b5ze9lt1xyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common symptoms of menopause are hot flashes and night sweats, occurring in 80% of cases, according to The Menopause Society in the US, but other common symptoms include vaginal dryness, urinary urgency, insomnia, and mood changes, including depression and irritability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x600193b5zfd3p6mjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Lots of women have also reported headaches, migraines…and difficulty sleeping or staying asleep,” says  Delanerolle. Many also experience incontinence which then impacts other aspects of their life, including work and exercising.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001a3b5zl3nm2mv6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, women may face symptoms such as heart palpitations, joint and muscle ache, changes in sex drive, poor concentration, weight gain and hair loss, according to the Mayo Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001b3b5zqviyxl8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other less common symptoms include dry eyes, while some women also report changes to their vision. They may also find themselves bruising more easily and suffer dry mouth or acne.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001c3b5zv5p3p8z3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delanerolle says she has come across other symptoms in her research, including itchy scalp and itchy skin. Some women in India and the UK even reported an increase in libido, she adds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001d3b5zokt3z7t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Menopause can be a highly individualized journey,” says Delanerolle, and because some symptoms are common in other health conditions, “sometimes it may not be possible to definitively think that these are related to menopause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001e3b5zykvwmby7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She believes what’s needed is comprehensive research, public awareness campaigns, including in schools, and evidence-based training for health care professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien0v9l00173b5zerpr15f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause and its symptoms last for around seven years on average, according to the Cleveland Clinic, and it’s important for women to be able to understand and identify what they are going through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001l3b5zjguv03qo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease following menopause, making it important that they become more active and manage their diet. This is because menopause causes a significant drop in estrogen – which works in regulating cholesterol and fat – increasing the risk of developing coronary heart disease or suffering a heart attack or stroke, according to the British Heart Foundation. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001m3b5zqc1asvp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple studies also show a greater risk of respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following menopause, particularly premature menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001n3b5zohkk4rvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Om Kurmi, associate professor in epidemiology and healthcare research at Coventry University in the UK, says greater awareness will help women get the correct support, and make the changes required in their lifestyle, to mitigate the health risks menopause brings with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001o3b5zqqtoumfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing exercise, reducing stress levels and losing weight can help with symptoms and combat the heightened risk of conditions such as osteoporosis and heart disease. Another area is mental health, which Kurmi says is “not discussed at all.” While symptoms of menopause such as irritability, mood swings and insomnia are well documented, there is also a heightened risk of depression and anxiety, as recent studies show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001p3b5z40ze311d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women “need to recognize, if you’re having menopause, the likelihood of having certain health problems is higher compared to those who don’t,” Kurmi tells CNN. “Once you understand your symptoms … (these) can be managed well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmien2l1m001t3b5zlgkmlrub@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="how-can-women-manage-menopause-symptoms-and-does-this-differ-globally" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        How can women manage menopause symptoms? And does this differ globally?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien1t00001j3b5zunyxz82t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most prescribed care option for menopause worldwide is hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy or HRT, which works by replacing the hormones that have decreased inside the body. One is estrogen therapy – typically given to women who have had hysterectomies – and a second type is a combination of the hormones estrogen and progesterone, offered to others. Hormone therapy is thought to help mitigate symptoms and risks associated with menopause, and treatment typically lasts between two to five years, sometimes even longer. Stopping treatment may bring back menopausal symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx001y3b5z5a1vvvao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these therapies are more available in high-income countries due to cost, access to health care services, and knowledge among practitioners to then prescribe it. However, disparity is also seen within high-income countries, with the financially better off tending to have greater access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx001z3b5z1eihpvz7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are some known side effects of hormone therapy, including irregular vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness, and an increased risk of blood clots and gall bladder disease. There is also a slight increase in the risk of breast, ovarian and endometrial (womb) cancer, but according to Cancer Research UK, the risk remains small, and depends on many factors, such as the type of therapy, how long someone is on it, their age and their general health and lifestyle. Experts saythat women should weigh all their options and decide, which can only happen if they have choices and information to hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx00203b5zwylojx8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are also medications which may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms, such as antidepressants to treat hot flashes. Many women prefer to take a more natural route, with several herbal supplements claiming to help manage symptoms like hot flashes and sleep disruption. However, these are not generally recommended by health authorities due to a lack of evidence as to their efficacy and safety. Other options include taking vitamin supplements and making lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, losing weight and regular exercise, which may be easier options for women in low-income settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx00213b5zsua7op6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of research from the US and five European countries found that most women who had moderate to severe symptoms made lifestyle changes to manage them. The most prescribed treatment was hormone therapy, followed by anti-depressants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx00223b5zwj0cv27h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the US, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;recent decision&lt;/a&gt; to remove “scary black box warning” labelling on HRT products may see more women choosing the treatment. The country’s Food and Drug Administration decided to remove the “black box” warning stating the increased risks of diseases like breast cancer and dementia, saying the move was “to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” according to the FDA Commissioner Dr Marty Makary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Why women (and men) and policymakers need to sit up and pay attention
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2uza001w3b5zg0hzrs3k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The population is increasing, the lifespan is increasing, and that means women, 50% of the global population, are increasing as well,” says Kurmi. And with women living longer than men, the UN’s World Population Prospects 2024 says there is a need to prioritize “gender-specific health care needs,” and build stronger “social support systems to mitigate potential caregiving burdens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq00293b5zxmzze2x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more women who “are over 40 years, 50 years nowadays,” Kurmi, who is part of a team of researchers looking at the urgent need for attention on menopause, tells CNN there will be an increase in menopause-related health issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq002a3b5znwwhok62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health services in many low and middle-income countries, like India, still focus most of their budget for women  on sexual and reproductive health, due to problems such as high maternal mortality rates, which the Indian government says is a “critical public health issue.” But a growing number of older women are also in need of care, and policies are yet to address their needs. “The government only knows women as a reproductive person, not post-reproductive. She’s not a woman, or she is only defined by her uterus,” says Rajput. What is required is a post-reproductive health policy and scheme, she explains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq002b3b5zg2sj6hih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The persistent stigma around menopause also needs addressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq002c3b5zl4talods@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The perception around menopause needs to change. And a large part of that comes with awareness,” says Delanarelle of the UK NHS trust. She believes that teaching teenage girls about menopause in school can make a difference because “as they grow up…they understand that menopause is not the end of the line for them. It’s another chapter. You’ve got a book, and menopause is another chapter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The gases can facilitate cellular messaging with the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2021/03/26/10/istock-1191982887.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2021/03/26/10/istock-1191982887.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2021/03/26/10/istock-1191982887.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Scientists suggest that smelling the rotten-egg stench that often comes with flatulence may help ward off Alzheimer’s disease" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-121659"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Scientists suggest that smelling the rotten-egg stench that often comes with flatulence may help ward off Alzheimer’s disease&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hydrogen sulfide modifies target proteins through a process called chemical sulfhydration, according to co-author Dr. Solomon Snyder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here, using the same method, we now confirm a decrease in sulfhydration in the AD brain,” collaborator Dr. Milos Filipovic said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, Johns Hopkins Medicine scientists looked at mice that were genetically modified to mimic human Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were injected with a hydrogen sulfide-carrying compound called NaGYY, which slowly released passenger hydrogen sulfide molecules throughout the body. The mice were tested for changes in memory and motor function over a 12-week period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior tests on the mice showed that hydrogen sulfide improved cognitive and motor function by 50 percent compared to mice that did not receive the injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice that received the treatment were better able to remember the locations of platform edits and appeared more physically active than the mice that had simulated Alzheimer’s disease but did not receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide, but the researchers wanted to investigate how the brain chemically reacted to the gaseous molecule,” Johns Hopkins Medicine &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease"&gt;wrote in a press release about the study. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-121660"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). When there are healthy levels of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β acts as a signaling molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that in the absence of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β is overattracted to another protein in the brain called Tau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When GSK3β and Tau interact, Tau causes clumps inside nerve cells. As those clumps grow, the tangled proteins block communication between the nerves, eventually causing them to die, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease,” the press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cascade of events is important to designing therapies that can block this interaction like hydrogen sulfide is able to do,” Ph.D student Daniel Giovinazzo, the first author of the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, researchers lacked the tools to mimic how the body makes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The compound used in this study does just that and shows by correcting brain levels of hydrogen sulfide, we could successfully reverse some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease,” collaborator Dr. Matt Whiteman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 04:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNZUMxdmw0bC1kMGdWcnB4N0puU3I5UTNOQ0VuRnczR1hoeWxqTU10SmZieTRaNm1oSWpqWFZDOUhrZVpDTlRxM2pMcENuQ0Jzem9OdzUyRlM4bWQtQ0c2ZnJ6YU5EZzBjS3ZnMnNDR2VrTFZLc0NCNEp2ZjBEemtCTHdaNFdsSFZtVHBEaS1Dc0djY1FlVElMTUVESmVDOUcyemhmMV9ncHI</guid></item><item><title>您的驾驶选择可能隐藏了未来认知能力下降的迹象- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/your-driving-choices-could-be-hiding-signs-of-future-cognitive-decline</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Early signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-speech-trait-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; may influence our driving habits, making our choices in travel times and routes a potential indicator of future mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Washington University in St Louis found that a tendency to drive less often and to stick to familiar paths could herald a need for early intervention for drivers who may be at risk of a future road accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with other symptoms, information on a patient's driving may help inform a diagnosis. The team showed how adding data from GPS trackers to standard age and memory tests, along with other demographic factors, enabled the researchers to accurately detect cognitive decline among individuals with preexisting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 87 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dementia-pill-clears-first-major-safety-hurdle-trial-reports"&gt;New Dementia Pill Clears First Major Safety Hurdle, Trial Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early identification of older drivers who are at risk for accidents is a public health priority, but identifying people who are unsafe is challenging and time-consuming," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5298"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurology researcher Ganesh Babulal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that using a GPS data tracking device, we could more accurately determine who had developed cognitive issues than looking at just factors such as age, cognitive test scores, and whether they had a genetic risk factor related to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183968" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184221" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642.jpg" alt="graphs showing mild cognitive impairment and driving" class="wp-image-184221 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184221" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;B) Longer trips and C) speeding per trip declined as measured over 40 months, comparing cognitively normal (red/dashed) with MCI (blue/solid) (Chen et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data on 56 individuals already diagnosed with MCI (a precursor to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;), comparing them to 242 people of a similar demographic with no cognitive issues. The average age of all participants was 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at driving patterns logged automatically by the volunteers' vehicles across a study period of up to 40 months, together with results from well-established tests, including tasks related to memory, attention, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for factors including age, education, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;genetic risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, the group with MCI showed differences in their driving over time: they drove less often, to fewer places, via simpler routes, while speeding less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the driving data on its own correctly identified individuals with MCI 82 percent of the time.

Neurologist &lt;a href="http://slakhan.gnif.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7986512" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Shaheen Lakhan&lt;/a&gt; says your favorite bubbly beverage is just flat-out bad for your brain. “Soda is one of the worst foods for brain health due to the high concentration of simple sugars, which damage the blood vessels supplying the brain,” he said. “Over time, this starves the brain from the very fuels it needs to function, leading to premature dementia and strokes. Acutely, sugar also causes brain inflammation, irritability, poor mood, and sleep disturbances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the constant highs and lows (the proverbial sugar “rush” and “crash”) can also cause a state of addiction with cravings and withdrawals — and diet soda is no better. “Even diet or zero versions of soda have negative effects, as the calorie-free additives stress out the brain and trick it into consuming more calories and craving real sugar,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margarine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Cough medicines can't treat the underlying virus but they can soothe your throat and reduce the tickly sensations that make you cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If it's a dry cough then choosing balsams or sickly-sweet syrup-based soothing agents like glycerol, can help "coat your throat" and protect against the dryness, says Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But paying more for these isn't worth it with cheaper supermarket-own brands just as effective as the big names, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The one thing to look out for on the label though is sugar content which as you'd expect with sweet syrups is often very high. Sugar-free cough medicines could be a better option if that's a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cough medicines often also advertise that they contain certain "active ingredients". These can include dextromethorphan, which claims to suppress your cough reflex - although Prof Smith says the impact is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dosing is always important she adds, but especially with dextromethorphan which can be addictive. "You certainly wouldn't want to exceed the doses advised on the label," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Levomenthol - an ingredient found in some cough syrups for chesty coughs - meanwhile, offers a "cooling sensation" at the back of the throat, which limits the tickle by masking the sense of irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Drink water and wait it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A women coughing heavily into a tissue" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If it's a chesty cough then many find themselves battling what can feel like oceans of phlegm and a tight chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This can come from secondary infections like bronchitis, which inflame the airways, or the extra build-up of phlegm in your nose and sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's natural to turn to an over-the-counter syrup, but Prof Smith's advice is to remain sceptical of their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The ingredient guaifenesin, for instance, is claimed to loosen phlegm, but this lacks conclusive proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And while sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine might help you sleep at night, they don't treat the cough itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There's similarly little evidence that plant extracts, like thyme and squill, have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead, Prof Smith says the best approach is for people to "wait it out", drink water to stay hydrated and take lozenges that encourage swallowing and "inhibit a cough" for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What about honey and lemon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A warm homemade mixture of honey and lemon can have just the same soothing effect for dry coughs as many over-the-counter options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD007094_honey-acute-cough-children" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;A Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt;  – an independent review of evidence - suggested that for children over one year with coughs and colds, the use of honey and lemon could "be of some benefit," adds Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Cough it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's also worth remembering that coughing is necessary.

"I won't try and suppress it, get it out." If you do, make sure you use a tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But should you swallow, no harm is done and the stomach can still break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;You should only worry about the colour of what you're coughing up if it's dark brown as "there may be some blood in it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most chesty coughs generally settle after a few weeks without needing antibiotics, but if it lingers beyond three weeks, Prof Smith urges people to go to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE14REFaUV9hUFFWRkx2TGRDVTZmWVpxRHNoMlVWOG4wbTJjM2RJSW5aOHpkcWFuUTBBcGJWNnRXazYzSkFJZm14ZUhfZ2tLTXpRaHNEV0IyRWlTZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9TRERhNVFwRDh5cVdhRnNfSXhEX3V2bXk1LVdzMndKcmNfY3VMODE3ODNiWGZKeFc0a01XNlI5U2FPcGM3OUw5RklKYXBwMV9IaGhseVYyalVYb016RHNv</guid></item><item><title>一名男子在救援行动中将受伤的动物穿上外套后被狂犬病浣熊咬伤- East Idaho News</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/12/man-bitten-by-rabid-raccoon-after-putting-injured-animal-in-his-coat-during-rescue-attempt/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;CHEROKEE COUNTY, Georgia (&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/georgia-man-bitten-by-rabid-raccoon-after-putting-injured-animal-in-his-coat-during-rescue-attempt/"&gt;WUPA&lt;/a&gt;) — A Cherokee County man’s attempt to rescue an injured raccoon that he found in the middle of the road ended with him in the hospital being treated for a possible rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the Chattahoochee Nature Center shared the story on Facebook over the weekend, saying it was an incident “that we feel needs to be addressed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the center, the man found the injured animal vocalizing in the road. Because he didn’t have anything to contain the wild animal, he wrapped the raccoon in his coat and “held it against his chest” as he drove for more than an hour to the nature center, which is not licensed to rehabilitate mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point during the drive, officials say the raccoon got somewhat free and bit the man on his face and hands. He then made a pit stop at home, wrapped the animal in a blanket using duct tape, and continued his journey to the center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The man arrived at the CNC an hour before the Wildlife Clinic was set to open, but just as local children were coming for the nature center’s Thanksgiving break camp. The camp director alerted the wildlife staff about what was happening, and the staff met the man in the parking lot to secure the animal in a kennel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After much forceful insistence on our part, he finally agreed to go to the hospital for treatment while we dealt with the raccoon,” the CNC staff wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The raccoon was euthanized and tested at Bells Ferry Veterinary Hospital. Officials say the tests confirmed that the animal had rabies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a further complication, the staff says the man did not give the Wildlife Department or the hospital his full name and instead provided the hospital with a fake phone number. They only learned his real name when a family member called the CNC the next day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While the finder’s heart was in the right place, he put himself, his family, CNC’s staff, volunteers, and visitors, the GWN transporter, and the staff of Bells Ferry all at risk,” the center wrote. “PLEASE take a minute and assess the situation before attempting to capture wildlife without direction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see a wild animal in distress, you can reach out to licensed rehabilitators through Animal Help Now and or the Georgia Wildlife Network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2016/05/yellowstone-tourists-worried-bison-calf-is-cold-so-they-put-it-in-their-car/"&gt;RELATED | Yellowstone tourists put bison calf in car because they’re worried it’s cold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That huge number helps explain why interest in gut-friendly bacteria, found in probiotics and fermented foods, has exploded in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now asking when probiotics, live microbes that can benefit health, truly help people and when they end up doing very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies from teams in the United States, Europe, and Asia test whether particular probiotic strains influence digestion, mood, immunity, and heart risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-probiotics-and-human-health"&gt;Probiotics and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One researcher at the center of this work is Chong Su Kim, PhD, at Seoul National University in South Korea (&lt;a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNU&lt;/a&gt;). Kim’s research focuses on how gut-friendly bacteria influence thinking skills and stress levels in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international science group &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;defines&lt;/a&gt; probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organisms are added to yogurt, kefir, and other foods or packed into capsules that survive the trip through your digestive tract. Your intestinal wall is lined with a microbiome, a community of microbes living on and in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that community is diverse and balanced, it helps &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tortillas-can-last-a-month-without-refrigeration/"&gt;digest food&lt;/a&gt;, trains the immune system, and keeps harmful microbes in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because different species behave differently, a probiotic that eases diarrhea in one trial might not help constipation or bloating in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who study clinical data stress that probiotic effects are strain specific and condition specific, so recommendations need to be much more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-health-and-probiotics"&gt;Gut health and probiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many trials look at short term problems like antibiotic related diarrhea, constipation, or flares of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these studies show that certain probiotic strains can modestly lower the chance of these issues or shorten how long they last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, a long lasting gut disorder with pain and bowel changes, the picture is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews find modest gains in pain and bloating for some products, yet one gastroenterology group considers the evidence too weak for routine use. Evidence is sometimes strongest in very specific situations rather than everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one four week &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, marathon runners taking a multi strain probiotic had fewer gut symptoms during the race than those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, other trials see no meaningful change in similar symptoms, even when they use high doses or combinations of strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday digestive complaints, probiotics are best seen as one experiment among many, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/"&gt;diet changes&lt;/a&gt;, rather than an automatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-between-gut-and-brain"&gt;Signals between gut and brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often frame this connection as the gut brain axis, the two way flow of signals between intestinal microbes and the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in gut bacteria can affect stress hormones, immune signals, and even the chemicals that nerve cells use to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one 12-week &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/76/1/32/5821144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults over 65 took a capsule containing two Bifidobacterium strains or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who received the probiotic showed higher levels of a brain growth factor that helps support learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing up the findings, the authors wrote that “probiotics promote mental flexibility and alleviate stress in older adults” in their report on this trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim and colleagues emphasized that the work involved relatively healthy people and does not replace standard care for depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-immunity-and-infections"&gt;Heart, immunity, and infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond gut and brain health, probiotics have been tested for their effects on cholesterol, blood sugar, and low grade inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; combining human trials reported that vitamin D plus probiotics slightly improved heart blood markers compared with vitamin D alone or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those changes are much smaller than the effects of cholesterol medicines, yet they hint that some people might gain a small extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart trials using probiotics alone have shown mixed results, with some lowering bad cholesterol slightly and others showing no real difference from placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics have also been tested for upper respiratory tract infections, infections of the nose, throat, and sinuses that cause most common colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9400717/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from a group of trials found that people taking probiotics were less likely to experience at least one of these infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodes also tended to be shorter, though the strength of this finding varied depending on the type of probiotic and the group studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results hint at an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-probiotic-could-make-it-safer-to-eat-seafood/"&gt;immune benefit&lt;/a&gt;, but they do not turn probiotics into substitutes for vaccines or simple habits like handwashing and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-probiotics-on-your-plate"&gt;Probiotics on your plate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before capsules existed, people took in helpful microbes through fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/video/kombucha-brewing-improved-by-scientists/"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods bring flavor and texture along with bacteria and yeasts that can support a more varied gut community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every fermented product sold in stores still contains live cultures, because pasteurizing and other processing steps can kill the microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking labels for phrases like live and active cultures and storing products in fridge raises odds that organisms survive until you eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health also depends on what surrounds those fermented foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds that feed your existing microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians encourage people to focus on a varied eating pattern rich in fiber and plant foods before turning to pills for everyday digestive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-a-supplement-wisely"&gt;Choosing a supplement wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering a probiotic supplement, especially children, pregnant people, or those with weak immunity, should first discuss it with a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are critically ill or who have central lines have, in rare cases, developed serious infections from probiotic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most supplement labels list the dose in colony forming units, a count of live microbes expected in a serving by the end of shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many products provide about 1 to 10 billion units a day, but the useful amount varies with the strain and the health goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the safest approach is to match a probiotic to a goal, such as testing whether it eases one clearly defined symptom, and to keep expectations modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking with health professionals and focusing on food sources first helps people use &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/probiotics-help-overweight-dogs-shed-pounds/"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Powerful federal advisers this week are expected to make a controversial change to how babies are immunized against hepatitis B, and to question how pediatricians inoculate children against more than a dozen other infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, whooping cough and polio.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ACIP) is convening Thursday and Friday for a closely watched meeting to rethink fundamental elements of the childhood vaccination schedule, which has protected children from dangerous diseases for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The potential changes are welcomed by allies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We're now starting to see truth telling about vaccines, and needless to say, pharma, medicine, academia, mainstream media are not happy," Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense said &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1996203075367743521" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted to the group's social media page. The nonprofit advocates against vaccines and was co-founded by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting underscores grave concerns among many public health experts, who fear it will further erode childhood vaccinations, leading to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We now seem to have entered a dangerous new phase in Secretary Kennedy's campaign to shut down scientific expertise, silence the best available evidence, and replace it with his own personal agenda," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8599" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Anschutz who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics's committee on infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee, established in 1964, had long been considered a definitive source of information about childhood vaccines. It wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the pediatrics academy and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The committee's September meeting devolved into chaos. A scheduled vote on the hepatitis B vaccine was tabled amid confusion. The chairman was&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/renowned-epidemiologist-and-biostatistician-martin-kulldorff-appointed-to-senior-hhs-role.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. The new chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, is a pediatric cardiologist and fellow with the Independent Medical Alliance – a group which continues to recommend treating COVID with drugs like ivermectin, even though studies have shown it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Confidence in the CDC was further eroded last month when the agency &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changed its stance on whether vaccines may cause autism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a theory championed by Kennedy and other anti-vaccine activists but long debunked by a large body of high-quality research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response, many independent medical groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1uu9d3q*_ga*NTIyNjU3NDI2LjE3NTk0MzYyNjM.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkbzUkZzAkdDE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/immunization-schedules/birth-through-age-18-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a newly formed effort at the University of Minnesota called the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Projec&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;t, have begun issuing independent recommendations, which some states have begun following instead.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccine schedule under the microscope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is expected to hear the first report by a new working group tasked with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine preventable diseases, which are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have seen more measles cases in our country this year than we have in recent history. In my own community, we're seeing quite significant upticks in pertussis," said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department, based in Charlotte, N.C., "Any barriers [to vaccination] that might be created by bureaucracy or process pose a threat to the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine proponents say every vaccine is carefully evaluated for safety and effectiveness before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators monitor all vaccines for safety issues after doctors start using them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Children receive the roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don't catch dangerous diseases when they're most vulnerable, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every vaccine on that schedule and the recommended timing of it exists for a reason," says pediatrician O'Leary. "It's based on the age at which a child's immune system can provide optimal protection after vaccination, balanced with the age when the child is at highest risk for a disease. There's no reason to delay or space out vaccines – doing so just puts children at risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child's immune system. But supporters say children are exposed to far more immune stimulation from naturally occurring microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine saying we can only use medicines now that were developed before 1990," O'Leary says. "Imagine where we would be in medicine today. These newer vaccines are a good thing. They save lives. That's why we give them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A change for the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first concrete step expected from the committee is a vote to change the current recommendation that all babies get vaccinated against hepatitis B within the first 24 hours of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the committee might recommend, but it could include delaying the shot or requiring a detailed discussion with parents before administering the shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Proponents of the change argue universal vaccination at birth is unnecessary because hepatitis B is often spread through sexual contact and drug use. Babies could be protected by increased screening of pregnant women and only inoculating babies of mothers who test positive, some argue. Supporters of the change also point to other countries that don't give newborns the dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But hepatitis B spreads other ways. The virus is highly infectious, and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood. People can also get infected by coming into contact with common household objects, such as toothbrushes, and towels, that have been contaminated by another family member.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A new analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by researchers who have presented at past ACIP meetings finds that delaying hepatitis B vaccination by just a few months could lead to more than $222 million in excess healthcare costs and hundreds of preventable deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most babies infected with the virus end up with chronic infections, which increases their risk for liver disease, failure and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Universal vaccination has been the cornerstone of hepatitis B elimination efforts for decades," says Eric Hall, assistant professor of epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University, and a co-author on the analysis. "It's very important we continue this work and do not undo the important public health achievements of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;past 45 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Inoculating all babies at birth has resulted in a dramatic decrease in hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The hepatitis B vaccine has one of the most well-established safety records of any vaccine, and it's one of our best," O'Leary says. "We've been using it for a long time. It's one of our best tools to protect babies from chronic illness and liver cancer. This is a situation where one missed case is too many."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that pediatricians partner with parents on children's health. "You probably will also hear a lot from individuals in this meeting who claim parents don't get a say in their children's immunizations," he said. "I want to be very clear when I say that's completely false. … We want to make sure we're protecting children from harmful diseases while also making sure the parents are fully informed and involved in the process."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, proponents of universal hepatitis B vaccination at birth argue there is no evidence the current approach is unsafe. And delaying the first dose would cause major problems because the subsequent two doses are administered as part of combination vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts are also alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Aluminum ingredients under fire&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee is also studying the safety of an ingredient commonly used in vaccines, an additive that contains aluminum. Coming after other recent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/06/nx-s1-5454890/vaccine-ingredient-thimerosal-cdc-acip" target="_blank"&gt;changes to vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;, many public health experts worry that the administration may now try to remove the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For almost a century, some important vaccines, including shots that protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis and the flu, have included aluminum salts, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/adjuvants.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;compounds that contain small amounts of aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They are used as adjuvants to give the immune system an extra boost to make the shots protective.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What aluminum does is it draws the immune system's attention to that particular little protein so that it makes a much more robust immune response that you then are protected by," O'Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One question the working group is considering is "do either of the two different aluminum adjuvants increase the risk of asthma?" according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/child-schedule-tor-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; outlining the group's mandate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most public health experts say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40658954/" target="_blank"&gt;large Danish study &lt;/a&gt;recently debunked any danger. People are exposed to &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/phs/phs.aspx?phsid=1076&amp;amp;toxid=34" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis from food, consumer products and their surrounding environment than from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to concerns over asthma, critics claim aluminum can&lt;a href="https://www.aluminiumresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt; also increase the risk for other health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Based on large, long-term studies and immunology research, there is no evidence that vaccines cause either allergies or autoimmune disorders e.g., Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus," Dr. Frank Virant, president of the Board of Directors at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;amp; Immunology, wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But removing aluminum from vaccines would render them ineffective, and there are no substitute vaccines ready to go. It could take years to develop reformulated replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But there are also positive attributes associated with psychological disorders— and acknowledging them can reduce stigma, improve care and provide hope to patients and their families.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the case made in a new paper titled Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows people standing in a spotlight." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“Some of the most creative minds in our society have also been the minds of people who had mental illness,” said Gruber. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In it, University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor June Gruber and co-authors at Cornell University point to dozens of studies dating back decades, which associate mental illness with heightened creativity, empathy, resilience and other positive qualities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prevailing narrative in clinical psychology focuses on mental health from a disease model perspective—we are taught to diagnose what’s wrong and try to fix it,” said Gruber, director of the Positive Emotion and Psychopathology Lab at CU Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leaves out the fact that at the same time people struggle with mental health challenges, they may also grow, thrive and even develop unique strengths.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in Current Directions in Psychological Science, the paper highlights evidence showing that people with mild schizophrenia, hypomania and bipolar disorder tend to score higher on measures of creativity and gravitate toward more creative professions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the most creative minds in our society have also been the minds of people who had mental illness,” said Gruber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of depression also tend to show more willingness to cooperate, research from Gruber’s lab and others has shown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CU Boulder study of nearly 2,000 college students found that although those on the bipolar spectrum report greater social conflict, they also report significantly larger social networks and feel greater social support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study from Gruber’s lab found that while young adults at increased risk for mania tend to perceive even negative situations in an overly positive light, they are also better at detecting emotional shifts in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, our findings show that along with well-documented social challenges that come with mood disorders, there may also be meaningful social strengths,” said Gruber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the silver linings paper, the authors note that many people in remission from mental illness look back on their darkest struggles as catalysts that helped them build resilience and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take one 2019 study, led by Cornell Psychology Professor Jonathan Rottenberg, a co-author on the ‘silver linings’ paper. It found that 10 years after being diagnosed with clinical depression, 10% of study participants were “thriving” (meaning they were not only free of depression but had a psychological well-being better than one-quarter of nondepressed adults). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruber and Rottenberg said they do not intend to convey a “Pollyanna,” or “all-will-be-well” approach that glosses over the real suffering that comes with mental illness. But they do want to provide hope, rooted in data, that positive outcomes can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stress that the paper is not a call to abandon medication or psychotherapy, which can be lifesaving. Rather, it is a call for a more holistic approach to research and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging silver linings, Gruber believes her field can reduce stigma and potentially develop treatment plans that seek to preserve the unique traits people like about themselves while keeping the harmful elements of their illness at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a more holistic understanding of a person, you can do more to support them,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790674258"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can mental illness be linked to positive traits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Research shows some psychological conditions are associated with strengths like creativity, empathy, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790675864"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does this mean mental illness is not serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: No. The findings do not minimize suffering but highlight that positive traits can coexist with serious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790675601"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Are people able to fully recover and thrive after mental illness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Long-term data show a portion of individuals achieve both remission and above-average psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14787d67753a797566677c75787854777b787b6675707b3a717061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Marshall – University of Colorado&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09637214251360738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change&lt;/a&gt;” by June Gruber et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional research on people with psychological disorders is negatively focused, concentrating on what is aberrant and harmful about psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet we argue that the conventional approach to psychopathology is factually incomplete and may also inadvertently perpetuate the deeply entrenched stigma surrounding mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology—silver linings—and integrating them into psychopathology research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our research agenda for studying silver linings in psychopathology (SLIP), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation.

The country of Wales unintentionally produced one of those moments when a routine shingles vaccine – given only to people hitting a very narrow age window – appeared to protect long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unexpected pattern caught the attention of &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; researchers, who combed through years of medical records and found something striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study deepened the story, pointing toward viral reactivation, immune aging, and neuroinflammation as powerful – and often overlooked – forces in cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that a simple shingles shot may do far more for the aging brain than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-dormant-viruses-awaken"&gt;When dormant viruses awaken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varicella-zoster remains silent in nerve cells after childhood infection. Reactivation risk rises with age. Dementia research once focused on plaques and tangles alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work highlights neuroinflammation as a major driver. Neurotropic herpesviruses can seed amyloid in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human organoid work links viral activity with tau changes. Chronic viral stress may push immune pathways into harmful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/where-you-live-may-affect-your-dementia-risk/"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Reactivation pulses may degrade cognitive reserve over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wales introduced a live shingles vaccine with strict age rules. Only individuals aged exactly 79 in early autumn gained access for one year. Individuals just older lost access permanently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This narrow gap created two nearly identical groups. Corresponding author Pascal Geldsetzer explained a key concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these associational studies suffer from the basic problem that people who go get vaccinated have different health &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-is-a-growing-global-health-crisis-with-a-staggering-cost/"&gt;behaviors&lt;/a&gt; than those who don’t,” he said. The Welsh plan solved that concern through pure timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-and-the-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Dementia and the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford Medicine tracked outcomes across seven years. Vaccinated individuals showed a 20 percent lower rate of dementia. A &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper expanded that pattern. Mild cognitive impairment fell in the vaccinated group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia-related deaths also dropped across nearly a decade. Evidence pointed to protection across the full disease path. Regression methods reduced confounding risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other intervention aligned with the exact birthdate rule. Consistent outcomes supported a causal interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment signals early trouble in memory networks. The &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; study followed over 200,000 new cases. Vaccine eligibility lowered new diagnoses over a nine-year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual vaccine receipt lowered risk even more. Analyses held firm across many statistical checks. The age difference was only a few days, yet protection remained clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral mechanisms likely shaped this early stage through reduced reactivation events. Reduced immune stress may preserve neural circuits in vulnerable regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccine-slowed-dementia"&gt;Vaccine slowed dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second group included individuals already living with dementia. Nearly half died from dementia causes over nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals showed far fewer dementia-related deaths. Actual vaccine receipt dropped that risk by nearly one-third. Evidence again pointed to broad &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most exciting part is that the shingles vaccine doesn’t have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,” Geldsetzer said. Survival gains hinted at reduced inflammatory pressure in advanced disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women gained stronger protection in both early and late stages. Women often mount higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-after-vaccination-improves-antibody-levels/"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; responses after live vaccines. Varicella-zoster reactivation also appears more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors may amplify vaccine impact on immune tone. Cognitive decline risk falls as immune stability rises. Women showed reductions in mild cognitive impairment and dementia-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men did not show clear shifts in either stage. Sex-linked immune biology may hold crucial clues for future work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-dementia-with-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Preventing dementia with shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work explores immune pathways independent of viral action. Some vaccines boost innate pathways in older age. Such boosts may counter immunosenescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live vaccines often produce broad health gains unrelated to direct targets. Some work links vaccination with stronger long term immune balance. Reduced chronic inflammation may protect neural circuits across many decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New theory suggests cumulative viral reactivations erode &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; resilience. Shingles vaccination may interrupt harmful cycles early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar age-based rollouts in Australia and several other countries now show matching results. Records from England, New Zealand, and Canada echo the Welsh pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains appear stable across cultures, health systems, and demographics. “We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,” Geldsetzer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such uniformity strengthens confidence in causal action. International teams now explore additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-lessons-from-shingles"&gt;Dementia lessons from shingles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized trial could confirm these findings with full certainty. Geldsetzer called it simple. “It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,” he said. Wales showed curve separation within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial may reveal early signals without long waits. Newer shingles vaccines may offer even stronger impact. Philanthropic support now aims to launch such work soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work suggests a single shot may slow decline across many stages of dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/public-health-and-environmental-justice-the-push-for-electric-trucks-in-cities/"&gt;Public health&lt;/a&gt; systems rarely create natural experiments of such clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation of Wales offered one such moment. Research now points toward practical potential for brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 19:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVGxtZzVyOHRVaExtUzBzY2pXNEc2X3FRdlJ5dlpuVGR2MzZPVkNGU1BJMUY1UnBhb3BLVk4zYnlkbkVQOVJlQVJBMHo4OWpVVG50em91cFBwbTF5elJZRy1NOGhYZE1Yd0JHU2ZhQnQyNXFGRTBqdl82dThveG8wOUJocE5DcXphdjBJQ1JLVFdvbWdzYjAw</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬看到他的晚餐部分并立即选择暴力-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-sees-dinner-portion-184000000.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are few ad campaigns more iconic than Snickers' "You're not yourself when you're hungry." And honestly, it worked because they were onto something. I can be many things in this life, but hungry is not the version of me anyone wants to meet. I've canceled first meetings out of fear of being hangry and unhinged. My therapist would call that self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And as it turns out, dogs aren't above that struggle either. Especially not golden retrievers, who may be angelic 90 percent of the time but turn into full-on dramatic divas the moment dinner is late—or, in this case, when dinner feels like a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐶&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pups get loud, some get pouty, but the golden retriever in this viral TikTok clip takes one look at his dinner portion and decides to enter his villain era. The moment his dad pours just a sprinkle of kibble into the bowl, everything inside this dog snaps like a glowstick at a middle-school dance. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most relatable funny dog videos of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before we dive in, this isn't the first time a pet has delivered a meltdown worthy of an Oscar. Just recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/tiktok-t-stop-laughing-goldendoodle-144000340.html" data-ylk="slk:goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum&lt;/a&gt; had TikTok in tears from laughing, and this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/very-tiny-very-angry-bunny-172000057.html" data-ylk="slk:tiny angry bunny losing his mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;tiny angry bunny losing his mind&lt;/a&gt; proved that even small pets can unleash big drama. Whether it is hunger rage, toy rage, or bunny rage, we are witnessing the full spectrum of unhinged animal behavior, and I must admit I am a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever's Dinner Bowl Meltdown Is Sending TikTok Into Chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The golden retriever in the video starts hopeful, tail wagging, eyes bright, fully believing in the goodness of the world. Then Dad empties a few lonely pieces of kibble into his bowl and sweetly says, "Here you go, big guy." And that's when tragedy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The dog freezes. The ominous music swells. One eyebrow goes up like he's questioning the entire foundation of their relationship. Then comes "the look." The universal dog expression that says, "BFFR."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/popcorn-explosion-tiktok-says-dog-014000429.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the very next moment, chaos erupts. The video jumps from mild concern to "choose your fighter" energy as the golden retriever launches himself at his dad in full WWE mode. It's the kind of hangry dog behavior every pet parent recognizes: one second they're sweet, the next they're a chaotic gremlin fueled solely by betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;TikTok felt that energy instantly. One viewer joked, "So you have chosen… DEATH," while another added, "Oh, we still playing games?"

Because, honestly, I don’t think “Hey, let’s not subject Caiden (or the overworked mall Santa) to another traumatic incident this year!” should be that difficult of a request. Let me ask you—are your in-laws psychotic Santa freaks, too? Are they going to cut off Caiden’s trust fund if he can’t keep his shit together while sitting on that strange man’s lap?&lt;/p&gt;

If Bridget laughs you off dismissively, there is only one thing left to do: Fill her entire underwear drawer with coal.&lt;/p&gt;

But as a result, my ex-wife has full custody, and I get the kids for four hours every weekend at my home. My question is about the anxiety I feel around the time with the kids, which is centered on the idea that I have to maximize every second to be a good dad given these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

But other times I have a football game on and they play by themselves. None of them care about watching sports, but sometimes they hang around and watch a little, though usually they get into their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

But she gets days and nights with them and car trips and mall trips and family vacations, etc.  Because I only get these four hours I feel like I am supposed to be an all-out Dad for every minute of it, for them and for me.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand the anxiety and insecurity, but there is no way to ever be in “all-out” dad mode for four hours with three kids, so relieve yourself of that pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

Don’t catastrophize this!  I’m sure that thousands of “World’s Best Dad” coffee mugs have been gifted to fathers much lousier than you.&lt;/p&gt;

But–this is crucial–try not to obsess over having the perfect moment or being the perfect dad for that moment, and go easy on yourself and them. They’re glad you’re still in their lives, and I’m sure your ex-wife is, too. So when they’re in your care, read the room: The best way to show love and provide safety could be to let everyone feel like they can decompress however they need to, and that includes you.&lt;/p&gt;

My youngest daughter, E (29), is very much estranged from me but requires me to see her a few times during the year. This causes me much distress, but I want to remain present when she wants me to be there. The issue I am having is that she always throws me an offhand comment that has double meanings during these times. Her words hurt me very much. Up until yesterday, I have mostly not acknowledged them. But she stated, “I basically raised myself from 13 on.” I have recently realized that I had made some bad and uncharacteristic decisions from her thirteenth year up to about six months ago. I have had some great revelations in therapy and feel very grounded and future-focused. She’s in therapy too, and I know I am the reason for that. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/11/therapy-revelations-forgiveness-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;But she does not want to forgive me.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Retrospective cases were selected based on the availability of archived primary tumour and matched normal blood samples, along with sufficient clinical information, and were enroled regardless of disease stage or survival status at accrual. All retrospective samples were obtained shortly after diagnosis, typically at curative-intent surgery. Detailed study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the CONSORT diagram are provided in &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09812-3#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Methods&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09812-3#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both institutions (Samsung Medical Center: SMC 2022-05-050 and SMC 2013-04-005; Seoul St Mary’s Hospital: KC21TISI0007 and KC22TISI0292) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent, including consent to publish de-identified clinical and genomic data, was obtained from all prospective participants. For retrospective cases, the use and publication of de-identified data were approved by the relevant institutional review boards, with a waiver of informed consent where applicable. A subset of participants was enroled as part of substudy components within the clinical trials &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03131089"&gt;NCT03131089&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06334471"&gt;NCT06334471&lt;/a&gt;, which informed specific aspects of the study design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Sample preparation for sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed WGS using CancerVision assay as previously reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Lee, S. et al.

In brief, WGS was performed on tumour samples obtained as part of routine clinical care either via surgery or biopsy and stored as fresh frozen tissue. For biopsy sample cores were retrieved first for routine pathology, followed by at least one additional core for cancer WGS. Biopsy sample cores were retrieved first for routine pathology, followed by at least one additional core for cancer WGS. For the matched normal samples peripheral blood was used. DNA extraction and library preparation was performed at the Inocras in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. We used the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) for DNA extraction, and TruSeq DNA PCR-Free (Illumina) for library preparation. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina) with an average depth of coverage of 40x for tumour and 20x for blood. Quality assessment of the WGS data is available in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09812-3#MOESM3"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For whole-transcriptome sequencing, total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the purity and integrity were assessed by the TapeStation RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA-sequencing analysis enabled detection of both coding and noncoding RNA, along with other long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). RNA-sequencing libraries were constructed using the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit, with RiboErase (Roche Molecular Systems, following the manufacturer’s protocol. We quantified and assessed the libraries using KAPA Library Quantification Kits for Illumina Sequencing platforms according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide (KAPA Biosystems, KK4854) and the TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (5067–5582, Agilent Technologies) recommendations. The generated libraries were sequenced by using a paired-end 150-bp read protocol on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) with the S4 reagent kit (Illumina).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Genomic analysis and interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive genomic analysis and interpretation were conducted using the CancerVision platform (Inocras).

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine — the first shot found to prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s committee on Thursday is expected to change that — contradicting previous public health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization’s Dr. Sean O’Leary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Liver disease can cause lifelong health issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some — especially infants and children — it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don’t completely clear the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Shots for newborns have been recommended for years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the nation’s vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren’t tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee revisits the newborn recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;several anti-vaccine voices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel has raised concerns about giving a vaccine to a baby so early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we asking our babies to solve an adult problem?” committee member Dr. Evelyn Griffin asked at a September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: “The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It’s one of trust. ... It’s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it’s slated to be acted on during Thursday’s meeting, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would happen if the shots are delayed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report — which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal — estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O’Leary said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee’s most direct power comes over what’s covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it scares, it shares” on social media, O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several medical and public health organizations — and even some state government officials — have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, this week called on Congress to compel Kennedy to appear at a hearing and explain ACIP’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ending the decades-long recommendation that babies born in the U.S. get vaccinated against hepatitis B is a heartless choice to allow babies to die,” Murray said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an1g000o3b78fxwxlqag@published"&gt;Parents are constantly reminded about food allergies. Whether it’s the sign on the day care window saying that the building is a nut-free space, or someone regaling you at a birthday party about all of the foods their child can’t eat, you can’t go for more than a day or two without thinking about allergic reactions. It’s just one more worry to add to the giant pile of things that you have at the back of your mind every day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an3e000p3b78cmg797a2@published"&gt;But according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, there’s good news in the realm of nuts. Peanut allergies have fallen precipitously, with rates dropping by 30 percent or more since 2013. It’s great news for anxious parents, for community spaces where children eat, and for all the kids who deserve to know the simple bliss of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Let’s look at the data the study is drawing from and at what has happened over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an5c000q3b780r0kzw2k@published"&gt;Peanut allergies were for a long time something of a source of academic disagreement. In the ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s we saw a &lt;a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/62/1/91.short?casa_token=vmHy4vQLsPIAAAAA:w-wOJjY5PEGBPhNOEWy1umYtUICdtCwx8zgpppoGcQDPyHQr7SlVrQ1D6g0TmZ0M6CWOpQVkmsKL"&gt;sharp increase&lt;/a&gt; in the number of children with allergies to a variety of foods. We still aren’t entirely clear on whether this was due to better measurement of disease, better testing, or some environmental trigger that could’ve impacted children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an98000r3b7840cpggyy@published"&gt;The advice at the time was that the &lt;a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120209132957/http:/cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotpeanutall.pdf"&gt;best strategy was avoidance&lt;/a&gt; for those at high risk of developing an allergy, determined by a combination of family history, other allergies, and having eczema, which can indicate allergy issues. If you’re never exposed to an allergen, you can’t develop an allergy, and this would result in fewer allergies in the community, the theory went. However, this advice &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/02770903.2015.1126848?casa_token=7iNQkW1BzjcAAAAA%3AS2U2SF0j6feAhrIGJ-5slwZILZQ8-xwoYANFNO9s04yR2YMBQAxsSGjympvQr46VuArJGoc7kXfO_w"&gt;did not seem&lt;/a&gt; to stem the rising tide of allergies, and in 2008 the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/121/1/183/71045?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Pediatrics_TrendMD_0&amp;amp;casa_token=O8hiPhHAYMMAAAAA:P8oMCNdWIouyzULKot_8s15KBq-S6gbPDrHdR8C7BX3kgM2vl2j2rkVJEvMIAQKcKPKXOdZUNg"&gt;officially changed&lt;/a&gt; the recommendations to say that there was no benefit to avoiding foods.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anbb000s3b78ykxeip23@published"&gt;This is where the story gets really interesting. A group of researchers noticed that peanut allergies were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674908016989?casa_token=P73_tXyYcW4AAAAA:JB96jXXix7W32QCckINiKlvlZq4h0c-VwWWnTTOzJ2s0WWywfdIqSi6tXt-91-jaG1IYJyLvVg"&gt;10 times more common&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. than in Israel. While there are many differences between the two countries, they hypothesized that this could be because Israeli children are exposed to peanuts early and often through a range of peanut-based snacks. U.K. children, on the other hand, have a much lower exposure to peanuts in their early years.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7andk000t3b78jn8osa3z@published"&gt;This led to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850"&gt;truly fascinating randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; published in 2015. Researchers took a large group of infants aged 4–11 months who were at a very high risk of getting a peanut allergy—either they already had severe eczema, an egg allergy, or both. These kids were then randomly allocated to either get peanuts regularly until they were 5 years old, or have no exposure to peanuts at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ang0000u3b78fh5nno6h@published"&gt;The results were, in a word, startling: 1 in 7 of the children in the no-peanuts group developed an allergy by age 5, compared to just 1 in 50 in the peanut group. Early peanut exposure reduced a child’s risk of developing an allergy to peanuts by a little over seven times.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ani0000v3b78cgmpb96n@published"&gt;The study immediately changed recommendations. Rather than the previous advice—which at that point was that we didn’t really know whether exposure made a difference or not—pediatricians started to advise that kids should be exposed to potential food allergens early and often. At the very least, every baby should get peanuts before they turned 1. It’s the advice I was given when my daughter was born in 2023, and it’s probably very familiar to new parents everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ankb000w3b781icktlne@published"&gt;The new research that’s just hit the headlines shows that this advice appears to be working. &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;The Pediatrics journal study&lt;/a&gt; is an observational paper looking at trends in peanut allergies in a cohort of children in the United States. The authors took kids aged 0–3 from 2013–2015, before the new advice came out, and compared them to a cohort from 2015–2019. They used a variety of statistical models to examine what happened with respect to peanut allergies and eczema over the course of two years for the children in each of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anmw000x3b78t4jjcz4c@published"&gt;Overall, there was a reduction of around 30 percent in peanut allergies. In absolute terms, around 1 in 100 kids had a diagnosed peanut allergy before the guidelines changed, and around 1 in 300 had an allergy in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anoy000y3b78zvnpw6s2@published"&gt;There are always caveats to this sort of research. While the authors did use a type of statistical modeling called an interrupted time series, which in theory allows us to make causal claims here, in practice it’s a bit more complicated. We can’t be entirely sure that this decline is driven by the guideline change. On the other hand, it’s hard to see what else could be happening here. We know that introducing peanuts early reduces peanut allergies, so the fact that they fell after the new guidelines is exactly what we’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anqv000z3b78k9ycn4vc@published"&gt;This whole story is a great example of science working exactly as intended. It’s messy, and a bit painful, but through rigorous experimentation we came to the right conclusion. We had a theory that didn’t pan out. We then came up with another theory, which proved to be true. We changed the guidelines to reflect this, and are now preventing tens of thousands of kids from developing allergies every year. In a time when science is under relentless attack, it’s a heartening reminder that the whole process can work well. We just have to let &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and lung were dissected and placed in formalin solution overnight at room temperature then exchanged to 70% ethanol for histological assessment of metastasis. Other organs were also collected and processed if relevant pathology was observed during dissection. Intestines were dissected, longitudinally opened, whole-mounted and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C in an orbital shaker.

Mice were dissected 21 days after tamoxifen and representative 2 cm segments of the proximal SI were collected. Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4% PFA, washed in PBS, optically cleared, mounted and imaged using a confocal microscope. The width of YFP-positive clones was quantified by calculating the fraction of the crypt circumference (1/8 to 8/8) occupied by YFP. The average clone width per treatment was calculated by multiplying the count of each clone size by the number of crypt fractions occupied (1–8), then dividing by the total number of clones counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Tumour gDNA extraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole PFA-fixed tumours were washed in PBS, excised, cut into smaller pieces and gDNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen 56404). In brief, tissue was digested in lysis buffer + proteinase K solution overnight at 56 °C with shaking at 1,200 rpm in a thermocycler (Eppendorf) and then homogenized in QIAshredder columns (Qiagen 79656) before in-column washing and elution in ATE buffer according to the manufacturer’s protocol (although the 90 °C incubation step after tissue digestion was omitted to avoid excessive DNA fragmentation). The concentration of the extracted DNA was assessed using a Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32854).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Primary antibodies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTNB1 (0.25 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, mouse, 610154, BD Biosciences), O6-ethyl-2′deoxyguanosine (0.5 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, rat, SQX-SQM001, Squarix Biotechnology), GFP (10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, chicken, ab13970, Abcam), PTEN (1:300, rabbit, 9559, Cell Signalling), BrdU (2.6 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, sheep, ab1893, Abcam), CD326 (EPCAM) AlexaFluor 647 antibody (1:2,000, 118210, BioLegend). Secondary antibodies were as follows: rabbit anti-rat (1:250, A110-322A, Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit anti-mouse (1:1,500, ab125913, Abcam), anti-chicken (1:500, 303-005-003, Jackson Labs) and anti-sheep (1:500, 313-005-003, Jackson Labs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Immunohistochemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed tissue was paraffin embedded and cut into 3–4 µm sections by the CRUK CI Histopathology Core. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining was performed using an automated ST5020 Multi-stainer (Leica Biosystems). Staining was performed on Leica’s automated Bond-III platform in conjunction with the Polymer Refine Detection System (Leica, DS9800). For CTNB1 and O6-ethyl-2′deoxyguanosine, antigen retrieval was performed in sodium citrate (Leica’s Epitope Retrieval Solution 1, AR9961) for 20 min at 100 °C. For GFP and BrdU, antigen retrieval was performed using enzymatic digestion. In brief, enzyme digestion (proteinase K) was run at 37 °C using Leica’s Bond enzyme concentrate (AR9551), which contains proteolytic enzyme (17 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stabilizer. For BrdU, slides were submerged in 2 M HCl for 15 min, following the dewax and rehydration step. Blocking was performed with Protein Block Buffer (X090930-2, Dako). After incubation with the primary antibody, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody before development and mounting. For CTNB1 staining, an additional mouse-on-mouse blocking step was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;RNA in situ hybridization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detection of mouse &lt;i&gt;Trp53&lt;/i&gt; was performed on FFPE sections using RNAscope 2.5 LS Reagent Kit-RED (322150, ACD) and RNAscope LS 2.5 Probe-Mm-&lt;i&gt;Trp53&lt;/i&gt;-O1 (513008, ACD). In brief, 3-µm-thick sections were baked for 1 h at 60 °C before loading onto a Bond Rx instrument (Leica Biosystems). Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated on-board before pretreatment using Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (AR9640, Leica Biosystems) at 95 °C for 15 min and ACD enzyme from the LS Reagent kit at 40 °C for 15 min. Probe hybridization and signal amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception of Amp5 (incubation for 30 min). Fast red detection was performed on the Bond Rx using the Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection Kit (DS9390, Leica Biosystems) with an incubation time of 20 min. The slides were then removed from the Bond Rx, heated at 60 °C for 1 h, dipped in Xylene and mounted using EcoMount Mounting Medium (EM897L, Biocare Medical). The slides were imaged on the Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems) system to create whole-slide images. Images were captured at ×40 magnification with a resolution of 0.25 μm per pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Single-cell preparation for flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 10 cm of proximal SI from tamoxifen-induced mice was flushed in cold PBS, longitudinally opened and cut into 0.5 cm segments. The segments were repeatedly passed through a 10 ml pipette using cold PBS until the solution ran clear, incubated in cold 5 mM EDTA/PBS for 30 min, washed and resuspended in cold PBS. Crypt-enriched fractions were released by five 5 s manual shaking cycles then pelleted and dissociated in 20 ml trypsin (1× 0.05% EDTA, 25300054, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C for 7 min with vigorous shaking every minute. After multiple washes in PBS/2% FBS, dissociated cells were resuspended in PBS/2% FBS before incubation with anti-mouse CD326 (EPCAM) AlexaFluor 647 antibody and addition of DAPI (10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) to distinguish between live and dead cells. Flow sorting was carried out on the BD FACS Aria SORP (BD Biosciences) system using appropriate single-stained and unstained controls (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09762-w#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Genotyping PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorted EPCAM-positive and EPCAM-negative cells were pelleted and washed once in cold PBS. Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the ReliaPrep gDNA tissue miniprep system (A2051, Promega) and PCR was performed according to the Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase protocol (M0493L, New England BioLabs) with enhancer, using the following primers (10 µM, 1:1:1 stoichiometry): &lt;i&gt;Kras&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;G12D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 5′-GTCTTTCCCCAGCACAGTGC, 5′-CTCTTGCCTACGCCACCAGCTC, 5′-AGCTAGCCACCATGGCTTGAGTAAGTCTGCA; &lt;i&gt;Fbxw7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;null&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 5′-CAGTGGAG TGAAGTACAACTC, 5′-GCATATTCTAGAGGAGGGTAT, 5′-GGCCAGCC TGGTCTGTATA. The resulting PCR products were analysed using the TapeStation 4200 System (Agilent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Hybridization capture bait design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A custom mouse cancer gene list was assembled, with a total of 589 genes.

To select SNVs with high-quality mismatched bases, SNVs were required to have at least two reads with the alternative allele, where at least half of the alternative alleles had a minimum base alignment quality score of 30 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 82" title="Li, H.

To remove artefactual variants found in regions where reads are frequently misaligned, SNVs were removed if at least four normal samples had at least four gapped reads within 10 bp of the variant position. To further remove likely artefacts with low VAFs, SNVs were removed if they were called in somatic mode in at least two normal samples. Moreover, a variant was removed if it fell inside a genomic region with a mappability score &amp;lt;1, where mappability was calculated from 75-mers across the reference genome using gem-mappability (build 1.315)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 83" title="Derrien, T. et al.

After removing SNPs and artefacts as above, we identified SNVs with low VAFs that were recurrent in the tumours of one or more mice. We suspect that these SNVs were due to coincident lymphoid expansions (leukaemia/lymphoma); recurrent variants were therefore excluded from the tumour call set if they had a maximum VAF ≤ 0.05, or if the variant in a matched normal sample(s) had a VAF ≥ 0.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Identification of driver genes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dNdScv package (v.0.1.0)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Martincorena, I. et al.

A subset of these SNVs (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,573) are from ENU-treated cohorts not analysed in the manuscript but were included to increase the total sample size for this analysis. &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt; high-impact SNVs and all SNVs in &lt;i&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ros1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ntrk3&lt;/i&gt; were excluded.

Expected frequencies for each of the 15 &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt; bin combinations were calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the two component bins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Decay curves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate decay curves illustrating the proportion of tumours remaining in the rescue protocol, we used &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/i&gt; mutation ratios obtained from sequencing experiments (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09762-w#Fig1"&gt;1h&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09762-w#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09762-w#Fig13"&gt;8e&lt;/a&gt;). These ratios were then multiplied by the average tumour count in the SI at each timepoint, considering both priming TE and the rescue ET10 and ET30 protocols (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09762-w#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). Subsequently, these values were divided by the TE protocol (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; = 0) to generate the plots. The same logic was applied for individual &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt; bins and &lt;i&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/i&gt; exon-3 mutation decay curves where the ratios obtained from sequencing experiments were multiplied by the average tumour count for &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/i&gt; at each timepoint. &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistical tests were used to compare observed and expected tumour counts at each rescue timepoint, with values of &amp;lt;0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Expected tumour counts were generated from neutral decay curve proportions at day 10 and day 30, multiplied by the observed tumour count in the TE priming protocol (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; = 0).

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasure is a dirty word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean this in two ways. First are the connotations or associations of the word. If a colleague asked you, “How much pleasure have you had this morning?” you might fire off an email to HR. If you saw the title “Learning to find pleasure,” or “Enjoy more pleasure,” you’d probably expect it to be in the roped-off section of the bookshop. Pleasure is frequently associated with the erotic. But second, pleasure is a dirty word because, across a variety of religious traditions and over several millennia of philosophical thought, “pleasure” has often been seen as base: vulgar, crude, and animalistic. Those who seek pleasure are no better than pigs rutting and scoffing in the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.uni.lodz.pl/pracownicy/katarzyna-de-lazari-radek"&gt;Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek&lt;/a&gt;, who has literally written the book on pleasure: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Pleasure-Introduction-Katarzyna-Lazari-Radek/dp/1138093114"&gt;The Philosophy of Pleasure: An Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. De Lazari-Radek is a hedonist, which means she thinks that the only good in life is pleasure and the only bad in life is pain. We want pleasure; we don’t want pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, it is ridiculous to call pleasure bad or dirty because pleasure is an experience — an immediate, unmistakable signal that something is good. And here we learn how to find more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-basic-reality-of-pleasure"&gt;The basic reality of pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasure doesn’t have to be some “higher” mystical state of joy or euphoria. It certainly doesn’t have to be some kind of “guilty indulgence.” Pleasure is a basic, biological feature of being a living animal — as basic as warmth or tiredness. De Lazari-Radek insists it’s not a &lt;em&gt;sensation &lt;/em&gt;— not the same thing as the taste of chocolate or the pressure of a hug — but a &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;, an evaluative gloss you lay over whatever else is happening. She calls it a “sugar coating” we apply to experience: It’s the sense of “Yes, this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you frame pleasure in this way — as an important heuristic or gauge — then it seems ridiculous to say seeking pleasure is bad. In fact, to say “seeking pleasure is bad” is functionally equivalent to saying “it’s bad to do what you want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, one of the reasons that people have moralized pleasure is that they confuse the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of pleasure with the &lt;em&gt;source &lt;/em&gt;of pleasure. “This is why,” she said, “we then talk about good and bad pleasures. Because, yes, of course, if you take pleasure in hurting others, then it may be bad, but that’s because hurting others is bad and not because pleasure itself is bad. I mean, pleasure is just this feeling, yes? So, we need to be clear and careful about saying that certain actions or certain sources may be bad. But there is nothing bad in the experience of pleasure itself. It can’t be, because it’s exactly how it feels, and almost by definition, it is always good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, we need to disentangle pleasure — the feeling and evaluative gloss — from the source of that feeling. Taking pleasure in something might be bad if it involves something bad, but the pleasure itself is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ways-to-enjoy-pleasure"&gt;Ways to enjoy pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between the source and experience of pleasure raises not only interesting moral questions but also hedonic ones as well. De Lazari-Radek argues that when we start to focus on the source of pleasures, we can learn to enjoy the sheer variety of pleasures that are out there to be enjoyed. Here are three examples from our conversation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-regarding and other-regarding pleasure:&lt;/strong&gt; Some pleasures might be an act of intentional self-care—a bath, a massage, a walk in the woods. When you come back from work, tired and stressed from that meeting that went on too long, you might crack open a new tub of ice cream. But other pleasures might involve helping other people. As de Lazari-Radek pointed out, “There is enough psychological research to show that for us to be happier, we do need to feel that we are responsible for certain things.” Sometimes, we should consciously commit to things that are other-regarding and that involve charity and responsibility, such as cooking for your children, helping someone at work, or smiling at a stranger in the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Present and delayed pleasure:&lt;/strong&gt; How does going for a run fit into the hedonist’s life? How does raising kids, working late at work, or studying really hard? If life is about responsible pleasure, why not just live like a pleasure-seeking moth, fluttering from thrill to thrill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we pursue these things not because they feel good now, but because they create pleasure later. This is a deeply adult kind of hedonism. It’s an understanding that slow mastery, accumulated effort, and long arcs of growth are among the richest pleasure sources available. Give a little to get a lot. Sow the seeds, and reap the rewards. Work hard to play hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected and unexpected pleasure: &lt;/strong&gt;You get out a glass, pop open the bottle, and pour the wine. As you lift the glass to your lips, you think, “Oooh, yes, this is going to be good.” And it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pleasures are planned and expected in this way. We are rational, deliberative creatures, and we set aside a huge amount of time to plan our pleasure. But de Lazari-Radek also pointed out that pleasure often appears without desire. You pass a bakery and smell fresh bread. Your child laughs in the next room. You overhear a stranger say something unintentionally poetic. “Pleasure just comes in,” she said, and that’s a beautiful and important point. Sometimes happiness just arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can all build our lives to increase the chances of being pleasantly ambushed. More wandering. More curiosity. More stepping away from the algorithmic walls that funnel your attention.&lt;br&gt;In other words, set yourself up to welcome more pleasure in. There is nothing wrong with pleasure, but a whole lot right. And, if de Lazari-Radek’s hedonism is right, a happy and healthy life might just be one that finds as much ethically sourced pleasure as we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The pancreas was then returned to the abdominal cavity. The abdominal layer was closed with absorbable 5/0 sutures, while the skin was closed with non-absorbable 5/0 sutures. Superglue was applied over the sutures to ensure that they did not come undone after surgery. Mice were resuscitated with saline and were subcutaneously administered Buprenorphine (10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Enrofloxacin (Baytril, 1.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for the 2 days following surgery. Mice were euthanized at week 5 following surgery and tissues were collected for transcriptomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Orthotopic breast tumour model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were implanted orthotopically with 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; E0771 breast cancer cells in 50 μl Matrigel into the thoracic mammary gland of C57BL6/J mice. Additionally, the same procedure was followed using the BALB/c-derived 4T1 breast tumour cell cancer in BALB/c mice. Mice were euthanized at week 4 after implantation and tumours were collected for transcriptomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Orthotopic lung cancer model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We administered 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; LLC cells in 100 µl PBS intravenously into the lateral tail vein of 8-week-old C57BL6/J mice. Mice were euthanized at week 1, 2 or 3 after the implantation and bloods and lungs were used for transcriptomics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Subcutaneous lung cancer model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse LLC1 implants were generated in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous implantation of 0.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells (1 injection site per mouse). Tumour growth was followed every 2 days by measuring the 2 orthogonal external diameters using a calliper. Tumour volume was calculated as &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; = π/6 × &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; represent length, width, and height, respectively. Tumours were excised and processed for flow cytometry analysis when they reached 0.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Caecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caecal ligation and puncture were performed as described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Adrover, J.

In brief, the peritoneal cavity of ketamine/xylazine-anaesthetized mice was exposed with a small incision and the caecum was exteriorized. 80% of the caecum distal to the ileo-caecal valve was ligated using non-absorbable 7-0 suture. A 23G needle was then used to puncture both walls of the distal end of the caecum, and a small drop of faeces was extruded through the perforation. The ligated and punctured caecum was relocated inside the peritoneal cavity and both peritoneum and skin were closed. Blood was extracted three days after the puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Peritonitis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male 8-to-12-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with zymosan (1 mg, intraperitoneal injection, Sigma).

After blood collection, mice were perfused via the right ventricle with 10 ml of PBS to remove circulating blood cells. Tissues, including lung, tumours, muscle, heart, placenta and pancreas, were collected, cut into small pieces, and digested with Liberase TM (Sigma) and DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following digestion, tissues were passed through 70-µm nylon mesh sieves using syringe plungers to obtain single-cell suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing femurs with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 2% FBS using a 23G needle. Spleens were mechanically dissociated through 70-µm mesh filters. For colon isolation, intestines were cleaned, cut longitudinally and washed in PBS. After a 30-min incubation in 100 mM EDTA at 37 °C with shaking to remove epithelial cells, colon tissue was cut and digested in Liberase TM and DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. Ear (skin) samples were processed by separating the dorsal and ventral sides, cutting them into small pieces, and digesting them in Liberase TM and DNase I for 90 min at 37 °C. The resulting suspensions were filtered as above. Peritoneal lavage was performed by injecting 10 ml of cold PBS into the peritoneal cavity, followed by gentle massage of the abdomen and careful aspiration of the fluid using a syringe and needle. The collected fluid was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer for staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For meninges isolation, mice were euthanized and decapitated. The skull was opened along the sagittal midline, and the brain was removed to expose the dura. The meninges were peeled off using fine forceps and placed directly into digestion solution on ice. For the brain, infarcted regions were dissected and digested for 30 min at 37 °C in an enzyme cocktail containing: 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase; 8.5 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dispase; 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Nα-tosyl-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride; 5 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I in 9.64 ml HBSS without calcium, magnesium, or phenol red (Fisher Scientific, 14175-095).

Neutrophils from sorting or in vitro cultures were co-culture at a 2:1 ratio with SIINFEKL-activated OT-1 T effector cells for 3 h. Neutrophil-OT-I cells were then seeded on top of B16F10-OVAGFP target cells 1:2 ratio. After 24 h, live cells were stained with 0.4 g l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, HT90132). The area covered by target cells was quantified from micrographs of the plates using the ImageJ software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;In vivo Matrigel plug assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty thousand neutrophils sorted from tissues of interest were resuspended in 500 µl of growth-factor-depleted Matrigel (Corning) and injected subcutaneously in the lower back of anaesthetized mice to form plugs. At days 3 and 7 after implantation, the same number of sorted neutrophils was resuspended in 50 µl of PBS and injected directly into the plug respectively. On day 9 after implantation, Doppler laser perfusion imaging was performed at the lower back region that contained the Matrigel plugs. One ROI was defined for each observable Matrigel plug, and the amount of flux variation in each ROI was quantified. Only ROIs that were not obscured by hair regrowth were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Chemotaxis assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotaxis assays were performed as described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Adrover, J.

In brief, mice were anaesthetized in an isoflurane vapourizer chamber, and the backs were thoroughly shaved. The mice were placed in the imaging platform and images were captured using the power colour Doppler-3D mode. A total of 100 images were captured to generate a 3D reconstruction of the vasculature. Vevo LAB software was used to calculate the Volume and per cent vascularization of tumours. Per cent vascularization is determined by calculating the percentage of pixels in the volume that have a power Doppler signal associated with them, the presence of this signal indicates the presence of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;NET formation assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight hours after cytokine treatment, 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; bone marrow neutrophils were plated with RPMI medium on poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine-covered 8-well μ-Slides (Ibidi), and left 30 min to adhere.

During the first 8 days of differentiation (days 0–7), cells were maintained in a myeloid cell expansion medium—RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; SCF, 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-3 and 1 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; G-CSF. The medium was changed every two days. On day 8 of culture, the medium was replaced with a granulocytic cell differentiation medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; G-CSF). The medium was changed every 2 days until day 14. On day 13 of differentiation, cells were collected and counted. 800,000 cells were lysed for RNA isolation, 50,000 cells for FACS, and 40,000 cells for cytospins. The remaining cells were resuspended in fresh granulocytic differentiation medium at a seed density of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml and divided into 4 groups. Group one was maintained in granulocytic differentiation medium, group two was treated with 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; TGFβ, group three was treated with 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IFNβ (refreshed after 24 h), and group 4 was treated with 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; GM-CSF.

In brief, HOXB8 progenitors were transduced with lentiCas9-v2 lentiviral vectors encoding guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the following genes and exons: &lt;i&gt;Cebpb&lt;/i&gt; (exon 1; gRNA: AGGCTCACGTAACCGTAGT); &lt;i&gt;Klf6&lt;/i&gt; (exon 1; gRNA: TCGCTGTCGGGAAAACAGGG); &lt;i&gt;Runx1&lt;/i&gt; (exon 3; gRNA: TAGCGAGATTCAACGACCTC); &lt;i&gt;Rfx2&lt;/i&gt; (exon 5; gRNA: CTGCTGGGGGCGTAAAGCTG); &lt;i&gt;Relb&lt;/i&gt; (exon 4; gRNA: CTGCACGGACGGCGTCTGCA); &lt;i&gt;Irf5&lt;/i&gt; (exon 2; gRNA: ACCCTGGCGCCATGCCACGAGG); and &lt;i&gt;Junb&lt;/i&gt; (exon 1; gRNA: GGAACCGCAGACCGTACCGG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;JUNB overexpression&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentiviral vectors for JUNB overexpression were generated by transient transfection of HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were co-transfected with: (1) a transfer plasmid containing the &lt;i&gt;Junb&lt;/i&gt; cDNA under the control of the human PGK promoter; (2) packaging plasmid psPax2; and (3) envelope plasmid pMD2.G encoding VSV-G. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection. At 72 h, virus-containing supernatant was collected, clarified by centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), filtered (0.45 μm), and concentrated via ultracentrifugation (26,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C). Viral pellets were resuspended in cold PBS, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;Lentiviral transduction of HOXB8&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOXB8 progenitors were transduced by spinoculation. In brief, 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells were plated per well in 6-well plates with 1 ml of medium. Lentiviral particles were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 11.24 for the vector pRRL-hPGK-JUNB-IRES-eGFP and MOI = 1.8 for the pRRL-hPGK-IRES-eGFP empty vector, and cells were centrifuged at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 90 min at 30 °C. Following transduction, cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in fresh culture medium at a final concentration of 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Plasmid construction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To construct the JUNB expression vector, the human PGK (hPGK) promoter was PCR-amplified with ClaI and XbaI restriction sites and cloned into the ClaI/XbaI sites of the pRRL-CMV-IRES-eGFP vector, replacing the CMV promoter. The &lt;i&gt;Junb&lt;/i&gt; coding sequence was amplified from mouse cDNA using primers containing BglII and XhoI sites and inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the modified vector. Cloning was performed using the following primers: hPGK forward (ClaI): 5′-TTTTTTATCGATGGGTAGGGGAGGCGCTTT-3′; hPGK reverse (XbaI): 5′-TTTTTTTTAGACGAAAGGCCCGGAGATGA-3′; &lt;i&gt;Junb&lt;/i&gt; forward (BglII): 5′-TTTTTTAGATCTGCCACCATGTGCACGAAAATGGAACA-3′; &lt;i&gt;Junb&lt;/i&gt;reverse (XhoI): 5′-TTTTTTCTCGAGTCAGAAGGCGTGTCCCTT-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;Culture of HOXB8 cells&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the flow cytometry and bulk RNA-sequencing experiments, HOXB8 progenitors at day 3.5 of differentiation were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium (vehicle) or treated with GM-CSF (10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 48 h, following the same conditions described for primary bone marrow neutrophil cultures. Vehicle or GM-CSF treated cells were collected at 48 h after treatment for the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec50"&gt;Bulk RNA sequencing of mice and human-derived neutrophils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA from isolated mouse neutrophils was extracted using RNAeasy micro kit (Quiagen). RNA quality was checked using capillary electrophoresis (Agilent). Samples were submitted for whole RNA next generation sequencing in the Genomics Unit of CNIC. Total RNA (200 ng) was used to generate barcoded RNA-sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library preparation kit (New England Biolabs). Libraries were sequenced with HiSeq2500 (Illumina) to generate 50-nucleotide single reads, with a minimum of 8 million reads per sample. For RNA-seq of human-derived neutrophils, we isolated RNA from a total of 800,000 differentiated neutrophils collected on day 13 and 15. We used the NucleoSpin RNA Mini Kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740955.50), following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was assessed with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher), and a total of 400 ng RNA was sequenced. RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, with RNA integrity number (RIN) between 9.8 and 10.0. RNA samples were processed by Novogene for library preparation and sequencing, and all samples passed the quality control criteria. Strand-specific libraries were generated on the basis of Novogene’s standard protocol. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina platform to produce 150 bp pairwise reads (PE150) per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FastQ files for each sample were obtained using CASAVA (v.1.8) software (Illumina). Reads were further processed with RTA (v.1.18.66.3). FastQ files for each sample were obtained using bcl2fastq (v.2.20.0.422) software (Illumina).

The resulting suspensions were filtered through cell strainers, and sorted in BD Aria Cell Sorter as DAPI&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;LY6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, and loaded into a BD Rhapsody cartridge. For the generation of single-cell whole-transcriptomes, we used a BD Rhapsody system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cell suspensions from each condition were incubated with Sample Tags (BD) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times and pooled in a single tube. Cell viability and concentration were assessed using a Countess III cell counter (Thermo Fisher). Sixty thousand cells were loaded into a Rhapsody Single Cell Analysis System cartridge. Cell capture and cDNA synthesis were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions; cells were isolated into nanowells by gravity, then cells were lysed and mRNAs together with sample tags oligonucleotides were released and captured by the beads present in the nanowells. Each bead contained a unique oligonucleotide named ‘cell label’ to identify each individual bead. All beads present in the cartridge were collected and cDNA synthesis took place in a single reaction. At this point, each cDNA and Sample Tag oligonucleotide were attached to its corresponding cell label oligonucleotide. Two separated indexed libraries were prepared for whole-transcriptome analysis and sample tag demultiplexing following the manufacturer’s instructions. The average size of the libraries was calculated using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and the concentration was determined using the Qubit fluorometer (Thermofisher). Finally, libraries were combined and sequenced together in a paired-end run (60 × 42) using a NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) and a P2 flow cell. Output files were processed with NextSeq 1000/2000 Control Software Suite v.1.4.1.

The Seurat suite was used to integrate the neutrophils from all datasets using Seurat’s integration implementation. This method uses common sources of variation across the different datasets and aligns the cells so those in similar biological states cluster together. The integrated dataset was used to perform the unbiased cluster analysis and the construction of NeuMap. Additionally, we used the integrated NeuMap to generate a reference which we later used to analyse additional and external datasets by projecting cells onto our reference and annotate the new data using our custom labels using Seurat’s MapQuery and TransferData. This method is technology agnostic, so we could reliably project cells from external datasets sequenced in different platforms onto NeuMap&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Guo, M. et al.

Resolutions used ranged between 0.05 and 0.3. Clusters from different resolutions were selected because they best represented the expression of functional signatures projected onto NeuMap. Areas shown in the figures correspond to the q15 quantile of the KMASS algorithm, which calculates the density of cells in specific areas. For clarity, hubs in figures are shown as the area with the accumulation of 85% of cells for each selected cluster/hub. Analyses were performed on the complete set of cells for each cluster or hub. The FindAllMarkers() function from Seurat was used to calculate DEGs across the hubs. Only genes detected in a minimum of 25% of the cells and with an average of at least 0.25-fold difference (log scale) between the groups in either of the groups were tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Kernel density estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MASS R package (v.7.3.61) was used for two-dimensional kernel density estimation (K-mass score), with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 100 grid points in each direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56"&gt;Signature projection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signatures used for illustration of functional states are contained in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. All signatures were calculated by Seurat’s AddModuleScore() function. We used two different sources for the functional signatures: (1) previous publications, for which we provide the whole list of genes reported and used in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;; and (2) public databases such as gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In those cases the whole gene list from the functional category was tested. For signatures from human data, human genes were mapped to their corresponding mouse homologue to calculate the enrichment score using the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database. We used Seurat R package (v.5.2.1) AddModuleScore() function to calculate the scores. To generate visualization heat maps across NeuMap hubs, we first calculated enrichment scores for each cell. Scores were then averaged by hub and scaled per signature for comparison. To assess whether gene signature scores significantly differed across NeuMap hubs, we applied the Kruskal–Wallis test to each signature, testing the null hypothesis that score distributions were identical across hubs. The resulting test statistics were compared to a chi-squared distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the number of hubs minus one. To correct for multiple comparisons, we adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec57"&gt;Velocyto analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of expression dynamics in scRNA-seq data was performed using velocyto (v.0.17.17)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="La Manno, G. et al.

Pre-processing included gene selection by detection (the minimum number of both unspliced and spliced counts was set to 30), and by variability (keep 2,000 highly variable genes (HVGs)), normalization, and log1p transformation. First and second order moments were computed among 50 nearest neighbours in the principal component analysis (PCA) space using 30 components. Cell-based RNA velocities were estimated by modelling the transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using the stochastic model available in scVelo. Finally, these velocities were projected onto the previously computed UMAP and visualized at the cellular level or as velocity vector fields through streamlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some experiments we performed Pseudotime analysis. Samples were pre-processed using the standard Monocle3 pipeline. To address batch effects, samples were integrated using the Batchelor algorithm (v.1.20.0). Dimensionality reduction and clustering were performed within Monocle3 (v.1.3.7), and pseudotime values were computed for the integrated dataset. To evaluate the significance of differences in pseudotime values between Cre&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; control and &lt;i&gt;Tgfbr2&lt;/i&gt;-mutant immature cells, we applied a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction (&lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; = 373,675; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value = 0.005548).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58"&gt;Comparison of cell distribution in the different hubs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test differences in how neutrophils are distributed in the different hubs, we classified cell hubs for both mutant and control samples on the basis of the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest neighbours algorithm (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 5) of the cells projected onto Neumap. The observed hub proportions were calculated for each sample, and differences were determined by subtracting the proportions in control from the proportions in mutant cells. To assess the statistical significance of these differences, we used a bootstrap approach. For this, we generated a null distribution of hub proportion differences by merging each control–mutant pair into a mixed population. From this combined dataset, 10,000 resampled pairs were drawn with replacement, matching the sample sizes of the original control and mutant datasets. The differences in hub proportions between the resampled mutant and control groups were then calculated. The null distributions for each hub were verified to have a mean of 0.0, as expected under the null hypothesis. Finally, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the observed differences were computed by determining the fraction of resampled differences that were as extreme as or more extreme than the observed differences. To estimate 95% confidence intervals, the quantiles corresponding to the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the null distributions were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec59"&gt;Single-cell multiome using Dogma-seq&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression at single-cell resolution, we used the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform (10x Genomics). We collected neutrophils from bone marrow, spleen and lung (dataset 1) and LLC and spleen with LPS (dataset 2) from 8-to-12-week-old C57BL/6 mouse healthy blood was sequenced in both datasets as a quality control reference. Single-cell suspensions were prepared as described above. After staining, cells were washed, resuspended in sorting buffer, and incubated with DAPI (NBP2311561, Novus Biologicals) for 15 min prior to sorting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;LY6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils were sorted in equal proportions from each organ. Cells were then pooled and lysed in 100 µl of cold DIG lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.005% digitonin, 2 U μl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor) for 5 min on ice. Lysis was quenched with 1 ml of cold DIG wash buffer, followed by centrifugation at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 µl of 10x Genomics Nuclei Buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT (Sigma) and 2 U µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor (Roche) to a final concentration of 3,400 nuclei per µl. After additional washes and centrifugation, samples were processed for library preparation at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library construction was performed following the 10x Genomics protocol (Chromium Next GEM Multiome ATAC + GEX v.1.1, CG000338 rev. E). In brief, nuclei underwent transposition using the ATAC transposition mix and were loaded onto the Chromium Controller for GEM generation, barcoding, and reverse transcription. Separate libraries were constructed for ATAC and gene expression using standard amplification and indexing steps. Libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and Qubit (ThermoFisher), pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (paired-end, 150 bp) with a target depth of 75 million reads per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec60"&gt;Data processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec61"&gt;Initial quality control and cell filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA accessibility and gene expression from each cell were analysed simultaneously using Seurat (v.4.0.5 and v.4.3)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Hao, Y. et al.

FindTransferAnchors() function to identify pairwise correspondences (anchors) between the reference and query datasets using the transcriptomics data. This function uses canonical correlation analysis and mutual nearest neighbours to identify cells with similar gene expression profiles across the two datasets. The top 2,000 variable features shared between the reference and query datasets were used for anchor identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The query dataset was mapped onto the NeuMap reference using the MapQuery() function. This step projected the query cells from the Dogma-seq into NeuMap embedding space, allowing direct comparison and visualization of the dogma cells relative to NeuMap. Hub annotations from NeuMap were transferred to the query dataset using the TransferData() function. This function predicts cell labels for each query cell on the basis of the similarity scores computed from the anchors. The predicted labels were assigned to the query dataset, enabling downstream analysis of chromatin state in cells from each hub.

Samples were collected from healthy donors, patients, or perfused organ donors. Specifically, healthy donor samples (bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood) were randomly collected without self-selection or recruitment bias. Other healthy tissues were obtained from anonymous acute-death donors without chronic inflammation to minimize the confounding effects of death shock on the organs. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient samples (umbilical cord and peripheral blood) were randomly selected from pregnant patients with an active disease state (SLEPDAI &amp;gt; 5) and without other chronic inflammatory comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood and bone marrow were collected in BD vacutainer K2E (EDTA) tubes (BD Healthcare, 367525) to prevent coagulation. Erythrocytes were lysed in 5–10 ml 1× red blood cells (RBC) lysis buffer (diluted from 10× BD Pharm Lyse, 555899) for 5 min for twice to deplete erythrocytes and then washed and re-suspension. Spleen, lung, omentum, mesentary fat, perirenal fat, liver, colon and rectum tissues were minced into small pieces and digested for 30 min at 37 °C in a mixture of collagenase IV (385 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Sigma) and DNase I (2.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Sigma) and the samples were homogenized into single-cell suspension using syringe plungers and passed through 70-μm cell strainers (15-1070, BIOLOGIX). Then the samples were lysed in 2 ml 1× RBC lysis buffer (diluted from 10× BD Pharm Lyse, 555899) for 3 min to deplete erythrocytes and then washed and resuspended. Endometrium was cut into small pieces and enzymatically digested with the Tumor Dissociation Kit (130-095-929, Miltenyi Biotec). After digestion, the cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm cell strainers and subjected to a 3-min erythrocyte lysis with 2 ml 1× RBC lysis buffer, followed by washing and re-suspension.All single-cell suspensions were incubated with Fc-blocker (Human TruStain FcXTM, 422302, Biolegend) for 30 min on ice, then stained for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark with Fixable Viability Stain 700 (564997, BD Biosciences) (1:1,000), and the following antibodies: Anti-CD19-PE-Cy7 (clone HIB19, BioLegend, 302216; 1:200); anti-CD3-PE-Cy7 (clone HIT3a, BioLegend, 300316; 1:200); anti-CD45-APC-Cy7 (clone HI30, BioLegend, 304014; 1:200); anti-CD56-PE-Cy7 (clone 5.1H11, BioLegend, 362510; 1:200). All antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution unless otherwise indicated. After washing with FACS buffer, cells were sorted on a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

Lysis, reverse transcription and exonuclease I digestion were performed using BD Rhapsody Enhanced Cartridge Reagent Kit (BD Bioscience, 664887) and the BD Rhapsody cDNA Kit (BD Bioscience, 633773). The whole-transcriptome libraries were prepared by following the BD Rhapsody single-cell whole-transcriptome amplification workflow with the BD Rhapsody WTA Amplification Kit (BD Bioscience, 633801), including random priming and extension (RPE), RPE amplification PCR and whole-transcriptome amplification index PCR.

Gene lists of interest shown here were obtained from public data and repositories (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), from ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Wu, Y. et al.

For each gene list, we used AddModuleScore() to calculate the aggregated module score against a set of control genes with similar expression, thus ensuring the score was not biased by overall expression levels. To identify human to mouse hub similarities gene lists of interest were obtained from NeuMap hub gene lists. For each gene list, we used AddModuleScore() to calculate the aggregated module score against a set of control genes with similar expression. For all gene module scoring, we reduced the control gene parameter to 80 to ensure sufficient background correction while maintaining computational feasibility within the reduced gene number in the integrated dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm at several resolution. Clusters with high expression of functional scores were selected as hubs, keeping only cells uniquely assigned to each specific cluster or hub. This approach led to the identification of six human NeuMap regions shown in Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#MOESM1"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt;. For visualization purposes, we used two-dimensional kernel density estimation on UMAP coordinates. For figure visualization, we calculated density values per hub using the kde2d function from the MASS R package (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 100 grid points) (v.7.3.61), selected cells above the 80th percentile of density (top 20% most accumulated cells) to define core regions representative of each defined hub. The FindAllMarkers() function with default parameters from Seurat was used to calculate DEGs shown is Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#MOESM6"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; across the human hubs. Spatial boundaries around these high-density regions were computed using the concaveman algorithm (v.1.1.0) to generate concave hull polygons that capture the geometric extent of each cell state cluster. For the stacked bars plots, all samples are downsampled to 1,000 cells for consistency with previous mouse NeuMap bars and comparability among samples with varying sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec76"&gt;Spatial transcriptomics using Visium OCT&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visualization of gene expression in naive lung (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1), tumour-bearing lungs (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) and flu-infected lung (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1) was performed using the 10x Visium Spatial Gene Expression Kit (10x Genomics; PN1000184) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The OCT blocks were cut using a cryostat (Leica; PN-CM1520) and first cuts were used for RNA extraction (Qiagen; PN-74034), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico chips (Agilent; PN- 5067-1513), ensuring a minimum RIN number of 7. Second, 10-μm sections were cut on the Visium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide (PN-1000193) to assess optimal tissue permeabilization time. FInally, a 10-μm section was mounted on a Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slide and then stained for H&amp;amp;E staining and imaged using the NanoZoomer S210 (Hamamatsu; NP-C13239) to assess tissue morphology and quality. Following protocol instructions, the sections were then permeabilized for 18 min, then tissue was lysed, and reverse transcription was performed followed by second strand synthesis and cDNA denaturation. Spatially barcoded, full-length cDNAs were amplified by PCR for 16 and 17 cycles, depending on the initial concentration previously determined by qPCR. Indexed sequencing libraries were generated via end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and sample index PCR. Size distribution and concentration of full-length GEX libraries were verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip (Agilent). Finally, sequencing of GEX libraries was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) aiming at approximately 40,000 pair-end reads per spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec77"&gt;Data pre-processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the analysis of the spatial transcriptomic data, SpaceRanger software (10x Genomics, v.1.3.0) was used to map the sequenced reads, correct amplification bias and obtain the count matrix.

Quality metrics were calculated on a per-slide basis to preserve biological variability. Differences in total UMI across spots were adjusted by log-normalization using the NormalizeData() function from Seurat. This function divides the raw gene counts for each cell by the total counts of that cell and multiplies it by the scale factor (10,000), which is then log-normalized as log(1+x).

In brief, the univariate linear model (ulm) approach was applied to compute similarity (enrichment) scores by testing the association between gene expression and the neutrophil hub signatures derived from our single-cell RNA-seq data, thereby quantifying signature activity within each Visium spatial transcriptomics spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To map neutrophil signatures from the spatial transcriptomic data onto NeuMap, we first carried out differential expression analysis across healthy, flu-infected, and cancer samples using the FindAllMarkers() function in Seurat (v.4.3), with a logistic regression framework. Genes were included if expressed in at least 25% of cells in one group and showed a minimum log-fold change of 0.25. Significance was defined by adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) with a threshold of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 50 significantly DEGs (ranked by log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fold change) were selected for module scoring using Seurat’s AddModuleScore() function.

Quality control was applied by removing unexpressed genes and low-quality cells on the basis of gene counts, UMI counts, and mitochondrial gene content. The dataset was normalized using SCTransform, followed by identification of HVGs (top 10%), scaling, and PCA using 30 (MI) to 40 (PDAC) components. Batch correction across samples was performed using FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData(). Clustering was performed with the Leiden algorithm (resolution = 0.5) after computing neighbours using the top 30–40 principal components. UMAP was used for visualization. We annotated cell-type identities using SingleR (v.2.6.0) with reference profiles from the MouseRNAseq ImmGen databases via the celldex package (v.1.14.0) and curated marker genes from the dataset’s own clustering results. Marker genes for each cell type were extracted using FindAllMarkers(). Cell-type-specific markers were used in subsequent annotation and deconvolution steps.

Spatial annotations were derived by integrating information from the Leiden clusters, cell-type deconvolution, histological inspection, and expression of cancer-specific signatures. GSEA and over-representation analyses were used to characterize and differentiate distinct tumour cores. Finally, to investigate spatial relationships between spots, we constructed a graph using the igraph::graph() function (v.2.1.4) on the basis of a distance matrix computed from spot coordinates (stats::dist()). The graph was tuned to include only immediate neighbours on the basis of the 2D spatial grid structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec83"&gt;Spatial analysis of human lung specimens using Visium HD&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human tissue microarray samples were used under protocol 2019-5253, which was reviewed and approved by the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) Research Ethics Board, specifically by the MUHC co-Chair of the Comité d’éthique de la recherche du CTGQ panel. Human lung tissue specimens were obtained through protocols approved by the McGill University Health Centre Institutional Review Board (IRB 2014-1119). From these samples, tissue microarrays were constructed by a pathologist on the basis of intratumoural neutrophil abundance, using 1-mm cores sampled from FFPE pulmonary invasive adenocarcinomas with high-grade predominant solid architecture and adjacent non-tumorous lung tissue. Samples were derived from eight patients. Sections (5 μm) were mounted onto Visium CytAssist HD slides (10x Genomics) and processed following the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, FFPE tissue sections underwent deparaffinization, decrosslinking, probe hybridization, ligation and extension, followed by spatial barcoding and sample indexing. Final library quality and fragment size were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip. Libraries were sequenced at the McGill University Genome Centre on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform (1.5B reads, PE100 per lane). Spatial gene expression data were processed using Space Ranger (10x Genomics), and high-resolution spatial transcriptomic profiles were generated for downstream analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FASTQ files from the Visium HD experiment were mapped to the GRCh38-2020-A reference genome using the Visium_Human_Transcriptome_Probe_Set_v2.0_GRCh38-2020-A probe set with Space Ranger (v.3.1.1, 10x Genomics). Sample areas were manually selected using Loupe Browser, and the registration file H1-RTF6MBB-A1-fiducials-image-registration.json was provided to spaceranger count via the --loupe-alignment argument. High-resolution H&amp;amp;E and CytAssist images were passed with the --image and --cytaimage arguments, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-level transcriptomic profiles were reconstructed using the Bin2cell package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Polański, K. et al.

First, an AnnData object was created with b2c.read_visium, then filtered to retain bins with at least one count and genes expressed in at least three spots (min_counts = 1, min_cells = 3). The H&amp;amp;E image was scaled using b2c.scaled_he_image with mpp = 0.38. Due to variability in bin sizing across the array, 2 μm bins exhibit slight differences in width/height, leading to a striped appearance. To correct this artefact, the b2c.destripe function was applied. Nuclei segmentation was then performed on the H&amp;amp;E using b2c.stardist with parameters: stardist_model = “2D_versatile_he”, prob_thresh = 0.1, and nms_thresh = 0.1. Segmented nuclei were expanded using b2c.expand_labels with algorithm = “volume_ratio”. To recover additional cells not segmented via H&amp;amp;E, the Stardist fluorescence model was applied to a σ-smoothed gene expression image generated using b2c.grid_image (mpp = 0.38, sigma = 5). b2c.stardist was re-run with stardist_model = “2D_versatile_fluo” and the same thresholds. Cells not segmented with the H&amp;amp;E-based model were assigned secondary labels from the fluorescence model. Finally, bins were grouped into cells with the b2c.bin_to_cell function. To reconstruct the Segmentation Polygon Mask we converted the.npz mask output from Bin2cell into a data frame using pd.DataFrame.from_dict (pandas v.2.2.3).

Additionally, cells labelled only through gene expression segmentation (secondary labels) were excluded upon manual inspection for falling outside tissue boundaries.

We then computed gene module scores for each hub using the AddModuleScore() function in Seurat. Module scores were calculated by averaging the expression of hub-associated genes and comparing them to control gene sets with similar expression levels, thereby normalizing for baseline expression and minimizing bias. For visualization, enrichment scores were averaged by hub across clusters and scaled per signature to enable comparison in the resulting heat map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec84"&gt;Neighbourhood analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial transcriptomic data were analysed using Seurat (v.4.3) in R (v.4.2). A spatial proximity graph was constructed by computing the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest neighbours (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 6) from each spot’s &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates using the RANN package (v.2.6.2). Edges exceeding 250 units in Euclidean distance were excluded to account for realistic cell–cell interaction radii. An undirected graph was generated using the igraph package, with edge weights corresponding to physical distances. We implemented two complementary functions to quantify spatial cell-type context: (1) neighbourhood frequency analysis. For a given set of target spots (for example, neutrophils), their first-order neighbours were identified within the spatial graph. For each neighbour, the cell-type label was extracted, the number of neighbouring cells of each type was counted per target spot and aggregated across all targets to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval for each cell type. This allowed identification of the most frequently co-localized cell types around a given population. (2) neighbourhood composition by Hub: In a separate analysis, both the target spot and its neighbours were pooled to represent a local “neighbourhood.” Cell types within each neighbourhood were classified using a curated cell-type annotation. For each neutrophil hub, cell-type counts were summed and normalized to percentages, excluding spots annotated as ‘unassigned’ to avoid skewing proportion estimates. This enabled comparative analysis of cellular composition across microenvironments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec85"&gt;MACSima imaging cyclic staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec86"&gt;Sample preparation and image acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplex immunohistochemistry of lungs from naive, flu-infected, or tumour-induced mice was performed using a MACSima imaging system (Miltenyi Biotec). In brief, cyclic immunofluorescence imaging consisting of repetitive cycles of immunofluorescent staining, sample washing, multi-field imaging, and signal erasure by photobleaching was performed. Cryosectioned fixated lungs from the 3 groups were placed on microscopy slides and MACSwell sample carriers were mounted and blocked using a blocking buffer containing 10% BSA and 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature before lungs were preincubated with an antibody to IFIT1 (ab236256, Abcam, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before samples were placed in the MACSima imaging system. Neutrophil subsets were identified using the following antibodies: anti-CD11b-APC (clone M1/70.15.11.5, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-113-239; 1:50); anti-CD45-FITC (clone REA737, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-110-658; 1:50); anti-CXCR2-PE (clone SA044G4, BioLegend, 149303; 1:50); anti-Ly6C-PE (clone REA796, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-111-916; 1:50); anti–MHC-II-APC (clone REA813, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-112-388; 1:50); anti-PD-L1-APC (clone 10 F.9G2, BioLegend, 124312; 1:50); anti-CD14-PE (clone Sa14-2, BioLegend, 150106; 1:50) Anti-IFIT1 (Polyclonal, Abcam, Ab70023; 1:50). Additionally, a conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich, F9887; 1:100) in the first cycle to identify IFIT1. The tissue location was characterized using anti-Podoplanin-PE (clone 8.1.1, BioLegend, 127408; 1:50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec87"&gt;Data analysis and visualization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images were stitched and pre-processed using MACS iQ View Analysis Software (Miltenyi Biotec, v.1.3.2) and representative overlay pictures were displayed. For downstream analysis, cells were segmented on the basis of the DAPI signal using the StarDist plugin in ImageJ (US National Institutes of Health) and the donut algorithm in MACS iQ View. The segmented data were then exported for further analysis to FlowJo (BD Biosciences), where neutrophils were identified as LY6G&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; cells using a threshold value. In flu-infected lungs, neutrophils were characterized as intravascular or extravasated on the basis of the podoplanin signal in the segmented neutrophils. Neutrophils from all ROIs were concatenated and phenotypically analysed by dimensional reduction using the UMAP plugin and unsupervised clustering using the FlowSOM plugin. FlowJo and R were used for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec88"&gt;Mathematical modelling for blood neutrophil diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model the predictive value of the distribution of blood neutrophils in NeuMap, we used the density overlap represented by the Bhattacharyya index. We favoured density versus spatial overlap to reduce the impact of outliers in our calculations. We also favoured using ten selected regions of NeuMap over the seven hubs delineated in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt; to gain spatial resolution of cell distribution over the specific areas of NeuMap where blood neutrophils from the tested conditions tended to concentrate. In separate analyses, we found that the spatial overlap was not based on densities, and the use of seven hubs provided significantly less resolution in the overlap barcodes (not shown).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec89"&gt;Density state estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UMAP coordinates &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\{{x}_{j},{y}_{j}\}\)&lt;/span&gt; of the neutrophils collected from the tissue hubs and blood samples were pipelined into a computational approach to estimate the probability density functions (PDFs) over the Neumap transcriptomic space associated with these datasets.

This kernel choice, which is symmetric and normalized along each orthogonal direction, ensures a smooth, bounded and efficient computation of the density estimates. The determination of each kernel’s bandwidths, which influences the smoothness and accuracy of the resulting PDF estimate, was made via the Sheather–Jones method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Köhler, M., Schindler, A. &amp;amp; Sperlich, S.

This technique uses a data-driven approach that minimizes the mean integrated square error of the estimated density function. By iteratively adjusting the bandwidths &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and evaluating their performance, Sheather–Jones effectively balances bias and variance, resulting in accurate density estimates, particularly for tissue hubs and blood samples that present non-Gaussian distributions or multimodality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec90"&gt;Overlap integration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon estimating the PDFs of our datasets, we assessed the degree of overlap between pairs of these functions. For this purpose, we used the Bhattacharyya index, which yields a measure of the amount of overlap between two PDFs &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(f(x,y)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(g(x,y)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The Bhattacharyya index was defined by the integral expression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{BC}(\,f,g)=\iint \sqrt{f(x,y)g(x,y)}{\rm{d}}x{\rm{d}}y,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the double integral runs over the entire domain defined by NeuMap. The Bhattacharyya index gives a scalar value in the interval [0, 1], enabling a direct interpretation of the overlap: values near 1 suggest a high degree of similarity, or almost perfect overlap, between the two distributions, indicating that the neutrophil states are nearly indistinguishable within the dimensionally reduced transcriptomic space. Conversely, values near 0 denote little to no overlap, pointing to distinct neutrophil states with minimal similarity in their respective distributions within the dimensionally reduced transcriptomic space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the Bhattacharyya index, we used an adaptive Monte Carlo method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Dunn, W. L. &amp;amp; Shultis, J. K. Exploring Monte Carlo Methods (Elsevier, 2022)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#ref-CR89" id="ref-link-section-d98354572e5396"&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that combines adaptive importance and stratified samplings over multiple iterations, thus optimizing the sample distribution around the peaks of the PDFs and thereby reducing the standard deviation in the estimates. This approach yielded accurate values of the multidimensional integrals and hence offered robust measures of the overlap between the PDFs. While the Bhattacharyya index does not constitute a true probability measure, its bounded nature makes it a valuable score for comparing the similarity of data distributions in a normalized manner. From the computed Bhattacharyya indexes, the resulting barcodes were generated. To perform our calculations, we used the R programming language to analyse all datasets. Specifically, we used the MASS, graphics, stats and vegas R packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec91"&gt;Estimation of neutrophil lifetimes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the neutrophil half-lives and transit times, we used an age-structured mathematical model as previously proposed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Ballesteros, I. et al. Co-option of neutrophil fates by tissue environments. Cell 183, 1282–1297.e18 (2020)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d98354572e5409"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This model effectively captures the temporal variation in the proportion of labelled neutrophils following the administration of the BrdU pulse. Let &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(u=u(t,a)\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the density of neutrophils, which at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, have an age &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. We assume that their age ranges in the interval &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(a\in [0,{a}_{\max }]\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({a}_{\max }\)&lt;/span&gt; is the maximum age (or the maximum lifespan) a neutrophil can achieve in the different examined tissues. In practice, this age can be taken sufficiently large without appreciably altering the numerical results for the entire neutrophil population. To describe the temporal dynamics of the age distribution in neutrophils, we considered the following first-order linear transport partial differential equation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial a}=-\frac{u(t,a)}{\tau (a)}+\phi (t,a).$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (1)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The left-hand side of equation (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="equation anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#Equ4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) represents the temporal change in the number of neutrophils along with their corresponding age. The first term on the right-hand side accounts for neutrophil death. The death time, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\tau (a)\)&lt;/span&gt;, generally depends on the age of the neutrophil. The introduction of a flux function, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\phi (t,a)\)&lt;/span&gt;, encapsulates the net recruitment of neutrophils entering or leaving the target tissue. Assuming that at time &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(t=0\)&lt;/span&gt; no BrdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-labelled neutrophils of any age have yet arrived at tissue &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, the initial condition is &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(u(0,a)=0\)&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore, the exact solution to (1), obtained using the method of characteristics for first-order partial differential equations, is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${u}_{i}(t,a)={{\rm{e}}}^{-{\int }_{0}^{t}\frac{{\rm{d}}\xi }{{\tau }_{i}(a-\xi )}}{\int }_{0}^{t}{\phi }_{i}(\xi ,a-t+\xi ){{\rm{e}}}^{{\int }_{0}^{\xi }\frac{{\rm{d}}\eta }{{\tau }_{i}(a-t+\eta )}}{\rm{d}}\xi .$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;

Once these four parameters were found for each tissue &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, the mean half-life time &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{1/2}^{(i)}\)&lt;/span&gt; and transit time &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{\mathrm{tran}}^{(i)}\)&lt;/span&gt; were estimated from the normalized profile (equation (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="equation anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#Equ8"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;)). To do that, the transit time was identified as the time at which this unimodal profile achieves its maximum (100% of the BrdU-labelled neutrophils in tissue &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;). Subsequently, the 50% level was set as a reference for the mean half-life time &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{1/2}^{(i)}\)&lt;/span&gt;. The approach for calculating these two lifetimes is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09807-0#Fig12"&gt;7f&lt;/a&gt;. The bands shown in this figure correspond to a confidence level of 0.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the density state estimation and overlap integration, we used the R programming language to analyse all datasets.

          &lt;p&gt;This will be brief because I have written about it before.  The White House cover-up artists have stated that the bruises on the President’s right hand are due to his use of aspirin and trauma from shaking hands.  But the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend AGAINST the use of aspirin in individuals 70 years or older due to the increased risk of internal bleeding EXCEPT if they have evidence of cardiovascular disease or a history of a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, etc).  As far as I am aware, the venous stasis problems that Donald  admits to is not an indication for aspirin, even to prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo, either the President’s physician is incorrectly prescribing aspirin or Donald is ducking the fact that he’s had an event or has evidence of cardiovascular disease that he, his physician and those around him are covering up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have hoped that the legacy media would have promoted this story by now.  I guess it remains for us to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

To the untrained eye, they basically look the same as what you’d expect a sauna to look like—wood paneling, benches, some guy who just had to bring his phone inside—and both actually share a bunch of the same health benefits. But why does every gym, wellness club, and boutique &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-get-the-benefits-of-hiit-workouts-without-burning-out"&gt;HIIT workout&lt;/a&gt; studio suddenly seem to have these new-wave sweat boxes in their &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gq-125-rules-for-modern-gentlemen-manners-etiquette-guide"&gt;locker rooms&lt;/a&gt;? For one, it’s a matter of practicality. Infrared saunas give off way less heat, thus making the surrounding area a much more habitable place for those who’d prefer not to partake. But, more importantly, the wellness industry loves a shiny new thing—especially one that conveniently doesn’t give club members the tools to burn down the building. And, as it turns out, infrared saunas actually have some unique benefits of their own. (For one, they’re less likely to overheat your iPhone, not that we’d know anything about that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared vs. traditional sauna: What’s the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, there are several variations of saunas, but they mostly tend to get lumped into two categories: traditional and infrared. A true traditional sauna, also called a Finnish sauna, uses a wood fire to heat stones, which in turn heat the air inside the sauna. Nowadays, you can also find electric saunas (these tend to get filed under “traditional”), which also use stones, but the stones are heated by electricity rather than fire. Traditional saunas can maintain temperatures between 150-220 degrees Fahrenheit. “These typically operate at higher temperatures with dry heat, inducing intense sweating,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/"}' href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Setareh, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, director of clinical cardiology at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional saunas, Infrared saunas do not have a central heat source. Instead, they utilize ceramic or metallic panels to emit far-infrared light. “An infrared sauna uses infrared light to directly heat your body, rather than heating the air around you like a traditional sauna,” Dr. Setareh says. Hence, infrared saunas are able to operate at much lower temperatures—between 100–165 degrees—while still giving you a similar, albeit decidedly less intense, sensation to sitting in a traditional sauna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Setareh, “both types of saunas share common benefits—like improving circulation, promoting relaxation, and encouraging recovery,” and studies have also found both to have positive effects on lowering &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-watchs-new-hypertension-feature-could-save-your-life"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are some important differences that may influence which type of sauna is ultimately best for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional saunas seem to be better for cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research, including a landmark 2015 Finnish &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2130724"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that surveyed 2,315 men over the course of two decades, has long associated sauna use with heart health and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. But it wasn’t until a recent &lt;a data-offer-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025"}' href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published earlier this year in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Physiology,&lt;/em&gt; that researchers have formally begun weighing the benefits of traditional saunas against their infrared counterparts. (This latest study also compared both types of sauna to a hot tub, which surprisingly emerged as &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/are-hot-tubs-actually-better-for-you-than-saunas#:~:text=Traditional%20saunas%20are%20usually%20heated,at%20just%20over%20100%20degrees."&gt;the most beneficial of the three&lt;/a&gt; when it came to promoting heart health.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that the far-infrared sauna, by far, showed the least [noticeable] rise in core body temperature—and therefore had the least cardiovascular impact,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson"}' href="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christopher T.

The mice were tested for changes in memory and motor function over a 12-week period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior tests on the mice showed that hydrogen sulfide improved cognitive and motor function by 50 percent compared to mice that did not receive the injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice that received the treatment were better able to remember the locations of platform edits and appeared more physically active than the mice that had simulated Alzheimer’s disease but did not receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide, but the researchers wanted to investigate how the brain chemically reacted to the gaseous molecule,” Johns Hopkins Medicine &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease"&gt;wrote in a press release about the study. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-272427"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). When there are healthy levels of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β acts as a signaling molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that in the absence of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β is overattracted to another protein in the brain called Tau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When GSK3β and Tau interact, Tau causes clumps inside nerve cells. As those clumps grow, the tangled proteins block communication between the nerves, eventually causing them to die, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease,” the press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cascade of events is important to designing therapies that can block this interaction like hydrogen sulfide is able to do,” Ph.D student Daniel Giovinazzo, the first author of the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, researchers lacked the tools to mimic how the body makes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The compound used in this study does just that and shows by correcting brain levels of hydrogen sulfide, we could successfully reverse some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease,” collaborator Dr. Matt Whiteman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNVG1LVFJ3Zk5BYkZ5cnF4LWJCeDB0LVVnOFY3bE5GWkw0SmVLRU5uOUhWTTNqQ0R5TlN4QzdJc2phZ3FWVVRNaGR5M0JieDNpZDdBTGFXa1pJb1NOc0g1OThKLXkwcnpuQ2ZfVm5vNEVpdS01TE55aERYQ1ZYNHNEUWM3a0hDTWFRS0pxLUJKRUVmaHVqVThWc1ZKdDhZUQ</guid></item><item><title>拥有22年经验的癌症外科医生分享“1个常见习惯” ，默默破坏您的免疫系统|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cancer-surgeon-with-22-years-of-experience-shares-the-1-common-habit-silently-destroying-your-immune-system-101764775091750.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101764775091750 " data-vars-storyid="101764775091750" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Akanksha Agnihotri" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set" data-story-title="Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares the ‘1 common habit’ silently destroying your immune system" data-collapse-article="true"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares the ‘1 common habit’ silently destroying your immune system&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Published on: Dec 03, 2025 09:01 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;Always scrolling late or binge-watching shows?

And that key is sleep. Poor sleep weakens your immunity. When your sleep is disturbed, your body becomes more susceptible to fatigue, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/diabetes" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, autoimmune disorders, and many other illnesses,” Dr Krishna explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds, “Our body has the natural ability to fight diseases, but we don’t use it properly. This is because during sleep time, we are often glued to our phones. To reduce inflammation in our body, we need proper sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to strengthen your immunity through sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Krishna further explains the science behind it, “When we stay awake, the hormone melatonin, which is the sleep hormone, doesn’t get a chance to work.&lt;/span&gt; And this is why our &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/immune-system" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="immune system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; cannot recharge. To strengthen our immunity, we need to let our system recharge, and proper sleep is essential for that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He advises prioritising consistent, uninterrupted sleep to allow the body to heal, recharge, and maintain a strong defence against illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

People experience midday energy drops that make them crave sugary snacks. But this isn’t just due to stress. It is often your hormones asking for some care. By balancing your hormones, you can boost your energy, improve your mood, and feel better overall. You don’t have to follow complicated diets or splurge on supplements you may not even need. Sometimes, it’s just as simple as adding the right foods to your meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/03/550x309/_a2af5730-a8fc-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c_1764744556552.jpg" alt="Which food can I eat to balance my hormones?(Adobe Stock)" title="Which food can I eat to balance my hormones?(Adobe Stock)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/03/550x309/_a2af5730-a8fc-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c_1764744556552.jpg" alt="Which food can I eat to balance my hormones?(Adobe Stock)" title="Which food can I eat to balance my hormones?(Adobe Stock)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Which food can I eat to balance my hormones?(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What food gives you the highest energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Prarthana Shah (MBBS, MSc, Integrative Health Coach) shares six hormone-friendly foods that keep you energised all day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1. Hydrate for your hormones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even slight dehydration can lower your energy, cause fatigue, and affect your thinking. Water is used to transport nutrients, remove toxins, and regulate their metabolism, which are necessary for maintaining your hormone balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drinking at least 8 cups of water every day can also help you stay hydrated, as can fruits, vegetables, and herbal teas. Electrolytes, like those in coconut water or natural sports drinks, help with rehydration, especially after exercise or in hot weather. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Simple habits can make staying hydrated easier, like starting your day with warm water and lemon or keeping a water bottle with you”, Dr Prarthana Shah, Integrative Health Coach, tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/5-simple-ways-to-drink-more-water-and-stay-hydrated-this-winter/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;You can make drinking water more enjoyable by infusing it with fruits like berries or by adding herbs like mint, which can also help support your hormones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2. Protein first, always&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is an important nutrient for your body, which helps keep your blood sugar levels steady. Eating a breakfast rich in protein can help prevent the mid-morning energy drop many of us experience. Research published in Advances in Nutrition shows that consuming 15–20 grams of protein at breakfast can improve your mood and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/always-reaching-for-snacks-at-work-5-healthy-office-snacks-that-keep-your-energy-levels-up-boiled-corn-chana-and-more-101758545855855.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="energy levels"&gt;energy levels&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foods like eggs, Greek yoghurt, lentils, and tofu can help you feel full longer and lower your stress hormone, cortisol. “Starting your day with protein gives you steady energy and enables you to avoid cravings for sugary snacks”, says the expert. Enjoying a veggie omelette or a creamy bowl of Greek yoghurt with fresh fruit both help you &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-your-energy-low-in-the-morning-try-these-5-nutrient-rich-breakfast-options-that-balance-your-hormones-101742632644868.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="balance your hormones"&gt;balance your hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is very important for steady energy. Dietary fiber helps control how quickly your body absorbs sugars, which prevents sudden energy spikes and crashes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that women aim for about 25 grams of fiber per day and men aim for about 38 grams, underscoring the importance of fibre for our overall health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Eat whole grains, chia seeds, oats, beans, and a variety of vegetables to boost your fiber intake, which will help you feel full longer and improve your gut health.&lt;/span&gt; “A healthy gut helps balance your hormones, leading to stable energy levels," shares the expert. Next time you make a smoothie, add a tablespoon of chia seeds, or switch from white rice to brown rice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4. Healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy fats are important for making hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone. &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/avoid-eating-foods-rich-in-animal-protein-for-healthy-liver/story-a1V67C8PRdOfoHmX7R4nxN.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Eating foods"&gt;Eating foods&lt;/a&gt; like avocado, olive oil, nuts, and seeds can improve your hormonal health and boost your energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthy fats are important for hormone production and help keep your blood sugar levels stable. They slow digestion, preventing rapid spikes in glucose and helping maintain steady energy levels. “Omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like salmon, flaxseeds, and walnuts, can reduce inflammation and improve mood," says the doctor. A spoonful of nut butter with an apple or some guacamole with your meal can really boost your energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5. Magnesium-rich foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine gives you a quick energy boost, but magnesium helps provide longer-lasting energy. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This mineral plays many important roles, such as regulating stress hormones and assisting muscles to recover, which can improve your energy levels over time," says Dr Shah.&lt;/span&gt; The National Institutes of Health recommends that adult women aim for 310–320 mg of magnesium daily, while men should aim for 400–420 mg daily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in leafy greens like spinach, seeds, nuts, bananas, and dark chocolate. “When you have enough magnesium, you can feel less tired and irritable, and stay calm and focused throughout the day," says the health coach. Try adding spinach to your morning smoothie or having some dark chocolate as an afternoon snack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6. Slow carbs over fast carbs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates need a new look, especially slow-release carbs like sweet potatoes, quinoa, and oats, which help keep your blood sugar levels steady. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;On the other hand, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/lots-of-protein-no-sugar-no-fast-carbs-what-it-takes-to-be-lara-croft/story-kfBUfEusMSLjcEetlJ9WPP.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fast carbs"&gt;fast carbs&lt;/a&gt;, found in white bread and pastries, can cause quick spikes in blood sugar, followed by crashes that leave you feeling tired and unfocused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating slow-digesting carbs can help keep your energy steady and support your hormones. Combine these carbs with protein or healthy fats for balanced meals. For example, try quinoa with roasted vegetables, or oatmeal with a nut butter mix, to boost your energy and support your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note to readers:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;We're &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02673843.2019.1590851"&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2025.101237"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; how smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tech-insiders-are-shielding-their-children-from-the-tech-they-work-with"&gt;impact childhood&lt;/a&gt;, and the findings of a new study about young tweens on the cusp of adolescence make for some more uncomfortable reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the US have found that owning a phone at the age of 12 was associated with an increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genes-for-depression-can-affect-the-situations-we-find-ourselves-in"&gt;risk of depression&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, and insufficient sleep, compared to not having one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span&gt;iPhone launched less than 20 years ago, so for many kids now entering their teenage years, they've only ever known a world with phones. Studies like this are trying to tease apart the effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that we should view smartphones as a significant factor in teen health, approaching the decision to give a child a phone with care and considering potential impacts on their life and health," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;child and adolescent &lt;/span&gt;psychiatrist Ran Barzilay, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;Screen Time In Bed May Increase Insomnia Odds, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from 10,588 young people, collected as part of an &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/"&gt;ongoing study&lt;/a&gt; on adolescent brain development, provided a snapshot of participants' health at age 12, together with some evidence for the differences that getting a phone (or not) over the next year might make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers factored in other variables, such as demographics and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;, and found that at age 12, nearly 6.5 percent of those with phones had been given a diagnosis of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183974" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, compared to roughly 4.5 percent without phones. That's a seemingly small but meaningful statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For obesity, the respective figures were roughly 18 percent of smartphone users compared to 12 percent of 12-year-olds without these devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for sleep, 47 percent of 12-year-olds with phones reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; (less than nine hours a night) compared to 31 percent of their phone-less peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183977" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone.jpg" alt="Young kid on a phone" class="wp-image-183977 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers want to see further measures taken to protect kids from the potential harms of phones. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/girl-in-white-sweater-and-blue-denim-jeans-sitting-on-floor-zeCdye9bUmI"&gt;Bruce Mars/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids who had a phone by age 13 were more likely to report &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-simple-aspect-of-everyday-life-linked-to-better-wellbeing-study-finds"&gt;mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; (including depression) and insufficient sleep than those who didn't. However, there was no noticeable change in obesity risk over that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers admit that phone use can have benefits, as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/maybe-screen-time-isn-t-to-blame-for-teen-mental-health-after-all"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown, but they want to see more done to make sure that these devices are used responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many teens, smartphones can play a constructive role by strengthening social connections, supporting learning, and providing access to information and resources that promote personal growth," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Likewise, some families may view a smartphone as a necessity for safety or communication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some nuances in the data. For example, depression was measured as any period of depression during the life of the child so far, so it may have occurred &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/maybe-screen-time-isn-t-to-blame-for-teen-mental-health-after-all"&gt;before they got a phone&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not possible to draw any conclusions about cause and effect in an observational study like this, but the strength of the associations – plus the changes that were recorded between ages 12 and 13 as some kids got phones and others didn't – are worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings tie in with what we know about adults and smartphones: that these devices can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-why-smartphones-are-bad-for-our-brains"&gt;elevate stress&lt;/a&gt;, leave us feeling &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-even-more-research-confirming-how-distracting-our-phones-are"&gt;more distracted and drained&lt;/a&gt;, and reshape the way &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giving-up-your-phone-for-just-3-days-can-reshape-your-brain-activity"&gt;our brains are wired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the researchers want to look at how much screen time and different types of apps affect these results, how the findings might extend over longer periods of adolescence, and what countermeasures could be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-072941"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — It's flu season, and flu cases are on the rise across New York State.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald on Tuesday declared that influenza is prevalent in the state.  The state is now requiring that unvaccinated health care personnel wear masks in areas where patients and residents may be present.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The declaration that flu is prevalent across the state means health care facilities and agencies must require that personnel who are not vaccinated against the flu wear a mask to avoid exposing patients and residents to the flu virus,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a press release. “The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against infection and lessens symptoms if you get the flu. I encourage everyone 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and it’s not too late to protect yourself and your loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration includes health care and residential care facilities and agencies regulated by the State Health Department. Under the rules, personnel who have not received this season’s flu vaccine must wear surgical or procedure masks while influenza is considered prevalent in New York. The regulations will allow masks to be removed when workers accompany patients in the community, provide speech therapy services, or communicate with people who lip read.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State data through Nov. 22 show 17,783 positive flu cases have been reported across all 62 counties so far this season. Outside New York City, lab-confirmed flu cases rose 114% week over week, increasing from 1,688 to 3,619. In New York City, cases climbed 119%, rising from 1,890 to 4,146.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations due to influenza increased 99%, up from 208 the previous week to 413 statewide.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged New Yorkers last month to get the seasonal flu vaccine to prevent influenza-associated child deaths. During the 2024-2025 season, 27 deaths in children younger than 18 were reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqbalkf00003b6qgb5bg4c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood vaccine schedule in the United States could soon see major changes, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s handpicked advisers expected to revise the timing of hepatitis B shots for newborns and re-examine long-established vaccination practices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnms00043b6qagnrg9am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hepatitis B decision would be the most significant change to the childhood vaccine schedule yet under Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who is now secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. He abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the 17 sitting members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee earlier this year and replaced them with his own choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00053b6qj553v9zm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since then, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ priorities and processes have changed, resulting in chaotic meetings and votes that risk &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/vaccines-city-health-officials"&gt;limiting access &lt;/a&gt;to vaccines or stray from data-driven decision-making of the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00063b6qq89hwakx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; for this week’s meeting offers scant details about what will be presented or by whom. Thursday’s meeting will include discussion and voting on whether to delay hepatitis B vaccination, which is currently recommended for babies just after birth. Friday’s schedule includes more discussion on vaccine ingredients and timing but no planned votes. Reference documents and voting language typically posted ahead of meetings have not yet been made available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrkti00023b6qorj8mzr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The consequences of the committee’s votes and plans can have big implications for vaccination in the United States. ACIP’s recommendations shape doctors’ guidance to patients as well as state vaccine policy, insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe2bjw000j3b6qqcwgqtt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee has already made some changes. In June, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/health/cdc-acip-vaccines-rsv-thimerosal"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; thimerosal-free vaccines, although there’s no evidence of harm from the vaccine preservative. Then, in September, it recommended &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/cdc-vaccine-panel-acip-mmrv-hepatitis"&gt;splitting up&lt;/a&gt; the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine and announced plans to investigate long-settled vaccine science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe3bvr000m3b6q75v63ihq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly appointed committee has also seen shifts in its membership. This week, HHS announced that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-kulldorff"&gt;Dr. Martin Kulldorff,&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s recent chair, has left to take a new role within the agency. Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a cardiologist who has criticized the Covid-19 vaccine, will take over as the new chair.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00093b6qxxu613ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The moves come just after a top US Food and Drug Administration official said in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/vaccine-approval-process-fda-official"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt; that the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines to require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe435y000p3b6qkodmkcon@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The truth of the matter is, we know vaccines have saved lives. They are saving lives actively,” Dr. Raynard Washington, director of Mecklenburg County Public Health in North Carolina and head of the Big Cities Health Coalition, said ahead of the CDC advisers’ meeting. “They’re saving costs for our community, both in terms of financial cost — health care costs, health care resources — and expense on individuals’ lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000f3b6qldrljnnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahead of Thursday’s vote, it’s not clear what evidence is driving the CDC vaccine committee’s plans for hepatitis B vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiplrbkn00013b6q7tb1kqf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risks from the disease are significant: Viral infection can hide in the body for years, until it leads to liver failure, cirrhosis or cancer. No new studies have revealed safety concerns about the hepatitis B vaccine, and there has been a dramatic decline in cases among infants since 1991, when the CDC recommended universal vaccination for babies. Reported hepatitis B infections in infants plummeted from an estimated 18,000 cases every year to about 20 per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000h3b6qkppbkdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, anti-vaccine activists have long questioned the need for the birth dose of the vaccine, since hepatitis B is mainly transmitted through dirty drug needles or sexual activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000i3b6qj6ix63cy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would you give that to a 1-day-old child?” Kennedy asked &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeLW9s6NpS7w%26t%3D3257s&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7Ce8dd39b2642a4e6d307608de31c6a91f%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639002926496541546%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ssHsvTVq1%2FmmhdUGYiBXt48xgFzhO9kBv3ZXYtajrv4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;in a June town hall&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s really a profit motive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000j3b6quw4559f5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease experts say the sharp drop in case numbers show that the strategy works. It created a safety net for babies at risk from pregnant mothers or other family members who may not know they have the virus, and saved them from a life of tough treatments and constant dread of spreading the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000k3b6qnd5j5cfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I understand that babies, of course, are precious and appear to be quite vulnerable, but they’re also vulnerable to hepatitis B,” said Dr. Anthony Fiore, an infectious diseases physician and former CDC official.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000l3b6qv3ipbywc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have this opportunity to prevent a disease very easily that has very serious long-term consequences. There’s kind of no going back.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipj8u3000003b6qzahcbuwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he was 16, John Ellis Jr. went to the doctor with severe stomach pain. He was expecting to be sent home with Tums and advice to eat healthier, but blood tests revealed a terrifying surprise: chronic hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000t3b6qv55dj6g1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellis and his mom, a nurse, thought it was a mistake. There are highly effective vaccines — he’d gotten a dose in middle school — and they didn’t know anyone with hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000u3b6qvln2jql2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Ellis was born in 1990, just before the hepatitis B birth dose became standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000v3b6q2grw3i6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before 1991, mothers were recommended to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy so their babies could be vaccinated shortly after birth, if needed — a strategy the current CDC vaccine advisers&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-acip-hepatitis-mmrv-covid-vaccine"&gt; recommended&lt;/a&gt; at their last meeting. But tests were often lost or results were jumbled. Many patients weren’t tested at all. Even if a mother wasn’t infected, unvaccinated babies had no protection from other relatives, caregivers or peers who could spread the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000w3b6qp6tq85ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no way to know how Ellis became infected. Based on the scarring on his liver, his doctors estimated that it happened when he was 3 or 4. It could have been at day care, school or the dentist’s office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiplczma001v3b6qeq68wj2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What he knew at 16 was that his life was over.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000x3b6q6lm8fns2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought that I was not going to survive it,” said Ellis, who’s now 35 and lives in his hometown of Pensacola, Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000y3b6qyig2abwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults who are infected with hepatitis B usually clear it with no lasting effects. For kids, it’s different. About 90% of babies who are infected will carry the virus for life, and all the risks of organ failure, liver scarring or cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000z3b6q2cwnst37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new modeling study, released as a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank"&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; ahead of this week’s ACIP meeting, suggests that delaying babies’ hepatitis B vaccines for even a few months will drive up infections, long-term health complications and deaths. The researchers behind the analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, had previously developed hepatitis B vaccination models to inform ACIP decisions. So far, they say they haven’t heard from the committee about their new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100103b6qu71h3wzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study found that delaying the birth dose to 2 months for babies whose mothers are not known to have hepatitis B — either because they tested negative or because their results are unknown — could lead to at least 1,400 preventable infections among children and 480 deaths for each year the delay is in place. Delaying the dose for 12 years could surge preventable infections to 2,700 and deaths to nearly 800 for each year of the recommendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiq0lc3800023b6q9860n3l6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if there was “perfect adherence” to vaccine recommendations, a 2-month delay among children whose parents tested negative for hepatitis B would lead to 90 acute infections, 75 chronic infections and 29 deaths for every year of the policy. Delaying it by 12 years pushes those numbers even higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100113b6qa153uzq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Any delays would drive up health care costs by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars every year, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100123b6qm4q90zst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When it turns into a chronic disease, it does not have a cure, and so infections that progress to a chronic condition end up needing, potentially, a lot of medical management and care and monitoring throughout life,” said Dr. Eric Hall, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100133b6qs731qzzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My hope is that the committee understands that universal infant vaccination has been the cornerstone of hepatitis B elimination efforts” for decades, Hall said. “We’ve made a lot of good progress towards that, and it’s important that we don’t undo that important progress now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdvej000r3b6qgmcc0lf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellis’ diagnosis landed him with a liver biopsy, medication and regular visits to the doctor. He learned that hepatitis B didn’t mean his life was over. He began to exercise and ride his bike. Rather than hiding his condition, he wondered, what if he was radically open about it?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001a3b6qk63fguu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At 17, he organized a 1,200-mile bike ride from Pensacola to Philadelphia, where the Hepatitis B Foundation is based. He rode with his best friend and his grandma in a chase car. His high school principal spoke at their sendoff. They biked about 60 miles every day for weeks, and for the last stretch — just as Ellis turned 18 — they were joined by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning doctor who had discovered the hepatitis B virus and developed the vaccine against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001b3b6qw45kbz2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellis said it was “a full-circle moment.” He can see how science was helping him and others, and how his mom, friends and community surrounded him and showed what it meant to live with hepatitis B. Nearly two decades later, it’s still fresh in his mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001c3b6qbgfudlxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, Ellis said, his experience is not typical. He knows other hepatitis B patients whose families dismissed them. It can feel impossible to explain to friends or potential romantic partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001d3b6qoj6zhnai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said some of the rhetoric from the federal government paints everyone with hepatitis B as drug users or people with risky sexual behaviors, as if it makes it OK to “other” them. As if the disease could never hit that close to home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001e3b6qy6rbcbfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re people that got exposed. We didn’t ask for it,” Ellis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001f3b6qvdlsbksi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m like anybody else. I’m trying to live a full life and be as unburdened by my condition as I can.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001g3b6q3o4gwy26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far, he’s been fortunate. He owns his real estate business in his hometown and has lifelong friends. His viral load is low, and he’s generally healthy. But he wonders how long it will last. There’s a reason hepatitis B is called “the silent killer,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001h3b6qnvwe0436@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents can make their own vaccine decisions for their babies, he said, and they should be empowered with information, including the realities of the risks of hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001i3b6q56ieerid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we’re making it harder for people who do choose to vaccinate, that’s what I take issue with,” Ellis said. “I would much rather vaccination be available at birth than to have someone else live the experience that I’ve lived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001j3b6q76f9lbo4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m a living, breathing example of what the risks are.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

That’s not breaking news. Sugars and artificial flavors &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lack quality nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

But that’s not so healthy either. Recent research found that even &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/08/soda-diet-liver-disease-study-research/86579096007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;just one can of diet soda&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/12/can-you-get-diabetes-from-eating-too-much-sugar/71764449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; disease. Regular soda, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Yet, many Americans are addicted to fizzy drinks. And for those who wish to stop, cutting soda cold-turkey might not be a good idea — as some USA TODAY journalists &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/29/soda-health-side-effects-quitting-caffeine/86585472007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recently learned&lt;/a&gt; when we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People are struggling to stop even though they really want to,” explains Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “You go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s because soda &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/12/soda-addiction-science-sugar-caffeine/86963258007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;appeals to our brain’s instinctual desire&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/20/is-corn-syrup-bad-for-you/71848699007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; and fats that help us survive — and our bodies adapt to increasingly high exposure to these ingredients over time, raising tolerance and making quitting painful, Gearhardt explains. You may get headaches, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/31/why-am-i-so-angry-all-the-time/83835896007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;irritability&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about it as if you were quitting smoking,” Gearhardt says. “You need to know what are your cues? What are your triggers? What emotions set you off? Certain times of day? Certain people? … Then you can come up with plans for a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alternative that’s right for you has a lot to do with why you’re drinking soda in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Here's how to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The best soda alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people want caffeine, switching to coffee without sweetener is much healthier,” Gearhardt says, but she gives one warning: “Getting caffeine through soda gives energy much faster. You may not get as intense of a caffeine hit from coffee, so there might be a little bit of grieving … but that’s because we weren’t supposed to be getting that in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Morning headache? You can also try over-the-counter medications that contain a bit of &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, says Jennifer Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Laboratory at the University of Buffalo. If you’re using soda to address a chronic medical issue, such as &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/21/why-does-my-head-hurt/85661258007/?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=deeperdive&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good idea to consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/05/28/is-green-tea-good-for-you-health-benefits-every-day/70244800007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tea is a good option&lt;/a&gt; for a later-in-the-day &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt; as it generally contains less caffeine than coffee. And if you can’t stand the taste of coffee or tea, remember there are many varieties and flavors to try – and either of these beverages with a bit of natural sweetener or &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/01/is-milk-good-for-you/82639148007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; is going to be better for you than soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/25/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/70823544007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says to try seltzer or non-sweetened &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/26/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/86335041007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; "in the periods you would be going for a soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love soda for the taste, Temple suggests making “spa water” flavored with lemon, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/08/are-cucumbers-good-for-you/83973776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/17/what-is-ginger-beneficial-for/84468526007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, mint, basil or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/22/are-mandarin-oranges-good-for-you/85670307007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fresh ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Electrolyte powders, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/25/is-apple-juice-good-for-you/85253328007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt; and kombucha also substitute sweetness and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/04/12/can-dehydration-cause-high-blood-pressure/11634018002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;quench thirst&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful of sneaky high sodium amounts or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/13/is-erythritol-safe/71485440007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;When soda is your best bet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Soda is OK to use as an alcohol replacement because most people usually only drink alcohol at certain times or in certain settings anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If it’s an occasional thing, there is flexibility,” Gearhardt says. Like we do with alcohol, set up “no soda zones,” such as your work area to reduce the number of hours and places you could potentially drink a soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you want to swap out soda at your next happy hour, check out &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/11/what-is-a-mocktail/84044261007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, zero-proof &lt;a href="/story/money/2025/09/25/beer-companies-health-concerns-alcohol/86299088007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/03/can-alcohol-cause-cancer-surgeon-general/77430536007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; or alcohol-free liquors, Temple says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If you can't quit soda...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When in doubt, Gearhardt says use your common sense: What is the lowest-sugar option you have at any place and time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And when stopping soda has you feeling down, Gearhardt says to remember this is about prioritizing wellbeing. It’s not “quitting,” she says, it’s “getting healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’re not ready to ditch soda altogether, that’s OK. Eliminating just one soda per day can make a major health impact, Temple says: “View it more like a treat than a daily habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQeEZ4cXZkUWVrU0czaXJEb252ZDFBM004UmdKVW1xYzl1bnp3dm5HTzZSd1BCVkIwelpPM3ZTQnM5NDNMSk82bzdZbi1nRF84UUhjZHFkcmtjbXViTVNsTzlSZ1A1Z3pBVmZUU1R0d0xSbXJNNldPU3RGQ0g1ekladl9LY2tSR2pneVR5NE5lNXdPOVc3Yks2ZDZFNkQ1dXBFazBibXdxSmg</guid></item><item><title>50岁以上的女性应该优先考虑长寿的5种补充剂- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-women-over-50-11860488</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As women get older, nutrient needs can change based on menopause, losing muscle and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D, creatine and magnesium are a few of the recommended supplements for women. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle factors and diet make a big difference, like strength training, eating plants and sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turning 50 is an exciting milestone. But it’s also a time when women start to notice physical changes in their body, whether it’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-to-ease-menopause-symptoms-11837072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms related to menopause&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-in-menopause-11723891" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;natural loss of muscle&lt;/a&gt; that comes with age. The good news is that although you can’t control getting older, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blue-zones-healthy-habits-11791571" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;focusing on lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-changes-to-make-at-50-11757224" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;eating a nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, exercising, getting enough sleep and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt; can help minimize the negative side effects of age-related physical changes and help you live longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements may help too, according to emerging research. We asked experts which supplements women over 50 should consider taking. Here are the top five supplements they recommend and why. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin D is essential for bone strength, mood balance and immune health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN, CDN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;. It’s found in fatty fish and fortified milks and cereals, but it can be hard to get enough through food. Plus, you can only make it from sun exposure from late spring to early fall, says &lt;a href="https://lifestylemedicine.stanford.edu/lifestyle-team/bio-pojednic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Rachele Pojednic, Ph.D., Ed.M.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is vitamin D important over the age of 50? As women age, they lose bone mass. “Once women enter their 40s, bone loss starts to happen faster than we can create new bone,” says &lt;a href="https://jordanlanghough.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jordan Langhough, RD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. During perimenopause and menopause, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-keep-your-bones-strong-after-menopause-with-nutrition-11841357" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone loss accelerates&lt;/a&gt; even more due to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-you-gain-weight-during-menopause-11846767" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;declining estrogen levels&lt;/a&gt; and reduced calcium absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Vitamin D is needed to help absorb calcium and keep bones strong as we age,” says Langhough.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just for bones, says Pojednic. “Low vitamin D status in older women is also linked to weaker muscle function, greater risk of falls and sarcopenia,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In a systematic review conducted by Pojednic and her colleagues, vitamin D was shown to have beneficial effects on muscle strength and function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Ensuring sufficiency with supplementation is a sensible part of a muscle- and bone-focused healthy-aging strategy,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-creatine-bad-for-you-11806099" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creatine isn’t just for athletes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the best-kept secrets for healthy aging and women who want to stay active, independent and strong well into later life, says Berger. “Creatine supports energy production in muscle cells, helping preserve strength, bone health and even mental clarity,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Women lose 3% to 5% of muscle every decade, starting at the age of 30,” says Pojednic. While strength training is most important to combat this loss, creatine can also help. “Supplementing with about 3 to 5 grams per day of creatine monohydrate in conjunction with resistance training has been shown to help preserve muscle, improve strength and support bone-health outcomes,” says Pojednic.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even more, research shows that creatine can enhance the benefits of resistance training and reduce fatigue after workouts, says Berger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s also exciting research emerging around &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brain-benefits-of-creatine-11838817" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine and brain health&lt;/a&gt;. “Often known for its benefits to muscle recovery, creatine acts as an energy buffer for brain cells and restocks ATP, which was shown to improve memory, cognitive functioning and attention span,” says &lt;a href="https://healthyjasmine.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jasmine Jafferali, M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt; One study found that women in perimenopause or menopause who took creatine hydrochloride for eight weeks had faster reaction times and less severe mood swings compared to a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Creatine monohydrate, the more widely available form, has similar positive effects on memory, attention and processing speed time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-11836271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium is having a moment&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason. “Along with playing a role in more than 300 chemical reactions in the body and helping regulate blood sugar levels, studies show that magnesium may be effective for managing stress and anxiety, as well as reducing brain fog,” says Jafferali. The average age of menopause in the United States is 52, so many women in their 50s may be struggling with these symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows an interesting correlation between magnesium and stress where stress can deplete magnesium, and low magnesium can increase susceptibility to stress—creating a vicious cycle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Things like stress, sugar, caffeine and other stimulants often deplete magnesium from the body and it is often hard to get it from foods,” says Jafferali. If you don’t eat lots of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, like nuts, seeds and seafood, you may want to consider a supplement.

Nicotinamide Riboside &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nicotinamide riboside helps replenish NAD+, a critical coenzyme that declines with age,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. NAD+ is a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin). “It’s essential for cellular energy production and DNA repair, both of which are vital for maintaining energy levels, supporting healthy aging and promoting overall cellular resilience,” says Manaker. But NAD+ isn’t bioavailable, so the best way to boost it is to take the precursor, nicotinamide riboside. “By supporting healthy NAD+ levels, nicotinamide riboside can help combat the effects of aging, such as increased cellular stress and inflammation, which are linked to reduced vitality and age-related health concerns,” says Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Berger recommends a balanced B-complex vitamin with active forms like methylfolate and methylcobalamin for better absorption. “It’s a simple way to boost daily vitality, especially for those taking medications or under chronic stress, which can further deplete these key nutrients,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements should be just that: supplemental to lifestyle changes. Here are the top habits to focus on for health and longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body Daily: &lt;/strong&gt;Being sedentary is linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But swapping sitting for steps could lower your risk of dying early from any condition. Studies show that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8039177/walking-once-per-week-health-benefits-new-research/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;optimal amount is around 7,000-8,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; per day, but even 2,600 steps per day provided health benefits compared to 2,000, in one study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The takeaway? Every step counts. And if you want to do something more vigorous, go for it. More-intense exercise may be even better for longevity, according to research.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift Weights: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training is associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/these-3-healthy-habits-could-help-you-live-to-100-8668458" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;living longer and better quality of life&lt;/a&gt; as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because lifting weights increases muscle mass and strength, which reduces the risk of sarcopenia and its consequences like fractures and falls. It also makes daily tasks like carrying groceries easier and can help with weight management. So how often do you have to do it? Just twice per week can offer these benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, one interesting study found that 90 minutes of strength training per week slowed biological aging by almost four years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Plant-Based Foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Consuming a mostly plant-based diet is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-foods-longevity-study-11687926" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;linked to living longer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that switching from a typical American diet to a plant-based diet around the age of 20 could add 10 years to a woman’s life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s never too late, to reduce your intake of meat and pick up more produce at the store. Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and plant-based proteins &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and are associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Zzz’s: &lt;/strong&gt;Too little sleep is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;linked with chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lack of sleep also impairs mood and concentration. On the flip side, women who get both enough sleep and high-quality sleep live longer. During sleep, the body repairs cells, suppresses inflammation and keeps your immune system healthy. So what’s the sweet spot? Aim for seven to nine hours per night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And try to stay consistent with what time you go to bed and wake up: this is referred to as sleep regularity, and one study found that it was more important than getting enough sleep for longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Chronic stress is linked to an increased risk of conditions like heart disease and depression. Stress also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/endurance-exercise-anti-aging-benefits-new-research-8363872" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;speeds up cellular aging&lt;/a&gt; and can shorten telomeres, which cap the end of chromosomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shorter telomeres are associated with a shorter lifespan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is that this can somewhat be mitigated by making healthy lifestyle changes, like strength training. But the most important thing you can do for stress is manage it through techniques like breathing, meditation or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;

There’s clearly a big need for some &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/could-this-toads-psychedelic-venom-be-the-next-big-thing-in-antidepressants-74122" target="_blank"&gt;new options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed showed similar short-term improvements in depressive symptoms, with early indications that repeated dosing might extend these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Kiranpreet Gill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinical nitrous oxide emerged as a candidate because early studies indicated rapid symptom change through mechanisms distinct from traditional antidepressants,” Gill told us. “We wanted to systematically assess the available evidence to determine whether these findings were reliable and clinically relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three trials they looked at, the team found just one treatment with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, inhaled at a 50 percent concentration, was enough to start significantly reducing depressive symptoms in as little as 2 hours. However, these benefits didn’t last long, so other dosing strategies were tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks as though multiple treatment sessions over several weeks will be needed for sustained benefits, but that’s still a very different prospect than taking daily &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antidepressants-all-you-need-to-know-from-serotonin-to-psychedelics-73941" target="_blank"&gt;antidepressant&lt;/a&gt; medications, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The studies we reviewed showed similar short-term improvements in depressive symptoms, with early indications that repeated dosing might extend these effects,” said Gill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38l9n1qB43g?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? We asked Gill to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evidence suggests that nitrous oxide affects the glutamate system in the brain, which is important for how mood-related circuits function. By briefly blocking specific receptors in this system, it appears to help rebalance activity in areas involved in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/mood-patches-can-a-sticker-really-make-you-feel-better-77623" target="_blank"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; and emotional processing. These changes may help explain why some people experience improvement in depressive symptoms shortly after treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds promising, but it’s still very early days. The meta-analysis was limited by the small number of existing studies, and differences in how the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also safety aspects to consider. When used &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/man-hospitalized-with-spinal-cord-problems-from-nitrous-oxide-abuse-62271" target="_blank"&gt;recreationally&lt;/a&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has been associated with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/nitrous-oxide-is-no-laughing-matter-overuse-can-cause-permanent-neurological-damage-70329" target="_blank"&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt;, but it has been safely used in clinical settings for well over 100 years – as you’ll know, if you’ve ever had “gas and air” at the dentist or in hospital. Its use in patients with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/there-are-6-kinds-of-depression-that-can-be-identified-with-brain-scans-74690" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; would be similarly well-controlled, but that doesn’t mean there are no potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research will be needed to fully understand the risks, but current data are encouraging, with none of the existing studies reporting short-term safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant milestone in understanding the potential of nitrous oxide as an added treatment option for patients with depression who have been failed by current treatments,” said senior author Professor Steven Marwaha in a &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/clinical-use-of-nitrous-oxide-could-help-treat-depression-major-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This population has often lost hope of recovery, making the results of this study particularly exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill shared this optimism. “[T]hese findings suggest that nitrous oxide, when delivered clinically in controlled settings, warrants further evaluation for people who have not responded to standard treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our focus now is on building the evidence needed to understand how it could fit within clinical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/EBIOM/article/PIIS2352-3964(25)00467-0/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:57:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxQZjVRZmVFV3BUWWwtRjI0bjlsRVUyaTdkSEM5T205SmhvR0k1dVl2Q2dCMm9WZnFjYnpiUGYyd2J2U29LZzJlZlFfSnh3SHJWVllHdGpfRGxNWU5JWFBUcUs2TnpCRGtXWHB3eUhoa1pkb3NYNWFWVlotZEtTQ1phSEc5ZGJiM1BIUTV2RlRmVld0UUNPdmFfU2wzbjJDT3h3S3ZHRGlwOF9leVcyS2I0TmJvNzJsWXlxZ3h3ZWh1SkRmTkVwQmF2SGhUMA</guid></item><item><title>男性在31岁时被诊断出患有这6种症状的结肠癌；胃肠病学家解释了为什么你永远不应该忽视它们-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/man-gets-diagnosed-with-colon-cancer-at-31-with-these-6-symptoms-gastroenterologist-explains-why-you-should-never-ignore-them/photostory/125740223.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night sweats can soak one's sheets and pajamas completely. They wake you up drenched without hot weather, or infections present. Dr Joseph says that these occur due to Cancer cells that release chemicals that mess with body temperature. This causes chills and fever-like sweats at night. Tumors grow and inflame nearby tissues as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% of advanced colon cancer patients report drenching sweats. Early stages show it too, when people ignore the pattern. They blame spicy food, stress, or menopause instead. Night sweats signal the body fights inflammation from the tumor. This happens especially when combined with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track the patterns of sweats closely. Note if they pair with weight loss, or bowel changes. This calls for urgent medical checks right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>患有危及生命疾病的女性得知怀孕对她来说可能是致命的，所以她在男朋友无论如何都会推孩子之后结束了她3年的关系- TwistedSifter</title><link>https://twistedsifter.com/2025/12/woman-with-life-threatening-condition-learns-pregnancy-could-kill-her-so-she-ends-her-3-year-relationship-after-boyfriend-pushes-for-kids-anyway/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 29-year-old woman says she made the heartbreaking decision to end things with her boyfriend after he insisted they should still have children, even though pregnancy could kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his claims that having a baby would be a “beautiful legacy,” she couldn’t bring herself to risk her life or pass down her condition, leaving her torn between love and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1onsq3p/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend because I don’t want children anymore?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (29f) have been dating my boyfriend (33m) for 3 years. I have a medical condition that impacts my life expectancy and will likely kill me if I have children. From what I understand, I most likely won’t live beyond my 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always dreamed of being a mother so this diagnosis was heart-breaking, and as I enter my 30’s my anxiety over my condition and my health has gone up exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like I’ve just begun my life, and now a countdown to my death is always in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How terribly awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this is where the argument began. My boyfriend still wants children. He said he loves me and always envisioned me as the mother of his children. He said he loves me and wants a little piece of me even when I’m gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In not so many words he said since I’ve always wanted children and will likely die early anyway, why not make sure a piece of me lives on with him, ensure our legacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moment I was stunned, and when I’m shocked I find it hard to formulate my words. All I could respond was, “But they (the child) would have to live knowing I died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued that sacrifice was beautiful and it was wrong to blame children for a mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree I was an a****** for saying that, I didn’t mean it, but it slipped out. But if I had children, I would want to be a part of their life, not some human incubator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m focusing on preserving as much quality of life that I can while managing my health. I don’t want to risk passing this down to my child, and there’s a not insignificant possibility that both the baby and I would pass during the pregnancy regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend, and I could see him nearly come to tears over this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was shocked that I’d break up with him over something we had previously agreed on. He couldn’t believe I’d break up with him over a single disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it selfish of me to prioritize myself over my boyfriend and potential child? AITA for breaking up with him over this and not trying to work things out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit overwhelmingly supported her choice, saying she wasn’t selfish but brave for prioritizing her health and agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenters called the boyfriend’s stance manipulative and insensitive, arguing that love shouldn’t come with a demand that puts her life at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has been &lt;a href="/podcasts/462402/rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-advisory-committee-immunization-practices"&gt;casting doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines in the months leading up to virus season. Even though his department did approve a new flu vaccine for this year, his advisers also &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-committee-to-vote-on-flu-shots-and-preservative-thimerosal"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; removing certain ingredients from flu shots, even though those materials are not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The federal government is not going to be a reliable ally during this year’s cold and flu season, having already taken steps to undermine trust in both the Covid and flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You can protect yourself this winter — but you’ll have to do it yourself, in cooperation with the people close to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Think about your own risk and how much risk you’re willing to tolerate, communicate clearly with friends and family about your approach, and keep a close eye on your local situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have also &lt;a href="/health/460528/vaccine-recommendations-rfk-hhs-new-guidance-covid"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; any specific recommendations for the Covid vaccinations and, instead, told people to depend on “individual decision making.” On the cusp of flu activity picking up in the US, a top Food and Drug Administration official is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine process should be overhauled because it is not sufficient, while making unsubstantiated claims that the Covid shots have killed a small number of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And now, the forecast for the next few months is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not only is there disarray among public health authorities, but this year’s cold and flu season is looking to be especially bad. That is partly bad luck; developing a new flu shot every year is always a guessing game, and this year’s shot is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;not very well matched&lt;/a&gt; to the most widespread flu strains. But, it’s also partly a matter of choice, a consequence of the anti-public health mania Kennedy has helped stoke. The number of flu vaccinations administered between August and October &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90CEPo7LTAmN5x15eEfmmRynhCyV3GbnUtBeq6U-L1vRIAoTXov57Ts4wY6WY3-o8GR_b8kMfz2v5_S2NxAyVjKgsTDQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=390652300&amp;amp;utm_content=390652300&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;was the lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the past six years. The number of Covid boosters available to the public has been steadily dropping with each new shot, and now, Kennedy Jr.’s health department has decided to limit access. Less than 15 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html#:~:text=21%2C%202025-,About,with%20a%20health%20care%20provider."&gt;have received&lt;/a&gt; a Covid booster this year, including less than 1 in 3 seniors over 65. New RSV vaccines for infants &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/study-finds-low-varied-rsv-monoclonal-and-maternal-vaccination#:~:text=State%20variations%2C%20timing%20tracking,improvements%20as%20the%20season%20progressed."&gt;have had discouragingly low uptake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This winter, more than ever, we are all on our own in combating flu, cold, RSV, and Covid-19. The federal government is no longer a reliable ally, because it has shown, with Kennedy leading the charge, that it will &lt;a href="/health/459768/trump-cdc-director-monarez-robert-kennedy-jr"&gt;routinely ignore established science&lt;/a&gt;. The medical community is scrambling to fill the void, but the fundamental challenge is that many people, not only within Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement but across the political spectrum, no longer trust the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new reality, not everyone will be on the same page. Some people may choose to take no precautions at all, even as cases rise. But, you do have agency to protect your personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="public-health-is-out-for-now-were-in-a-new-era-of-diy-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Public” health is out for now. We’re in a new era of DIY health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a long time, public health was embraced by the public. It had stacked up wins over the decades: eradicating polio and smallpox in the 20th century and measles at the turn of the 21st. Diseases that had killed millions over millennia were relegated to the past as better sanitation, vaccinations, and greater awareness — the bedrock of the public health playbook — became woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As recently as a decade ago, the people who opposed vaccinations and other public health interventions remained well outside of the mainstream. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself was, before the start of the Covid pandemic, a marginal figure who spewed conspiracy theories about vaccines and autism. Even Trump kept his distance from Kennedy during his first term, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-trump-rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-book-2025-10"&gt;reportedly at the urging of Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, despite his own past flirtations with anti-vaccine rhetoric. And while Kennedy’s influence and the work of other anti-vaccine activists may have chipped away at the public’s belief in vaccinations, they had limited success. Most Americans still thought getting their annual shots was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, we live in a different reality now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two decades ago, 94 percent of Americans believed it was extremely or very important to get children vaccinated — near unanimity, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2025, just 69 percent still agree. In &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/quick-take/challenges-for-rebuilding-trust-in-the-cdc/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20CDC%20director%20Susan,trust%20among%20partisans%20going%20forward."&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, 85 percent of Americans trusted the CDC to provide reliable information about vaccines, per KFF polling. By &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;October 2025&lt;/a&gt;, that share had fallen to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the worst measles outbreak in years &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;took hold&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas earlier this year, local health officials were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/"&gt;losing their federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and getting limited support at best from the CDC while Kennedy waffled on the value of vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; unproven treatments such as cod liver oil. As Milwaukee contended with a lead poisoning crisis in its school buildings, its residents had no one in Washington to call, because the relevant team &lt;a href="/public-health/413352/donald-trump-rfk-milwaukee-schools-lead-poisoning"&gt;had been fired&lt;/a&gt;. Whooping cough is back and worse than it’s been in years as vaccination rates fall. Kennedy has been mum on the issue, despite &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5501601-cassidy-kennedy-whooping-cough-louisiana/"&gt;pleas&lt;/a&gt; from Republican senators to weigh in publicly and affirm the value of the whooping cough vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re a deeply divided country, specifically on the subject of &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health. And that means a lot of your neighbors aren’t going to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="heres-how-you-can-navigate-this-sickness-season-in-these-unusual-times" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Here’s how you can navigate this sickness season in these unusual times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are concerned about your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; health, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Let’s start by talking about risk. Much of the backlash to the various pandemic interventions — things like masking and issuing vaccine mandates — was founded in different people’s differing risk assessments and risk tolerance. You would hear it all the time from the opponents of those measures: Why should a young man with no serious health problems be &lt;em&gt;required &lt;/em&gt;to get a shot? Many people today find the traditional public health argument — because he might unwittingly pass it along to another person who is more vulnerable — unpersuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, to be fair, it is true that certain people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a much higher risk of Covid, or flu, or RSV than others do — and their choices and behaviors during what most of us call the cold and flu season can reasonably differ. No two people are exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That is simply the reality we are living in: individual health, not public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, your seasonal strategy should start with assessing your own risk. If you are 25 years old with no children and minimal exposure to the elderly, you may decide it’s reasonable to take chances on, for example, going out in public when flu activity is high in your area. If you’re a 65-year-old with a chronic health condition or a compromised immune system, you might not be willing to take the same risks; at least, you might want to think about wearing a mask if there are a lot of Covid or RSV cases in your community. If you are, like me, the 38-year-old parent of three, you might fall somewhere in between the two poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Think about your own situation and the people you come into contact with every day and use that as a guide by which you can evaluate your risk and make decisions. Get on the same page with the people in your life you see regularly: your family, friends and coworkers. You don’t have to completely agree on your risk tolerance to be open and transparent about your mindset as we head into the season. If there are certain dealbreakers — like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t want you to come to my house if you have a runny nose or fever&lt;/em&gt; — talk about how you’ll handle those situations in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;From that baseline, you need reliable information as the winter goes on and viral activity starts to pick up. Start local. Most people &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they have much more trust in their personal doctor than they do in major medical organizations, including the CDC. If you have a primary care doctor, or you can find one, they will be a reliable source whom you can speak to face to face or over a telehealth call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t have a primary physician, or you simply want to educate yourself on what leading medical authorities are saying, you can check out the recommended vaccinations for children under 18 from &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Different state groups — one on &lt;a href="https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le-1157350.pdf"&gt;the West Coast&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; — are issuing their own vaccine recommendations for adults. The West Coast Health Alliance, for example, advises all adults over 65 to get a Covid shot, people under 65 with certain risk factors, and all adults who are in contact with high-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your insurance coverage could be different this year, too, after the changes to vaccine guidance made by the Trump administration. Kennedy’s health department has scaled back the official government vaccine guidance to “individual decision making” — once again, you’re on your own — and that could affect some insurers’ willingness to cover the cost of a Covid shot. You could call your health plan in advance to find out if it will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And otherwise, keep an eye on what’s happening in your community. State governments often publish infectious disease dashboards with up-to-date data, and local health departments usually send out advisories when local case loads are high.

That’s what comes through immediately in this video from @beaunosebones, where Beau, the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, has quietly made himself part of his brother Frankie’s recovery routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip opens with Frankie on the couch wearing a nebulizer mask, and before you even register the machine, the camera drops down to show Beau planted right in front of him. He’s not pacing, not whining — just sitting there like this is his assigned post and he fully intends to clock in until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Viral video shows Golden Retriever staying by sick brother’s side&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The whole video is therapy, not just for Frankie, but for the rest of us watching, too. Part of the reason the clip has climbed past 249k likes. In the next shot, Frankie is still nebulizing, and Beau has moved just enough to rest his chin on the couch cushion. He looks at his little brother with eyes that look like they are checking every breath of his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beau has this solid, comforting presence that only a dog who has seen the baby grow up can bring. He doesn’t even have to move to make you feel safe. Next, the video switches to a tender scene. Frankie is resting on his dad’s lap while Beau is settled right underneath his dad’s feet. He’s tucked in so carefully it almost looks staged, but it’s clearly just him choosing the nearest spot to stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every cut that follows shows the same thing. Frankie is trying to heal, and Beau is adjusting to stay right there with him. Couch, floor, tucked against legs… the location changes, but his job doesn’t. He’s the best nurse for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comments read like a collective exhale from parents and dog lovers. Basically, anyone who’s been through long recovery days with a kid: “Beau is the best medicine for Frankie,” “That’s the sweetest big brother,” “Always right there.” The caption sums it up perfectly: “Beau just knows where he’s needed most.” He sure does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/198149-video-golden-retriever-sick-brother-wholesome-viral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever Doesn’t Leave Sick Brother’s Side in Wholesome Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever Doesn’t Leave Sick Brother’s Side in Wholesome Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:02:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNRGVBbnAxV044Vzdvc0dLQm96U1QxZkdYdGkzeGhMVGFoMmRxa1p2RWpnWFFEeFlJTUNBbU4xeHV3ZWdyaEphRVc5V1FZZkdSeGEzOXpVc1BaUDhjTjNyMXZudWpEdWRFWnFrcW5PMk5pNzBZV25sblpIZTFXVFZuOThyZ09OQ0pKZko1OWZJcw</guid></item><item><title>不安腿综合征与帕金森病风险有关，使其成为早期治疗的完美案例-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/restless-legs-syndrome-linked-to-parkinsons-risk-making-it-a-perfect-case-for-early-treatment/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean scientists recently determined that patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) showed approximately double the Parkinson’s disease incidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t sound like good news, it’s because you haven’t heard what they found next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Korea University Ansan Hospital and collaborators then found that among those RLS patients, those who were treated with a recently-developed dopamine agonist treatment experienced a protective buffer against Parkinson’s disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were gathered from a nationwide cohort of nearly 20,000 people, involved Ansan Hospital, Pohang Stroke and Spine Hospital, and National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, and were &lt;a href="https://medicine.korea.ac.kr/en/research/research/view.do?articleNo=55526" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in the journal JAMA Network Open on October 6th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sleep disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often worsening at night. Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is marked by tremor, rigidity, and slowed movement. Both conditions are associated with dysfunction in the brain’s dopaminergic system, but their causal relationship has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study, led by Professor Jong Hun Kim from the Department of Neurology, Ansan Hospital, analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort (2002–2019). The researchers identified 9,919 individuals with RLS and compared them with an equal number of matched controls without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a median follow-up of 15 years, Parkinson’s developed in 1.6% of RLS patients compared with 1.0% of controls, confirming a heightened risk. When analyzed by treatment status, the results revealed a striking divergence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with untreated RLS showed the highest Parkinson’s incidence (2.1%) and an earlier onset of the disease, whereas patients given a dopamine agonist treatment showed a markedly lower Parkinson’s incidence (0.5%) and a delayed onset compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings indicate the existence of ‘heterogeneity within RLS’ which allows for multiple interpretations,” Professor Kim explained. “One of the interpretations is that restless legs syndrome may serve as an early clinical marker for Parkinson’s disease, particularly among untreated individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREAN STORIES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results also indicate that dopamine therapy, used for symptom control, may confer protective benefits to the brain’s motor pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the validity of their conclusions, the team employed target-trial emulation methods, an advanced analytical approach that reduces bias in observational research. This methodological rigor reinforces the biological plausibility of a link between RLS and PD rather than a mere overlap in symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKINSON’S &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that beyond dopamine dysfunction, other factors—such as sleep disruption, iron deficiency, and immune or metabolic pathways—may mediate this association. The protective trend observed with dopamine therapy could reflect neuroprotective mechanisms or improved identification of genuine RLS cases that are distinct from early-stage Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This dual pattern underscores the importance of recognizing and managing restless legs syndrome early,” adds Professor Kim. “Monitoring and treating RLS may not only improve sleep quality but could also influence long-term neurological health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE This Story With Anyone You Know With RLS, It Could Save Their Brains…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Probably later than you think. According to &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to brain functionality, adulthood starts at 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The findings show that the human brain has five phases throughout a lifespan, and researchers say they are all broken up by age — 9, 32, 66 and 83, on average. Researchers referred to these ages as “turning points” when the brain rewires and goes through age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The childhood brain, a time of high growth, lasts through roughly age 9, when it then changes to the adolescent brain, which continues until 32. Yes, 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that someone who is in the later part of this adolescent brain phase is going to act like a teenager, Dr. Alexa Mousley, the study leader, told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Guardian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it means their brains simply resemble each other as they continue to grow and form until the adult brain phase is reached. This adolescent brain phase is the only time when brain efficiency is consistently increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study authors said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;study authors said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age 32 also marks the “strongest shift” of all of the brain changes. Around this time, the brain goes into its adult era ― the longest phase ― which lasts until roughly age 66. During the adult era, or adult “epoch” as researchers call these phases, there is a “plateau in intelligence and personality,” the study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="press release states" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;press release states&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning, brain function stays pretty much the same for these decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 66, the brain changes, and it moves into the “early aging” phase, which does not have dramatic changes, but the brain does show “further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate,” Mousley said in a press release. This aligns with the physical health issues that often start to appear in the 60s, Mousley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension,” Mousley said in the statement. Hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) can put you at higher risk of stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final epoch starts at 83 and is known as “late aging,” which is a time when brain connectivity reduces and there is more reliance on specific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, researchers looked at a number of factors, including brain compartmentalization, along with the changes and deterioration of the nerve fibers in the brains of 3,802 people ages 0 to 90 via data from MRI scans. All participants were described as “neurotypical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have limitations. The late-aging group of people was smaller than the other groups. More, participants in all groups had to meet certain health criteria, which may make them healthier than the general public. This could mean that study participants’ brain functionality may be more optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The brain does not reach adulthood until about age 32, according to a new study.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain changes are inevitable as you age, but there are things you can do to keep your brain healthy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain health is a major concern for people as they grow older, especially with more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; having a dementia diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Forgetting things here and there" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Forgetting things here and there&lt;/a&gt; is no major cause for concern as you get older, but if those memory issues disrupt your life, you should talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to help keep your brain as optimal as possible throughout your lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy habits, overall, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can help reduce dementia risk factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;can help reduce dementia risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows norovirus cases have doubled over the past few weeks, with positive tests surging from seven percent in August to 14 percent in mid-November. The spike has arrived earlier than anticipated and during a surge in other respiratory illnesses, including COVID, whooping cough, and seasonal flu. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, leading to severe vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain, the CDC warns. About 20 million people contract the disease each year, and while most victims recover in one to three days, the illness can lead to severe infections amongst children and older adults. There is no cure for norovirus, but health officials recommend stopping its spread by washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, and properly washing vegetables and shellfish before eating them. Those with the disease are advised to rest, drink electrolyte-containing fluids, and eat bland foods. The highest recorded month for Norovirus cases was December 2024, when 25 percent of tests for the disease came back positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="read-it-at-btn" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/03/norovirus-winter-vomiting-disease-bug-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Read it at &lt;span&gt;Axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPQnM4ZHQ3RmxtZmZwN1AzTHJwX3g0UlVzQnFUM3Rhc25PRmpkdEMyMVRUOWk0MVAtdTZuLWJIMlE4aXBkVEhCY3JUNS1rMmJtOVM3NEgwNGR5TGJyUzBwNzdjRUs0dHF4SlRJSUpZQ0MzQmlIc2wzTENnRW1QV1QwZHlqRnhoLTlMOXRjZlJlVQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
