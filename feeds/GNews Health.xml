          &lt;p&gt;The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/"&gt;we have chips&lt;/a&gt; that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/scientists-built-an-ai-co-pilot-for-prosthetic-bionic-hands/"&gt;AI-based control software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Location via spikes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the recent work, based in China, decided to implement something similar for an artificial skin that could be used to cover a robotic hand. They limited sensing to pressure, but implemented other things the nervous system does, including figuring out the location of input and injuries, and using multiple layers of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this started out by making a flexible polymer skin with embedded pressure sensors that were linked up to the rest of the system via conductive polymers. The next layer of the system converted the inputs from the pressure sensors to a series of activity spikes—short pulses of electrical current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways that these trains of spikes can convey information: the shape of an individual pulse, through their magnitude, through the length of the spike, and through the frequency of the spikes. Spike frequency is the most commonly used means of conveying information in biological systems, and the researchers use that to convey the pressure experienced by a sensor. The remaining forms of information are used to create something akin to a bar code that helps identify which sensor the reading came from.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the most widely known metric," Dr. Erica Spatz, a cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the new study, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt; She noted that BMI alone does not account for adipose tissue, which stores energy, insulates organs and produces hormones that regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Spatz said adipose tissue is less visible than other types of fat but "is more associated with high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the study, published in JAMA Network Open, the team used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national survey run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that measures the health and nutrition of adults and children in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team looked at data from more than 14,000 participants representing 237.7 million adults between 2017 and 2023, applying the Lancet Commission's proposed obesity criteria along with BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They found an estimated 75.2% of U.S. adults met criteria for obesity using BMI and additional body measurements compared to 40% when BMI alone was reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study, told ABC News that the findings provide a sense of how significant obesity is in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We do have a major problem. Obesity is by far the most significant chronic disease in human history," she said. "And this Lancet Commission really gives us a sense of how significant it is and how much we need to be doing a better job of treating it, make sure that we have the clinicians that are trained to identify not only obesity itself, but the over 230 chronic diseases associated with it and making sure that we have a healthier society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nearly four in 10 adults with a "normal" BMI were found to have excess body fat when waist-based measures were also applied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also found that obesity prevalence increased sharply with age and was higher among Hispanic adults though rates were similar between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted that the study has limitations. And because nearly all adults age 50 and older were classified as having obesity under the new definition, age-specific thresholds are needed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors did highlight the limitations of BMI as a standalone screening tool and suggest that incorporating waist measurements could improve obesity detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They also stressed that because the new criteria will likely raise the current obesity estimates, more research should be done before broadly adopting the new definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ABC News' Dr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Veronica Danquah &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Crystal Richards, MD, MS is a p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ediatric resident doctor at New-York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia University Medical Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:29:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNbnp5bGItSlZ6Tl9admdlMFljbmE1QUQ2UXdQUzltVXNsa3ZJVkxINGctcG1FSjExdnFDOER1YmxZV3lNbGRGenlIbHMtRUVUN2s5cUt1cHQ1UE95WUw5Y0d6c2dhRjZDdVppZHhjVllOSmVqNUVPWUJRMEhnMWVxUDV1a1kwUFpQYVdTUWlzZVNGdFI5LV9qQkVtNzBvemfSAaQBQVVfeXFMTVFzRWtXYVZVNW9yR1FOVFlkZEY0TVRvbGh3d1BtcEh6eElrUnN4NW1FeXM2OGYzdzJLNWxubDdCb01XM2Etdjh2eElDdF9HSGVjYWVyaTNhUUgxU2pQT0YwV0VJRktZTGN6cGpFZWN4SEh2amJwVUtSQTFXbmlGQkNyYzVMQ0tXR2hZYlJ3OXZtS3JhZGwyNVRxcjFZWjg4Q3IwbV8</guid></item><item><title>一种致命的疯牛病在北美鹿群中蔓延- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/a-deadly-mad-cow-like-disease-is-spreading-among-north-american-deer-2000703926</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We’re not ending 2025 without a last bit of awful news: Wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about a dangerous brain illness spreading among deer in North America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last several weeks, officials in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Manitoba, Canada, have reported cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in new areas. The mad cow-like illness can spread easily between deer and has a 100% fatality rate. In addition to its ecological impact, the infection may also pose a potential health threat to humans, particularly hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The zombie protein&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prions are perhaps the strangest pathogen around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re the misfolded form of a normally harmless protein found in the brain (also confusingly called the prion protein). When a rogue prion encounters its regular counterpart, it somehow forces the latter to misfold as well, almost like a zombie infection. Over time, this amassing army of bad prions will destroy the animal’s brain, leading to death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prion diseases have been found in many animals, humans included. The most infamous one might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-mad-cow-disease-history-prions-1851242160"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt;. Much like mad cow, deer and related cervids afflicted with CWD will experience neurological symptoms like confusion, trouble walking, and rapid weight loss (the titular wasting).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-wasting/animals/index.html"&gt;CWD&lt;/a&gt; was first discovered in the U.S. over 50 years ago, though it took longer for scientists to determine that prions are behind it. And it’s been spreading further across North America ever since. Cases have now been &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/distribution-chronic-wasting-disease-north-america-0"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in at least 36 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In mid-December, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission &lt;a href="https://www.agfc.com/news/cwd-positive-deer-found-in-grant-sevier-counties/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; three cases of CWD in hunter-harvested white-tailed deer. These cases were found in Grant and Sevier counties, where CWD had never previously been detected (the first ever case in Arkansas was reported in 2016). Last week, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/newsroom/release/116586"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its first positive CWD test result of a deer in La Crosse County. That same week, the Manitoba Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures &lt;a href="https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=72097&amp;amp;posted=2025-12-22"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; five new cases of CWD, two of which were in previously undetected areas (the first CWD case in Manitoba was documented in 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why CWD matters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The increasing presence of CWD in North America is concerning for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CWD can be transmitted relatively easily, compared to other prion diseases like mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common, but still rare, prion disease that affects humans. CWD can spread directly through contact with infected animals and bodily fluids like saliva, and might also spread through prions left behind in the environment by urine or feces. That means CWD has the potential to cause sustained outbreaks of illness in both free-ranging and captive deer populations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s also the scary, if still only theoretical, danger of transmission to humans. Mad cow has sparked outbreaks of CJD in humans, caused by people eating contaminated beef. The possibility exists that a similar event could happen with hunters who eat CWD-tainted meat. Last year, for instance, a team of researchers &lt;a class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://gizmodo.com/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-meat-prions-hunter-deaths-1851423216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://gizmodo.com/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-meat-prions-hunter-deaths-1851423216" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; in a case report that two hunters who died from CJD may have been infected after consuming CWD-infected deer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cases have not been conclusively tied to CWD, and other scientists have been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prions-venison-deer-meat-brain-disease-mad-cow-guide-1851547274"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; about the connection. Experimental studies have also provided mixed evidence for any transmission risk to people, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Still, CWD remains a real and growing threat to deer, as well as the human industries that rely on them. So even if CWD never directly harms us, it could cause a serious ecological disaster—large outbreaks could devastate local deer populations, which in turn would affect other species in the area, or cause the closure of deer farms, a $7.9 billion industry. To that end, Wisconsin officials have extended an existing baiting and feeding ban in La Crosse County (baits can attract large populations of deer to an area). Hunters, meanwhile, are advised against eating deer that are untested, or confirmed to have CWD.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular walking supports loss of visceral fat, a harmful type of fat linked to chronic disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether in the morning or evening, walking at any time of day can provide meaningful benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistency matters more than timing—choose a time you can stick with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all body fat is created equal. The fat hidden deep in your belly—known as visceral fat—is particularly important to understand. Unlike subcutaneous fat, the pinchable layer beneath your skin, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;visceral fat surrounds vital organs&lt;/a&gt; like the liver, stomach and intestines. Visceral fat is metabolically active, which means too much of it can pose serious risk to your health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of fat can affect hormone production, increase levels of inflammatory cytokines, fuel insulin imbalance and raise the risk of chronic diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.functionalnutritionofcharleston.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Tomlin, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These potential health impacts make reducing visceral fat a priority to protect your long-term health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise is one of the most effective ways to reduce visceral fat, and it doesn’t require high-intensity workouts. Walking, in particular, is one of the most accessible and effective tools at your disposal. “Regular walking improves insulin sensitivity, lowers stress hormones and supports fat metabolism, making it an effective and sustainable way to reduce visceral fat over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Mascha-Davis/162939049" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But as you lace up your sneakers, you might find yourself wondering: Does the time of day matter? Is a sunrise stroll more effective than a sunset stride? We spoke with experts to find out whether there’s truly a “best” time to walk for visceral fat loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-there-a-best-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Is There a Best Time? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you look at the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lose-body-fat-8619424" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;science of fat loss&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to get caught up in timing “hacks” or secret tricks that promise faster results. But for walking and overall health, experts say we may be overcomplicating things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The most important factor in any exercise routine is your ability to stick with it long-term. If you force yourself to wake up at 4 a.m. for a walk but hate every minute of it, you likely won’t last a month. Likewise, if you plan to walk after work but are always too exhausted, that plan fails too. Therefore, the “perfect” time is largely subjective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tomlin puts the debate to rest quite clearly: “In short, no, there is no ‘best’ time to walk to reduce visceral fat. Consistency is more important than timing.” The cumulative effect of daily movement—regardless of when it happens—is what ultimately shifts the needle on visceral fat. The goal is to build a habit that fits naturally into your lifestyle so that you never have to rely solely on willpower to get out the door. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, if you’re curious, there are some subtle differences between walking in the morning versus later in the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-walking-in-the-morning"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Benefits of Walking in the Morning &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While consistency is king, there are unique benefits to getting your steps in early. For many people, a morning walk &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-health-experts-do-in-the-morning-11693714" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sets a positive tone for the day&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring your workout is done before daily distractions derail good intentions. This sense of accomplishment, plus the natural mood-boosting benefits of exercise, can start your day off on the right track.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning walks can also support metabolic health by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-blood-sugar-11681853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt; and enhancing metabolic flexibility—your body’s ability to efficiently switch between burning carbs and fat. In particular, getting in a morning walk before a busy workday, especially if it involves sitting at a desk, reduces sedentary hours. Research shows that even 30 minutes of light activity instead of sitting can improve metabolic flexibility and may support visceral fat loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for whether you should do this before or after you eat, the answer isn’t as clear. Some people enjoy walking before breakfast, or “fasted cardio,” while others prefer eating first. Currently, research shows overall benefits are similar either way, so the best approach is one you’ll actually do consistently.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, one often-overlooked perk of morning walks is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-boost-energy-8425516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exposure to early sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. Morning light helps to regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality, explains &lt;a href="https://www.wisebitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Poor sleep is linked to increased visceral fat, so getting outside early can have meaningful effects on both sleep and overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-exercising-in-the-afternoon-or-evening"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Benefits of Exercising in the Afternoon (or Evening) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t a morning person, don’t worry—&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/afternoon-habit-women-after-50-for-healthy-aging-11830800" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking later in the day&lt;/a&gt; comes with its own powerful benefits, especially for how your body handles food. After we eat, our blood sugar levels naturally rise, and walking shortly after a meal can help blunt this spike by encouraging your muscles to use that glucose for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is particularly relevant after dinner, which is often the largest meal of the day. “Walking after meals, especially dinner, can be particularly helpful because it improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, which influence visceral fat storage,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moving your body when blood sugar is elevated helps prevent excess insulin secretion, which can signal the body to store fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking later in the day can also make the habit easier to stick with, especially for those who rush in the mornings. For many, exercise after work can serve as a decompression tool to transition from “work mode” to “relax mode.” Not only can this help lower stress, but it can set the tone for a more restful evening and better sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-getting-started"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Getting Started &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ready to tackle visceral fat with a daily walk? The key is to keep it simple and sustainable. Here are a few strategies to help you build a walking routine that lasts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Gradually&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are new to exercise, begin with just 10 to 15 minutes a day instead of jumping straight into an hourlong walk. This lets your muscles and joints adapt without causing soreness or injury. Gradually add a few minutes each week as your stamina improves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a Time That Works Best&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at your daily schedule and identify a window where you’re least likely to be interrupted or distracted. Whether it’s first thing in the morning, during your lunch break or after dinner, dedicating a specific time helps automate the habit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a Walking Buddy&lt;/strong&gt;. Pairing up with a friend, family member or neighbor can make the activity significantly more enjoyable and social. Having someone waiting for you creates a sense of accountability, making it much harder to skip your walk when you don’t feel like it. The conversation also makes the time pass quickly, turning exercise into a social outing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair It with Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re walking solo, try listening to your favorite podcast, audiobook or an energetic music playlist while you move. This technique, often called “temptation bundling,” pairs something you enjoy with a healthy habit you want to build. It can make the walk feel like a reward rather than a chore.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Your Progress&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider using a simple pedometer, a smartwatch or a journal to keep track of your daily steps or time spent walking. Seeing your numbers increase over time provides a tangible sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep going. It also helps you spot patterns in your routine so you can adjust as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit a Health Care Professional.&lt;/strong&gt; Before starting a new exercise routine, it’s important to run it by your health care provider, especially if you have any underlying conditions. They can also help design a walking plan that works best for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, winning the battle against visceral fat isn’t about stressing over the “perfect” time to walk. It’s about moving your body consistently and taking a holistic approach to your health. Whether you love the quiet calm of a morning stroll or the stress-busting benefits of an evening walk, the best time is simply the time you will actually do it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that walking is just one piece of the puzzle. “Sleep, stress and nutrition all influence visceral fat, so walking works best as part of a bigger routine,” says Shah. By combining daily movement with adequate rest and a balanced diet, you create the best environment for your body to thrive.

&lt;p id="6bf0b261-17ac-453f-93ce-6876648cc97b"&gt;A vaccine that blocks the effects of fentanyl — including overdose — will enter human trials in the coming months, perhaps leading the way to the first-ever proactive treatment for opioid use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial trials will focus on assessing the safety of the vaccine, which was initially developed with funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. The shot was previously tested in rats and showed promising results. Now, it's been licensed by startup ARMR Sciences, which will begin enrolling patients for Phase I clinical trials in the Netherlands in 2026, starting in either January or February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6bf0b261-17ac-453f-93ce-6876648cc97b-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;"Our goal as a company is to eliminate the lethality of the drug supply," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armrsciences.com/team/collin-gage/" target="_blank" data-url="https://armrsciences.com/team/collin-gage/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colin Gage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and CEO of ARMR.

Opioids, also called narcotics, broadly work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, triggering changes in nerve cell signaling that prevent pain and can create a euphoric high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these opioid receptors are also found in the part of the brain that controls breathing, so fentanyl can also reduce respiration to a deadly degree if used in excess. A 2-milligram dose of fentanyl — similar in volume to about a dozen grains of salt — can be fatal, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Drug Enforcement Agency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DEA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person overdosing on fentanyl is treated with naloxone (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/fda-approves-over-the-counter-narcan-to-combat-opioid-overdose-crisis" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/fda-approves-over-the-counter-narcan-to-combat-opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;&lt;u&gt;better known by the brand name Narcan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), quickly enough, these effects can be reversed. This antidote also binds to opioid receptors, thus blocking the effects of fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2S6keBAPTRuTtqvftSmoCc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2S6keBAPTRuTtqvftSmoCc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARMR's vaccine takes a different approach: It works in the circulatory system, before the drug can reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would be the first-ever treatment that does not work on the [opioid] receptor," Gage told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-05ef4b73-05f2-4f48-ab7f-5e81df80f844" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-s-in-the-vaccine-3"&gt;What's in the vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9978d089-b76f-45d1-afb5-5c3c21e8ada5"&gt;To keep fentanyl from reaching the brain, the immune system must first recognize the drug. But fentanyl is a tiny molecule, not a pathogen like a virus, and immune cells don't naturally react to its presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To spur an immune response to fentanyl, the University of Houston's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armrsciences.com/team/dr-colin-haile/" target="_blank" data-url="https://armrsciences.com/team/dr-colin-haile/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colin Haile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ARMR co-founder and scientific adviser, and his colleagues had to tie the opioid to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They chose a deactivated diphtheria toxin called CRM197, a compound already used in vaccines on the market; once deactivated, the toxin is no longer toxic and instead helps rouse an immune response. To boost this immune response even further, they also added dmLT, a compound distilled from toxins produced by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;bacterium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This modified compound is not toxic itself, and it has also been tested in humans in trials of other, not-yet-approved, vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two components are attached to a synthetic piece of the fentanyl molecule, which in and of itself cannot cause a high or pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the immune system meets this combo of fentanyl fragments, CRM197 and dmLT, it builds &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that react to real fentanyl. These antibodies bind to the opioid, keeping it from crossing the brain's protective membrane — the blood-brain barrier — and then clearing it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9694531/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9694531/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rat studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine blocked fentanyl from entering the rodents' brain and also blocked the drug from depressing respiration and causing overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ac61c6c6-a4d0-4994-a67a-662f6f8a9372" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-is-the-vaccine-being-tested-3"&gt;How is the vaccine being tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="15dce4e7-ce26-4188-8751-9a4f43638248"&gt;So far, the studies on the vaccine have been in rodents, though dmLT and CRM197 have respectively been tested to some extent and are already used in other vaccines in humans. The protocol in rats is to give an initial dose of the fentanyl vaccine and then boosters three and six weeks out from the first dose, Haile told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The longest we've followed the animals in our studies is about six months and we saw complete blockade of fentanyl effects at six months post the initial vaccination," Haile said. It remains to be seen how that will translate to "human years," he noted, but lab rats live a couple of years in total, so the researchers think the vaccine will work for a long time in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial human trials that will begin in early 2026 will enroll 40 people and will focus on detecting any safety issues with the vaccines, such as unwanted or dangerous side effects. Researchers will also draw blood samples from participants to make sure that the vaccine is spurring the creation of anti-fentanyl antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these Phase I trials are successful, the next step will be Phase II trials to test the vaccine's efficacy — how well the vaccine blocks fentanyl's effects. In these trials, not only will antibody levels be tracked over time, but some participants will also be dosed with safe levels of fentanyl used for pain relief in medical procedures. This will be done under close supervision, to check that the vaccine works in the presence of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="50b12702-95dd-483f-9583-6adcee5c5414"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The new vaccine is designed to block the effects of fentanyl, including overdose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-10add81a-802c-4f26-8f8d-4bedad5b3433" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-potential-drawbacks-to-the-vaccine-3"&gt;Are there potential drawbacks to the vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="fe2fd0c8-59c0-4c19-bfe2-1a95a140d62d"&gt;Fentanyl has legitimate medical uses as a painkiller, especially in emergency situations. One concern about the vaccine is that people who take it will lose this option for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the antibodies created by vaccination do not bind to other opioids — such as morphine, oxycodone or methadone — or to other pain-relief options, Haile said. That means there are alternatives if people who get the vaccine need pain relief down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug also does not interfere with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/buprenorphine" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/buprenorphine" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buprenorphine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a drug used to treat opioid use disorder by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Haile said he and his team are currently testing the vaccine in combination with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/naltrexone" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/naltrexone" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naltrexone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a non-opioid medication also used to block the effects of opioids in treatment of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, it might be possible to take enough fentanyl to override the body's supply of anti-fentanyl antibodies, Haile said. However, given that the vaccine blocks fentanyl's euphoric effects, he expects people who want to quit will not be motivated to try to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want people who want to quit, want to not use the drug," he said. "That will give them a chance to realize that they won’t get high from this drug and there is no use in taking it any longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-fe6ea8e1-3a66-4019-841c-4fdba71ce53a" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-might-benefit-from-the-fentanyl-vaccine-3"&gt;Who might benefit from the fentanyl vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="bfff0d10-f94f-47ed-824a-dc7a77a1f7c2"&gt;Gage suggested that one market for the vaccine could be first responders concerned about accidental fentanyl exposure. (That &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395921002061" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395921002061" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;concern has risen in recent years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492952/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492952/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with the spread of misinformation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about fentanyl.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clarity: if fentanyl gets on your skin via casual exposure — for example, if you touch an object that's been exposed to the drug — it will not absorb through the skin. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/opioids/fentanyl-exposure-public-places" target="_blank" data-url="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/opioids/fentanyl-exposure-public-places" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meaningful absorption through the skin requires direct contact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the drug over hours or days. That said, if an EMT or police officer gets the drug on their hands and then touches their mouth or eyes, they could feel some of the drug's analgesic, or pain-relieving, effects, Haile said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine could also be "an extra tool in the toolset" for people with opioid use disorder, Gage said. Combining the vaccine with "robust" &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of talk therapy, and communal support could be "incredibly beneficial to people who are just looking for another lifeline to help themselves get better," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="0db7a398-1817-4469-b3a9-733e9f02a58b"&gt;Finally, the vaccine could be beneficial for people who use less-deadly drugs — such as cocaine, stimulants or painkillers — that they buy on the black market. That's because these drugs &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/fentanyl-overdose-death-rates-more-than-tripled-in-recent-years-cdc-report-shows" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/fentanyl-overdose-death-rates-more-than-tripled-in-recent-years-cdc-report-shows"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are increasingly cut with fentanyl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning people may overdose without even knowing they are taking the opioid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had two close childhood friends who passed away from fentanyl overdose," Gage said. "Neither of them were seeking it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Over 48,000 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to have died of opioid overdoses in 2024 in the U.S., according to provisional data. Perhaps due to this high death toll, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/Supplement_1/S98/6586840" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/Supplement_1/S98/6586840" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early research suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that people with personal experience with opioid use disorder and the general public alike view a possible anti-fentanyl vaccine positively. Time will tell how the new vaccine will perform in human trials, but if eventually approved, it could be a first-of-its-kind tool against overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="d9b3f4c9-cd5c-44d2-8e58-9b3cd0c3c9a4"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The powerful drugs — taken by millions — have long been known to potentially trigger symptoms including dizziness, headaches, insomnia and nausea when coming off them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, there are no real guidelines: When medication is stopped, there is no follow up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To assess the health impact of overprescribing, experts from the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health and Service Evaluation, cross-examined over 75 studies to work out the best way for a patient to come off the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysing medical records from over 17,000 individuals, the researchers found the most effective method is gradually lowering the dosage alongside seeing a therapist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, this could help prevent relapse in one in five patients, helping dramatically reduce the number of patients unable to get off of antidepressants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were followed for around a year, with those who abruptly stopped taking their medication found to be at a 40 per cent risk of relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who gradually came off antidepressants, whilst seeing a psychiatrist, however reduced their risk of relapse by nearly 50 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, the study found, was almost as effective as continued drug usage without psychological support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that guidelines on coming off antidepressants should 'promote individualised deprescribing with gradual tapering and structured psychological support.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Giovanni Ostuzzi, study co-author also from the University of Verona, added: 'Continuing with or without psychological support, slow tapering with the psychological support and continuing at the antidepressant at reduced doses had similar benefits in preventing relapse within the first year after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Abrupt stopping or fast tapering carried the highest risk of relapse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope that their study will pave the way for more personalised prescribing practices and help more patients come off the drugs sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our new review clarifies the scientific evidence about the most effective way to come off antidepressants for individuals successfully treated for depression and could change how coming off antidepressants is managed globally,' Prof Oztuzzi added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the need for clinical guidelines to be updated to promote regular treatment reviews and individualised deprescribing with gradual tapering and structured psychological support for patients with depression who are feeling better and wish to come off their medication.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, experts who were not involved in the current study have expressed concern over patients coming off medication too quickly, without the support of their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Henssler, MD, an expert in evidence-based mental health, stressed: 'The best patient outcomes were achieved with strategies that maintained antidepressant therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that currently both pharmaceutical treatment and psychotherapy are limited in their curative capacity- meaning that for effective usage, both need to be used in adjunct, which is not always feasible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-5e8755b0-e4b0-11f0-b285-a1098cd4136c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15419207/come-antidepressants-avoid-effects.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What are antidepressants? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are around 30 different types that can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says that most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants. But it notes that this isn't the case for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects vary between different people and antidepressants but can include nausea, headaches, a dry mouth and problems having sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants aren't addictive but patients may have withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include an upset stomach, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, dizziness and vivid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts highlighted the the follow-up period of the study was relatively short, meaning it is difficult to make long-term conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Alberto Oritz Lobo, a leading psychiatrist at La Paz University, welcomed the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'This is a crucial study given the alarming increase in antidepressant prescriptions and the need to consider strategies for reducing their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The usual clinical reality is that, after people improve, antidepressant treatment is often continued for months, years, or indefinitely, leading to chronic adverse effects of the medication, exposure to its risks, and brain neuroadaptation that makes stopping the medication difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that gradually reducing the dose helps support changes in the brain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Continuing, he said: 'Psychological support provides confidence and security in this process, in which the person regains their agency and autonomy, reappropriates their emotions and stops delegating their well-being to a medication.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latest NHS data shows a record 8.8million people in England are now on the mood-boosting drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common SSRIs prescribed in the UK include citalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline, sometimes known by brand names Cipramil, Prozac and Lustral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their use has been linked to long-term and even permanent sexual dysfunction by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS has warned that side effects such as a loss of libido and achieving orgasm, lower sperm count and erectile dysfunction 'can persist' after taking them — and patients have described feeling 'carved out', relationships wrecked, from their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most medics, and the NHS, consider the use of SSRI for depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, as worthwhile given the debilitating nature of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:09:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxObHIyODlrMk5zdUd3ZEpnYW93LTYxdTNJaVU2cTNLSWw0WHVnQVk2T05McDNwWVl0TU5QWnR2WjJXZHZYb3FKQW9qakZHTDBvZ3p1ek5BclpvTjhuZ2xGSE5iQXA2RmdSdU90N05PdGg2cDdmaXZDN3BMYllyT2ZFUjFFRXp2VkZJVHVRNTVhRlZDT3lnOWfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTXZfTFdkQ080dnJmNm5vVk1PZGUyVldJbnRxN0dBMHdUaVdiMlFSUE9kM0FfUEJncEhuaXNOU2RRdjZKZUYzbjkyMVJZd2duM09fMDBSc0xzS3BFNW1kekp4NktaOGpLY0ljWHIwVHlrbGxheDJUUHRjaHg1VGw1Y0pMUEMtX2J0NE9CcXR5Y19sMFY3ZlJGaGFZX3c</guid></item><item><title>想在2026年改善您的健康状况吗？简明扼要-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/wellness-influencers-politics-fiber-protein-longevity-9969ef29b9cf29fe5fded67637351c7c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;The new year is a time when many try to start new good habits and commit to improving health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But resolutions, lofty as they may be, can turn daunting quickly with all the advice and sometimes contradicting information coming at you from news reports, advertisers, influencers, friends and even politicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they don’t have to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, The Associated Press got the downlow on all manner of health and wellness claims and fads. The good news is that the experts mostly say to keep it simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 2026 arrives, here’s what you can skip, what you should pay attention to and how to get credible information when you are inevitably faced with more confusing claims next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein and fiber are important, but you probably don’t need to pay more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your diet, experts say most people can skip the upcharge. If you’re eating enough, you’re &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/high-protein-muscle-food-nutrition-e3bd1ddb197139bdf7fe67a09fcdf32e"&gt;probably getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and don’t need products that promise some big boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s true that most people could use more fiber in their diets. But, please, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fiber-fibermaxxing-digestion-wellness-730bdd5f68f448fe979f4ebd598e2340"&gt;ditch the “fiber-maxxing” trend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Instead, eat whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;A good skin care routine is not expensive or complicated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 20-step skin care routine and $200 serum some TikToker sold you on? &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/skin-care-retinol-red-light-therapy-beef-tallow-16ce2a56462995c41054fdf147814d7e"&gt;Dermatologists say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you really don’t need it. Stay away from the beef tallow and slather on a good sunscreen instead (yes, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sunscreen-for-dark-skin-tones-cccd4a0c1cea4e4a5ca6a67c00a5b5c5"&gt;even if you have darker skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the same rule for simplicity applies to that hourlong “everything shower.” The best showers are simple and short, dermatologists say, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/shower-basics-tiktok-social-media-dermatologist-8a96743d7b86c329703f7736a7306961"&gt;no “double cleansing” required&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;h2&gt;There are many simple ways to get that workout in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the gym and all its equipment feel intimidating, you can drop the illusion that a good workout requires either. This year, the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/calisthenics-exercises-fitness-body-weight-c9f2f9c44c36a3078f5ffeb744c094d2"&gt;comeback of calisthenics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put the focus back on no frills, bodyweight workouts you can do in the comfort of home. Research shows calisthenics helps with muscle strength and aerobic conditioning. You may eventually need weightlifting or other equipment, but it is a great place to start to build consistency and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Be wary of wellness fads and treatments — they are often too good to be true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you imbibe too much this New Year’s Eve, doctors say you can do without “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/retail-iv-therapy-drip-hydration-e335f09bc013739aa69fa43d92bc4945"&gt;IV therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” which have vitamins you can get more easily and cheaper in pill form — if you even need more, which is unlikely if you have a balanced diet. You’re pretty much just paying for “expensive urine,” one doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same for “wellness” focused products like &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gut-health-test-microbiome-probiotics-diet-f61947edfc591616639253eeb7a8c3e0"&gt;microbiome testing kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that generate information that doctors can’t actually act on. And if you don’t have diabetes, there’s scant evidence that you need &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/continuous-glucose-monitor-cgm-diabetes-75469f79bc649cab0d831e6ec52758a7"&gt;a continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;To improve your health, go back to the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a panacea pill, product or routine can be enticing. But science already knows a lot about how to improve mental and physical health, and they are tried and true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lifestyle changes don’t just make you feel better in the moment. Research shows they impact your life for years to come, by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/brain-health-dementia-exercise-diet-33fe2ed685acc30452005e53eba11410"&gt;lowering the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and many other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t know who to trust? Start with your doctor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tough to know who to listen to about your health, faced with compelling personal stories on social media from people who swear something worked from them, or clever marketing and advertising from companies that scare you or promise an easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts have been raised this year about established medicine, including the safety of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/synthetic-dyes-red-3-artificial-colors-ef5af10b3aca66d0033d3f239546f1aa"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-treatment-dental-teeth-78371f76118a1c7b8bf954d19b641d26"&gt;fluoride dental treatments,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-acip-a6032868d6025e2c527c574222fcabf3"&gt;hepatitis B shot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for newborns, and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hormone-therapy-estrogen-hot-flashes-fda-5b1f29a73553c142f67b1f88b6656428"&gt;hormone therapies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the medical system is not perfect, your doctor remains the best person to talk to about prevention, health concerns and potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t get to a human doctor and turn to Dr. Google instead, be sure to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-internet-medical-advice-9d4c56da3e598e694b2cf99b4eb5b71b"&gt;follow these tips and never use it to diagnose yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflammation risk can go up in the winter, and what you eat is important to keep it in check. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing colorful fruits help reduce inflammation and deliver other key nutrients. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These fruits, including grapefruit and kiwi, are in season during the winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The secret to feeling your best this January could be lurking in the produce aisle. According to &lt;a href="https://www.mynutritionandme.com/about-us#meet-the-dietitian" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karolin Saweres, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, “​​Low-grade inflammation often increases during winter due to reduced sunlight exposure, changes in activity levels, higher stress and shifts toward more energy-dense, lower-fiber diets.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;While inflammation is a natural immune response, chronic &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-grade inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can zap your energy levels and make it harder for your body to fight off seasonal bugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If staying energized through dark winter days and dodging more cold and flu germs than you catch is high on your priority list, you’re in luck. Many winter fruits are rich in polyphenols, vitamin C and other antioxidants to support the immune system and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/antioxidant-rich-fruits-for-inflammation-11794100" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, explains Saweres, while also “supporting gut microbial diversity and intestinal barrier function, both of which play a central role in regulating systemic inflammation.” Whether you’re looking to support your body through sick season or simply want to feel your best as you ease into the new year, here are five seasonal anti-inflammatory fruits dietitians recommend enjoying this winter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-kiwi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Kiwi &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eat your greens” usually refers to vegetables, but a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kiwi will do the trick&lt;/a&gt; if you’re eating to manage inflammation. “One medium kiwi provides roughly 7% of your recommended Daily Value for vitamin E, which helps slow the production of molecules that promote inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://elizabethharrisnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elizabeth Harris, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to vitamin E, you’ll also find a good amount of vitamin C in just one kiwifruit. This antioxidant supports immune health, protects the body from oxidative stress and helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regulate the inflammatory response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While snacking on plain kiwi (even the skin!) is perfectly acceptable, you can slice it up over granola and yogurt for breakfast or make a simple fruit salad. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-grapefruit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Grapefruit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grapefruits don’t have the weight-loss superpower that was once believed (anyone remember the grapefruit diet?), but they are an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-grapefruit-8783128" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incredibly nutritious fruit&lt;/a&gt;, supporting your health in a number of ways. “Grapefruit is packed with vitamin C and flavonoids that support anti-inflammatory pathways, insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have even found evidence that regularly consuming grapefruit may help regulate gene expression involved in inflammation, resulting in enhanced cardioprotective benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berger recommends tossing the segments with a simple green salad dressed with olive oil and cracked pepper for a nourishing and refreshing side. Just be sure to check if grapefruit interacts with any medications you may be taking before adding it to the grocery list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-persimmons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Persimmons &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to an apricot, with a honey-like flavor, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-eat-persimmons-8724541" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;persimmons&lt;/a&gt; can add sweetness to salads and color to yogurt bowls, or can be simply eaten on their own. With a bright orange hue, they’re rich in carotenoids, helping protect the body against heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancers through their influence on the immune system and regulation of inflammatory compounds in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to their high antioxidant content, persimmons are rich in fiber, with 6 grams per small fruit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The fiber in persimmons has been shown to support beneficial gut bacteria and help dial down inflammatory signals,” says &lt;a href="https://peaceandpancakes.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Talia Follador, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Enjoying a sliced persimmon with probiotic-packed yogurt is an excellent way to support a diverse microbiome while keeping inflammation in check. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-oranges"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Oranges &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stocking up on juicy, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-oranges-11680294" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet oranges&lt;/a&gt; brightens up the frozen months of January and February. Not only are they so much more flavorful than at other times of year, but they’re loaded with the immune-supporting nutrients our bodies need. “Oranges are rich in vitamin C and citrus flavonoids—especially hesperidin and naringenin—which help regulate inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress,” says Follador.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while a glass of orange juice will provide many vitamins and flavonoids that support your immune system and reduce inflammation, snacking on whole oranges provides even more benefit. Researchers have found that the fiber and polyphenols in whole fruits further reduce inflammation and exert a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotic effect in the gut&lt;/a&gt;, producing short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy oranges plain, blend them in a smoothie, or eat them in a bright and fresh &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249105/orange-avocado-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;orange and avocado salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The effort of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-prep-and-eat-a-pomegranate-8719579" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;opening a pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; is well worth it when you consider how nutritious (and delicious) those little juicy arils are. “Pomegranate contains powerful polyphenols, particularly punicalagins and anthocyanins, which play a role in lowering inflammation and supporting heart health,” says Berger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several studies have found that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;effects of pomegranates go beyond heart health&lt;/a&gt;, supporting symptom reduction from menopausal hormonal changes and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berger recommends sprinkling pomegranate arils over roasted squash or sweet potatoes for a beautiful and flavorful contrast. And if the daunting task of peeling pomegranates is preventing you from enjoying them more often, buying them pre-peeled and frozen is a handy solution.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The cold winter months don’t have to leave you feeling sluggish or run-down.

He said when a patient came in with a heart attack, you sat by their bed, and you gave morphine and maybe some nitroglycerin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AIWYIGSP4BD6BAIIA6MPXSGPNQ"&gt;“They either died or lived” he said. “You didn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZR7B2CRYC5DKJAUVYHFJLYUKMM"&gt;If a patient survived, he said treatment options were limited and only the wealthy had access to bypass surgery in either Texas or New York, which had hospitals offering the latest in heart care technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PI5EOUSN7BGJTISS4LXSBZAZCY"&gt;Today, the landscape is unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WNLALIZ27BAJLN4YNC6DW3XJ64"&gt;“Now you come in with a heart attack, we give drugs that prevent worsening of the heart attack,” he said. “We put new heart valves in from the skin.

							&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Claims that a Chinese man underwent surgery so that his severed hand could be grafted onto his leg in order to preserve the limb until it could be reattached to his arm circulated online in early December 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internet users on sites &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1jio3vh/in_2013_chinese_doctors_saved_a_mans_severed_hand/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlyterrifying/comments/14hszfw/doctors_kept_chinese_factory_worker_xie_weis_hand/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have posted about this particular claim for years, but in December 2025 the rumor underwent a resurgence of popularity thanks to a series of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/142126849181880/?multi_permalinks=24072357562398807&amp;amp;hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen"&gt;&lt;span&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1452622612668132"&gt;&lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/3446372708812242/?multi_permalinks=9620228938093224&amp;amp;hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/1ywTs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;archived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/NxiXd"&gt;&lt;span&gt;archived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/BszGS"&gt;&lt;span&gt;archived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many posts shared the purported story along with photographs that alleged to show the result of the surgery in question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to internet users, the surgery was performed in order to keep the hand alive with a strong blood supply until it was able to be reattached where it belonged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One post called the surgery "a miracle shaped by hope and determination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The claim that a surgeon saved an injured man's severed hand by temporality grafting it to his leg and later reattached it to his arm was widely reported as a success by the news media when it allegedly occurred in December 2013. Snopes has not been able to review documentation of the surgery ourselves, so we have left this claim unrated, though widely available reporting and photographs suggested the claim was true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The surgery purportedly occurred at a hospital in Changsha, China, in which an injured worker, Xie Wei, lost his hand while operating a machine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A series of graphic photographs available for viewing on the reputable image repository &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?agreements=&amp;amp;family=editorial&amp;amp;phrase=hand%20graft%20to%20leg&amp;amp;sort=mostpopular&amp;amp;phraseprocessing=excludenaturallanguage"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; dated Dec. 4, 2013, appeared to be the origin of some of the images shared in the above social media posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getty captioned each photo with the below: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This picture taken on December 4, 2013 shows Xie Wei's hand grafted to his ankle in a hospital in Changsha, central China's Hunan province. Chinese doctors have saved his severed hand by grafting it to his ankle, local media reported. Xie Wei lost his right hand in an accident at work but could not have it reattached to his arm right away. Doctors kept the hand alive by stitching it to his left ankle and "borrowing" a blood supply from arteries in the leg. Later they managed to replant the hand back on his arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/photo/2013-12/17/content_17180637.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;China Daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also published an array of photographs of the procedure in December 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Snopes reached out to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/tangjuyu/en/hjxx/7324/list/index.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Juyu Tang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, reported to have been the one who conducted the surgery in question, for comment and a request for available documentation of the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tang was listed on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/tangjuyu/en/index/7318/list/index.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;faculty page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, which was described as having "well-known microsurgical experts." Additionally, the faculty page noted Tang was "chief physician, bone science professor, doctoral research tutor" and "current director and deputy director of the Department of Orthopedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University," located in Changsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tang was mentioned by name as the surgeon responsible in some reports from the time from outlets like the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-25405543"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/health/china-hand-leg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/photo/severed-hand-attached-mans-ankle-keep-it-alive-flna2d11758509"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/chinese-man-39-leg-proves-handy-solution-arm-100816299.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yahoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/life/why-china-s-doctors-seem-to-perform-such-wild-transplants/article_3bf55c4c-0712-5b3d-a90d-68e30191afff.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Toronto Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-17/an-china-hand-surgery/5162990?future=true&amp;amp;a"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (ABC) and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/photo/2013-12/17/content_17180637_5.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;China Daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/this-picture-taken-on-december-4-2013-shows-a-doctor-news-photo/457352137?adppopup=true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;particular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; photograph on Getty Images depicted a doctor who appeared to match the faculty photo of Tang on the Xiangya Medical College website. In 2015, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/health/gallery/zhou-severed-hand-operation"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published an image gallery from the surgery, which included some of the Getty Images photos as well as other photos identifying Tang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further, a list of Tang's published research on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juyu-Tang"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ResearchGate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a database for scientific research papers, clearly depicted his focus of study in skin graft techniques and tissue reconstruction. Tang's faculty page stated his focus of research as "the basic and clinical study of allograft composite tissue transplantation" and the "basic and clinical study of perforator flap [techniques]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perforator flaps, put simply, is a method of reconstructive surgery by which tissue from elsewhere on the body is used, such as the procedure allegedly performed by Tang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2008 editorial in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2605127/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The Medscape Journal of Medicine"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Steven Morris noted "the quest has always been to find the best tissue transfer with a dependable blood supply, which can be transferred reliably to close a defect":&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perforator flaps have become increasingly popular in reconstructive microsurgery. To close soft-tissue defects left by trauma or after the excision of tumors, reconstructive surgeons have employed a number of surgical techniques. These tissue transfers, which are also known as "flaps," have evolved over the past century from random-pattern flaps with an unknown blood supply, through axial-pattern flaps with a known blood supply to muscle and musculocutaneous flaps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The December 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/health/china-hand-leg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; report stated that the victim "recovered without complications" and his employer paid for the surgery, "which cost about 300,000 Chinese yuan, or about $49,400."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/life/why-china-s-doctors-seem-to-perform-such-wild-transplants/article_3bf55c4c-0712-5b3d-a90d-68e30191afff.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Toronto Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; quoted a University of Toronto plastic surgery professor, Dr. Dimitri Anastakis, who said of the surgery, "We've done comparable things at the University of Toronto… I'm impressed with the creativity… I'm impressed with the drive to save the person's hand and restore function… It's particularly cool…  In China, they do phenomenally creative work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By all accounts, the claim that Tang was able to save a man's hand by attaching it to his leg appeared to be true, but until we can look at the evidence first hand, this claim will remain unrated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A team of American scientists claim they have done something miraculous: they “cured” lab mice suffering from &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, which has robbed more than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lta2-jvsWco" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;seven million Americans&lt;/a&gt;, typically 65 years old and up, of their identity and cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers achieved this feat by administering the rodents with the powerful compound &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4163014/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;P7C3-A20&lt;/a&gt;, which they announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00608-1" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists from Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center undertook the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The key takeaway is a message of hope — the effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Andrew A. Pieper, the study’s principal investigator and a CWRU neuroscience professor, in a &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the research. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This research is part of a growing wave of very promising lab studies that point to a tantalizing future where Alzheimer’s and other neurological issues could be a thing of the past. Besides this P7C3-A20 research, others have scored remarkable lab results using different &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/northwestern-university-possible-alzheimers"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/flu-vaccine-alzheimers"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This has made normally cautious scientists so excited that they are making bold predictions. University of Edinburgh neuroscience professor Tara Spires-Jones, who wasn’t part of this P7C3-A20 study, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4dnwky48wo" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this month she thinks scientists are closer than ever to a “truly life-changing” treatment — in as little as five to 10 years; instead of a slow death where people lose themselves, she forecasts that new tests will detect the condition early and innovative treatments will “really make your life normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Scientists are also closer to understanding what causes Alzheimer’s, which seems to be sparked by different factors such as genetics, environment and other stressors — which means that future patients may receive personalized cocktail of anti-Alzheimer’s treatment and drugs suited for their own situation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Regardless of the cause, previous research has suggested that Alzheimer’s is a form of inflammation. That means lessening or zeroing out inflammation in the brain would be key rather than managing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the P7C3-A20 study, the scientists focused on the impact of the crucial molecule &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9512238/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt;, a coenzyme important for driving cellular metabolism and which decreases as we age, according to the study. Patients with Alzheimer’s suffer from a significant decrease of NAD+ in the brain, and hence their brain cells have trouble maintaining normal functionality, staving off inflammation, and canceling other physical hallmarks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;For the study, the team first took two types of lab mice that have been genetically bred to be predisposed to Alzheimer’s; one cohort had mutations for the amyloid protein and the other had tau protein mutations. Both proteins are important to cellular function, but they can become dangerous if they accrete in the brain in the form of amyloid plaques and tau tangles — causing a breakdown in normal cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The team injected P7C3-A20 into both mice cohorts at two months of age, later finding out that this treatment successfully prevented them from developing the disease. But the big news was when they injected the compound into another batch of lab mice, who were suffering from a relatively advanced stage of Alzheimer’s at six months of age; after getting injections, these mice completely recovered their cognitive ability and NAD+ levels were restored to homeostasis leve;s&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Pieper in the statement. “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain’s NAD+ balance is restored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;What’s also good about this study is that P7C3-A20 offers an alternative pathway to boosting NAD+ levels versus taking over-the-counter chemical precursors for NAD+, which can can raise NAD+ to such toxic levels that people could develop cancer, Pieper said. Supplements to boost NAD+ are just a click away on your cellphone, which should be worrying for anybody concerned about cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The team wants to move to human clinical trials but some people are clearly not waiting; if you search online on how to obtain P7C3-A20 for yourself,  numerous websites selling vials of the compound will pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

In the 1950s, after a World War II-era outbreak of gonorrhea and syphilis, there was even a heated debate over whether police could detain someone with a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current rule, partially established through that debate in the ‘50s and modified over the following decades, works like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health and Environment is charged with using “every available means to ascertain the existence of and to investigate immediately all suspected cases of sexually transmitted infections and to determine the source of such infections.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manager of the health department can order people to be tested for STIs, force them to report to qualified health care providers for counseling, and direct people to cease and desist from “specific conduct that poses risks to the public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least according to the rules, physicians at “any hospital or institution” have an obligation to report people with STIs to the head of the health department with a slew of information, including marital status, occupation, whether the patient handles dairy products and other foods, the name and address of any sex workers associated with the infection, and any habits the person has that could lead to the infection of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legally speaking, people “afflicted with any venereal disease” also have 48 hours to begin treatment with a physician or must report their condition to the head of the health department, providing their name, address and occupation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists who fill a prescription to treat venereal diseases also have 24 hours to report that to the head of the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the city generally doesn’t enforce any of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In practice, Denver has shifted its responsibilities to the state. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the city doesn’t collect this kind of STI information anymore, health-care providers do have to make similar reports to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports to the state do not require the same scope of information (for example, whether a person handled dairy), but they do include personal information: name, address, gender, race, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that the current system of providers and labs reporting sexually transmitted infections to CDPHE meets the needs and goals of the Denver statute, which serves as an additional measure for prevention and protection in Denver, should it be needed,” Amber Campbell, a spokesperson for DDPHE, wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state uses the information to help stop the spread of STIs — and other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the state receives most STI data, the city doesn’t see many self-reports. But when they do happen, the city has to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone reported to us that another individual is knowingly spreading infection to partners,  we would have a responsibility to investigate and enforce the statute,” Campbell added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chances of that happening are slim. Removing the law from the city books, though, would take some time and the approval of the Denver City Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Denverite</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBQcEhrOGhxVlFLVFEtelJlQjhoQW5zclBfaTRzY21uQXFFWlVEb0IyOEFoWVpkRnkyTVNKS2dQVnJyQ2JNM0xONTc0R1M3c1k1RzVlVHI3ZU9zd3c4N2ZsSm9LZkduaXhOV0NV</guid></item><item><title>我以采访营养学家为生–以下是他们都同意的饮食建议-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/best-diet-tips-fat-loss-nutrition-experts-b2883459.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gIQPHK sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here is a lot of diet advice on the internet – some good, some not so good, some terrible. As &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;senior fitness writer, I interview experts weekly in an attempt to cut through this noise and bring readers accessible, effective tips that benefit their &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter which expert I’m speaking to, there are several underlying features of a nutritious adult &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; that remain largely undisputed: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat a wide variety of plant-based foods including plenty of vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose wholefoods where possible &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on hitting fibre requirements – at least 30g per day &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume adequate protein from lean sources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods with excessive saturated fat and added sugar should form only a small portion of your diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume an appropriate number of calories for your build and activity levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were to follow this advice consistently, chances are your health would be in a pretty positive place. Add regular &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; into the mix and you’re running in the right direction. But there are other key tips that have stayed with me in 2025 – which I have compiled for you below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritise nutritious foods you can add to your diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Appetite is finite,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEverything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh%2Fdp%2FB0BT733QD8%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7CB0BT733QD8%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Fat Loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; author and experienced trainer Ben Carpenter tells me. “I like focusing on adding nutritious foods into your diet because they tend to displace other foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one study Carpenter cites found that children encouraged to eat more apples – a food rich in nutrients and high in fibre – actually lowered their daily caloric intake. The fruit had elbowed other less nutritious, energy-dense food out of the picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says most people have a good idea what is meant by nutritious food, but adds that opting for items that “tend to be slightly less processed” is a good rule of thumb to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, fruits and vegetables, lean proteins [white fish, white meat, soy, tofu], beans, lentils and wholegrains,” Carpenter lists. “Even things like rice and oats as opposed to donuts, pancakes and waffles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/bold-bean-co-gut-health-recipes-b2842333.html"&gt;How fibremaxxing became the secret to better gut-health and easy recipes to use now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Incorporating more nutritious foods in your diet can displace more energy-dense, less nutritious alternatives" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519624"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Incorporating more nutritious foods in your diet can displace more energy-dense, less nutritious alternatives&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance wins over ultra-extreme every time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From carnivore to keto, extreme diets will continue to grab headlines – yet the definition of diet isn’t something short-term, but rather the foods you habitually eat. By this logic, it makes sense to stick with something sustainable and health-promoting, rather than following an unmanageably restrictive regime for a few weeks before inevitably falling back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than being ultra-extreme, focus on balance,” advises &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eating-a-balanced-diet/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; GP Dr Radha Modgil. “One of the big things we can all do is look at how many fruits and vegetables we’re eating each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have to be fresh, they can be canned, dried or frozen, but the evidence shows that if we at least eat our five a day, we have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Modgil points to the NHS’s Eatwell Guide as an example of how to structure a balanced diet. It recommends that a third of the food we eat should be fruit and vegetables, another third should be starchy foods high in fibre such as wholegrains, then the remainder should comprise items such as beans, pulses, lean protein sources and dairy (or dairy alternatives). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, sugary soft drinks, butter and ice cream are non-essential additions to your diet, “so should be eaten less often and in smaller amounts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kSPTgz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="NHS GP Dr Radha Modgil says the Eatwell Guide provides a good template for constructing a healthy meal and wider diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519625"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;NHS GP Dr Radha Modgil says the Eatwell Guide provides a good template for constructing a healthy meal and wider diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Public Health England)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-reduce-diabetes-risk-b2878819.html"&gt;What the shape of your buttock muscles might mean for your future health – and how to change it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alter your food environment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human body and brain like to take the path of least resistance, particularly when your schedule becomes hectic. If you can make healthy options more practical, you drastically increase your chance of choosing them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do this. Preparing your lunches in advance is the most obvious, stopping you from splashing the cash on fast food during office days. But there are other quick things you can do that will push your eating habits in a positive direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking up a lean protein source like a chicken or block of tofu at the start of your week, then having it in your fridge, can make it easier to whip up nutritious meals when you’re short on time in the evenings. Having fruit on your desk in the office can encourage smarter snacking, while placing nutritious snacks such as carrots and hummus in compartments at the front of your fridge or cupboard means you can mindlessly graze on these nourishing foods with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final tip is omitting products high in saturated fat and added sugars – such as crisps and chocolate – from your weekly food shop, meaning you have to leave the house and buy them if you want to eat them. Putting an extra hurdle between you and the action you’re looking to cut back on makes you less likely to do it, and if you do pop to the shops you’ll be adding a bit of extra movement into your day – a win-win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-heart-health-b2859776.html"&gt;The science-backed two-minute daily workouts for improving heart health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dywRpZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Preparing nutritious meals in advance can make healthy choices easier to take later in the week" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519626"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Preparing nutritious meals in advance can make healthy choices easier to take later in the week&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on fibre as well as protein &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both protein and fibre are essential,” says Dr Karan Rajan, a surgeon and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThis-Book-Save-Your-Life-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0BY1R4D7V%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7CB0BY1R4D7V%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Book May Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There are plenty of foods and meal combos where you can get both, but if I had to over-index on one, it would be fibre. I’d say the average person probably consumes enough protein and nowhere near enough fibre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023-report"&gt;National Diet and Nutrition Survey&lt;/a&gt;, 96 per cent of UK adults are falling shy of their 30g daily fibre requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to human physiology, there [aren’t many processes that] fibre isn’t involved in, either directly or indirectly,” Dr Rajan continues. “Its benefits include regulating hormones, metabolism, appetite, the gut microbiome, mood, bowels and more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre can be found in plant-based foods such as lentils, beans and peas, as well as wholegrains such as oats and barley, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is also important, playing a role in many bodily processes such as building and repairing tissues (including, most notably, muscle) and supporting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommended nutrient intake for protein in the UK is 0.75 grams per kilogram of body weight,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/javier-gonzalez"&gt;Professor Javier Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of nutrition and metabolism at the University of Bath’s Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some good arguments that a little higher than this – up to 1.2g/kg – may have additional benefits for muscle health and weight control. The requirements of athletes can be even higher than this – up to around 1.8g/kg.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts I speak to argue that the majority of people are already consuming enough protein. However, as Dr Gonzalez explains above, those who exercise may benefit from a slightly higher daily intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a specialist registered dietitian and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FHow-Not-Eat-Ultra-Processed-life-changing%2Fdp%2F1529940117%2Fref%3Dasc_df_1529940117%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2846584%7C1529940117%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed&lt;/a&gt;, recommends aiming to include both protein and fibre in your snack choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think apple and cheese, berries and yoghurt, carrots and hummus, or nuts and dried fruit,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/ultra-processed-food-lancet-medical-journal-b2868062.html"&gt;The five ultra-processed food ingredients to avoid on packaging – and what to buy instead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 laKbvU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine recommends aiming to include both fibre and protein in your snacks – for example, carrots and hummus" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519627"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine recommends aiming to include both fibre and protein in your snacks – for example, carrots and hummus&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat your CAP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-nutrition-diet-b2789919.html"&gt;Gut health&lt;/a&gt; is a buzz term in the fitness industry right now. Fermented items such as kimchi, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kombucha-drink-health-benefits-scoby-equinox-b2848346.html"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt; and sauerkraut are widely seen as the key to a more settled stomach – something that plugs into a huge range of systems in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnny Drain, a fermentation expert and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FAdventures-Fermentation-Culinary-Frontiers-Exploration%2Fdp%2F0241699134%2Fref%3Dasc_df_0241699134%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2765194%7C0241699134%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventures in Fermentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says his golden rule for gut health is to “eat your CAP” – an acronym for “colourful array of plant-based foods”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are associations between a more diverse gut microbiome and improved mood and cognition, improved mental health, improved immune function and improved digestion,” Dr Drain explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are essentially a tube – you put something in at the top and other stuff comes out of the bottom. The game is getting as many nutrients from it as possible in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbes in our gut help us extract nutrients from the food we eat. Research, such as this 2023 study from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-12-15-study-shows-diverse-gut-bacteria-communities-protect-against-harmful-pathogens"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, suggests improved gut microbiome diversity is associated with better health outcomes, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People that have some diseases, such as metabolic diseases, might have a less diverse microbiome,” explains Dr Drain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Gut Health (or Microsetta Initiative) study showed that consuming 30 or more different plant foods per week can increase gut microbiome diversity, and consequently gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds and even herbs and spices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of fermented foods with live cultures such as kefir, live yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi and miso has also been associated with positive impacts on gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2837119.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gFcOVD"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Fermented foods such as kimchi can contribute to a more diverse gut microbiome and improved gut health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519628"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Fermented foods such as kimchi can contribute to a more diverse gut microbiome and improved gut health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know where to find polyphenols&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols are plant-based dietary compounds found in a wide variety of foods and drinks, from berries to green tea to dark chocolate. They overlap heavily with fibre, although emerging research points towards these compounds having health perks in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rajan, they have anti-inflammatory properties, they can improve cardiometabolic function and they support endothelial function (related to the lining of the blood vessels). Polyphenols may also aid lipid modulation and directly impact gut microbiome health, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review article, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725000790"&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2025, also pointed towards polyphenols having anti-ageing effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where can you find them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries – especially blueberries, blackberries and strawberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cocoa and dark chocolate – 70 per cent cocoa or higher&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea and coffee &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grapes and red wine – “Though alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better,” says Dr Rajan &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples and pears &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric – curcumin is the active compound – and other herbs and spices &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts such as almonds or walnuts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Onions and garlic &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than targeting specific polyphenols in the supermarket, Dr Rajan recommends shaping your wider diet to include several sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A Mediterranean-style diet is naturally rich in polyphenols,” he says. “Small daily choices, like opting for black coffee, snacking on a couple of squares of dark chocolate, eating some mixed berries and having olive oil with meals, will add up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/diet-and-exercise-advice-for-longevity-b2833750.html"&gt;Scientists reveal the small lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of heart disease and add 10 years to your life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 eFcuEG"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Blueberries, almonds and dark chocolate all contain polyphenols" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519629"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Blueberries, almonds and dark chocolate all contain polyphenols&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritise wholefoods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed food (UPF) is another phrase that has hit the mainstream in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris van Tulleken, a professor of global health and infection at University College London, and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FUltra-Processed-People-Stuff-That-Isnt%2Fdp%2F1529900050%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7C1529900050%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, applies the working definition: “If the packaging you are reading has an ingredient that you don’t typically find in a domestic kitchen, like an emulsifier or a flavouring, then it’s very likely to be an ultra-processed food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of UPF continues to stir up debate, but a systematic review published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; medical journal this year detailed a link between UPF consumption and non-communicable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can find a way of eating real food, we’re very sure that’s better for you,” says van Tulleken. “You don’t have to believe any of the evidence around ultra-processed food to say that’s true – that’s established in nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, he recommends asking yourself a simple question before you buy or eat any food and drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Was this food prepared with the purpose of protecting my health and nourishing me? If the answer to that question is no, then I think you should contemplate if you want to eat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Count your drinks in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we drink is often seen as separate diet, but everything we put in our body will have some sort of impact – large or small, positive or negative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water is always the healthiest option of any drink,” says Dr Modgil. “Our brains are nearly 80 per cent water, so it’s something we obviously need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to drink regularly throughout the day and avoid sugary drinks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes the usual suspect such as energy drinks and fizzy drinks, as well as limiting fruit juices and smoothies to one small glass per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though there is fruit in there, they are still quite high in sugar,” Dr Modgil explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other small changes you can make include adding less sugar to your tea and coffee, and drinking alcohol in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current guidelines are 14 units per week,” says neuropsychopharmacologist and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com/?cuid=xid:fr1765816255343fda&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsentiaspirits.com%2Fpages%2Fabout&amp;amp;articleId=b2846549&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Sentia&lt;/a&gt; co-founder Professor David Nutt. “If you can stick within those, the harms of alcohol are relatively minor.

And don’t stockpile. If you’re going to try and stick to the 14 units, don’t take them in one go because that’s going to be more deleterious to your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/food-inflation-rising-why-climate-change-meat-price-b2868901.html"&gt;Inflation is down – so why is your food shop getting even more expensive?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQWUNQUmlwR2QwY01UbFpOeHJzV2FYVngxQVg0Qm0weHhFYnZ2WURLMGI2QkNUV1c0ZXJfVlJxQWNISmdzQTBiTEw3Njg1eDZtVnFVYzF0WWFPMkRvT051RGE0UXBySXlWV25aY2k2OFF1RUlYcTFkbFByR1lGNk1lNEhoS3FSRVF0X0R3dnRLUUVOLWYxZ0QzOUpwbks2ZHlQQ2h5YjN1WQ</guid></item><item><title>专家质疑丹麦的疫苗计划是美国的典范--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/world/europe/denmark-vaccine-schedule-rfk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:01:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPQ285OFRBTWFqUmZXVU96T21kcWFjNXhzdHVBQUNGUmxZNndIRXZVZE5WOGh3ZmVhSjY1R1JXUTJvOHRaS3NJVTJFYWpMNVZMQ0s3eGp6cHFsaERmbkQ5clRyOFlzWEtDNVY4MmFuRmlQLVVqcnhNQUVBN29JTlZac0x2RkhFY2VK</guid></item><item><title>Kratom和7-OH产品可广泛使用。它们也是公共卫生辩论的核心。：短波- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/29/nx-s1-5633323/kratom-fda-drug-addictive-opioids</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Kratom and 7-OH products are available in many smoke shops. Some people use them instead of opioids. Others say they're addictive – and should be better regulated.

They're available in many smoke shops, but the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-steps-restrict-7-oh-opioid-products-threatening-american-consumers" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration says&lt;/a&gt; certain products are highly addictive — and could lead to the next wave of the opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time kratom has come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade ago, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2016/08/30/dea-announces-intent-schedule-kratom" target="_blank"&gt;wanted to classify&lt;/a&gt; the active ingredients in kratom in the same category as heroin. That meant products would have gone from being widely available to highly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;restricted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Following the announcement, there was a massive wave of protest from advocates and lawmakers — including people who said they used kratom products to wean themselves off opioids.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The DEA decided not to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today on the show, we dive into what could happen with the FDA's scheduling change, and what researchers do – and don't – know about kratom and 7-OH.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more of the science behind drugs and supplements?

She added, “After an overnight fast, the body is more insulin-resistant in the morning. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;That means if you have a high-carb meal first thing in the morning, your blood sugar is going to spike up higher, and your insulin levels are going to go higher than if you had eaten the same meal later in the day.&lt;/span&gt;” The body&lt;span class="highlight"&gt; is so sensitive, becoming insulin resistant during the early hours of the day, that if you eat the same meal any other time, the spike won't be as high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She advised avoiding having cereal, pastries, or juice on an empty stomach as they all contribute to rapid blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What should you have instead?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what should you actually eat? &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Since your breakfast has such a big impact on your health, choosing the right meal becomes critical to avoid ripple effects like energy crashes, sugar spikes, and increased fat storage later in the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The endocrinologist suggested, “Starting the day with a low-carb, protein-forward breakfast can help reduce glucose and insulin spikes, improve energy, and support metabolic health throughout the day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides blood sugar spikes, the doctor noted that when insulin levels rise, the body is prompted to store fat. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Insulin is also a hormone of fat storage, so if your insulin levels are high, it's telling your body to store fat rather than burn it,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt; A high-protein, low-carb breakfast can easily counter this response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One can choose options like: eggs, Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, chia pudding, avocado, and nuts. This simple breakfast shift can especially be helpful for people with insulin resistance, PCOS, prediabetes, and stubborn weight gain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

But if you’re sluggish and stopped up, you have lots of company. Constipation is so common that 1 in 6 of us are regularly backed up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And, as annoying as constipation may be, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030662/normal-reasons-youre-constipated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;it’s totally normal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to relieving constipation, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; is king, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8049006/health-benefits-of-edamame/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt; is filled with it, says &lt;a href="https://eatwelltobewellrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cheryl Mussatto, M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Edamame offers a powerful combo of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, each with its own constipation-preventing powers. “Soluble fiber helps draw water into stools, making them softer and easier to pass, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to stools, promoting regular bowel movements,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One cup of edamame delivers an impressive 8 grams of fiber, or about one-fourth to one-third of most people's daily requirements (28 grams for women and 34 grams for men).&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s encouraging news, considering more than 90% of us don’t get nearly enough roughage in our diets.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame is a quick and easy snack to prep. Simply boil, steam or microwave the frozen pods or shelled soybeans. Then, flavor them with the seasoning of your choice. Or blend them into hummus and serve with your favorite veggies or whole-grain bread or crackers for additional fiber and crunch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lima beans pack a whopping 10 grams of fiber per cup, making them an excellent choice for staying regular, plus they’re a heart-healthy powerhouse, says Mussatto.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;While lima beans are typically added to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944538/orange-mint-freekeh-salad-with-lima-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salads&lt;/a&gt;, stews and soups, they’re also a gut-healthy snack. Roast or air-fry the beans, then dress them with salt, chile flakes, paprika or your favorite seasoning. Just be sure to cook them for at least 10 minutes, as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899208/are-raw-lima-beans-deadly-poisonous/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;raw limas&lt;/a&gt; contain compounds that can be poisonous.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber-rich avocados are a natural win for gut health, says Mussatto. “[They] are a fiber powerhouse, packing about 10 grams per fruit. That’s more than one-third of a daily recommendation for fiber,” she says.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They’re delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264173/avocado-salsa-cracker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mashed and topped with salsa&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tomato-avocado-dip-7969168" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chunky Tomato-Avocado Dip&lt;/a&gt;. For even more fiber, mash an avocado and slather it on a slice of whole-grain bread, says &lt;a href="https://www.fburgfitness.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer Scherer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scherer is also a huge fan of popcorn. “Popcorn is a whole grain high in insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to stools and helps them pass through the digestive system more easily,” she says. Just one single-serve 2-ounce bag packs an impressive 6 grams of roughage.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sweet, juicy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292095/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-pears/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pears&lt;/a&gt; are another constipation-preventing powerhouse, boasting nearly 6 grams of fiber per fruit.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s more than 20% of your daily dose! Plus, their fiber-rich skins bulk up your stools, says Mussatto. But that’s not the only way pears give you a push. Pears contain sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that acts as a laxative, drawing water into the colon, which makes stools softer and easier to pass.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cereal isn’t just for breakfast anymore! A bowl of whole-grain cereal is a quick, easy way to add digestion-friendly fiber to your day. And when you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918189/healthiest-milks-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pair it with cow’s milk or soy milk&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a fast way to rack up some satiating protein. However, all cereals aren’t created equal, so label-reading is key. Look for brands that contain at least 3 grams of fiber and no more than &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291098/best-cold-cereal-brands-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;10 grams of added sugars&lt;/a&gt; per serving.

But these underestimated little berries pack 10 grams of fiber per cup. That’s more than a third of the fiber you need in an entire day.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Scherer credits raspberries’ high fiber content to their hundreds of tiny seed-filled drupelets, the little bead-like fruits that make up each raspberry.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

So it is critical to identify it early, right during the process of artery blockage. Let's take a closer look at a related condition called atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up inside the arteries. This subsequently leads to blocked arteries, which reduce or stop blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Saurabh Juneja, Director &amp;amp; HOD, Cardiology, ISIC Multi-Speciality Hospital, shared with HT Lifestyle how one can detect it early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He explained the condition, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis is a formidable and often silent adversary, a chronic condition characterised by the gradual hardening and narrowing of arteries due to the build-up of plaque.” This condition is progressive in nature, and the cardiologist noted that the initial stages are usually asymptomatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also shared how this condition leads to blocked arteries, “&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease that typically begins with damage to the inner lining of an artery. The damage initiates an inflammatory response, leading to the accumulation of plaque. As plaque continues to grow, it stiffens and narrows the arteries, impeding the smooth flow of blood.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why is atherosclerosis a ‘silent killer’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Juneja flagged this condition as a ‘silent killer' as it can grow slowly in the body for years without showing any visible symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later on, it appears only after significant damage has already occurred, often without the individual being aware. The cardiologist warned of major emergencies such as heart attacks, strokes and severe cardiovascular conditions. This happens as eventually the artery becomes narrowed or completely blocked. It is alarming, as Dr Juneja remarked, one can live for decades without any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risk factors and vulnerable groups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some lifestyle and pre-existing factors that make a person more likely to develop this condition. Dr Juneja listed the risk factors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High cholesterol (particularly high LDL, "bad" cholesterol)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obesity and physical inactivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unhealthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, certain groups of people are more vulnerable to developing atherosclerosis. Dr Juneja outlined these groups, making it important for individuals in them to be especially vigilant about presentation and early detection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with metabolic conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Those diagnosed with hypertension, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol), or diabetes are at a substantially elevated risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smokers&lt;/strong&gt;: Tobacco use is one of the most potent risk factors, directly damaging arterial walls and accelerating plaque formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with unhealthy lifestyles: &lt;/strong&gt;Sedentary habits and diets rich in saturated/trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium contribute significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older age: &lt;/strong&gt;The risk of atherosclerosis increases with age, typically becoming more prevalent after 45 for men and 55 for women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history:&lt;/strong&gt; A strong family history of early heart disease or stroke indicates a genetic predisposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic inflammatory conditions: &lt;/strong&gt;Conditions like chronic kidney disease and certain autoimmune diseases can also heighten susceptibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Since this condition is asymptomatic in its early stages, it is vital to stay on top of your health and undergo regular tests. Dr Juneja recommended these tests, especially for those with multiple risk factors, a family history of heart diseases or for people over the age of 40:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Cholesterol panel (lipid profile), blood sugar, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure monitoring: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular checks are essential for identifying hypertension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):&lt;/strong&gt; A simple test comparing blood pressure in the ankle to that in the arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carotid ultrasound: &lt;/strong&gt;Visualises plaque buildup in the neck arteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score: &lt;/strong&gt;A CT scan measuring calcium deposits in heart arteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMT (Treadmill Test) / Stress Echo: &lt;/strong&gt;These tests assess heart function under stress to detect blockages in coronary arteries that might not be apparent at rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

She explains that certain foods are naturally cooling in nature and may increase mucus production, raising the likelihood of frequent colds in colder months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains, “Winter is here, but so are the sniffles! If you’re struggling with a cold, cough, or persistent congestion, your diet might be the culprit. While some foods are superfoods in the summer, they can actually cool your body down too much or increase mucus production during the colder months.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nutritionist outlines four foods that must be avoided during winters if you are prone to the sniffles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sattu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Khushi, sattu is a naturally cooling food, which is why it is traditionally considered ideal for consumption during the summer months. She explains, “Sattu is a summer superfood, not a winter one. It is naturally cooling, which is why it should be completely avoided in winters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fennel water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The nutritionist explains that fennel seeds are naturally cooling in nature and should therefore be avoided during winter, to reduce the risk of catching a cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;She states, “ The nature of fennel is naturally cold, so if you drink too much fennel water in the cold, it can increase your chances of catching a cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fruit and curd smoothies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khushi advises steering clear of cold fruit-and-curd smoothies, explaining that they can increase mucus production in the body and contribute to congestion. She highlights, “Fruit and curd combined can increase mucus production in your body, which can cause congestion and cold problems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coconut water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nutritionist warns against drinking coconut water in excess during winter, noting that its cooling effect can further lower the body’s internal warmth. She states, “Coconut water is naturally cooling for your body; therefore, avoid it or consume it in limited amounts during winters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A large Swedish &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported a lower risk of dementia among middle-aged and older adults who consumed higher amounts of full-fat cheese and cream. The findings may sound like welcome news but they need careful interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 27,670 participants for 25 years, during which 3,208 developed &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/dementia-283"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people without a known genetic risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, eating more than 50 grams of full-fat cheese per day was associated with a 13%–17% lower risk of Alzheimer's. No such reduction was seen among people who carried genetic risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-stalls-alzheimers-development-in-breakthrough-trial"&gt;New Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming more than 20 grams of full-fat cream per day was linked to a 16%–24% lower risk of dementia overall. No associations were found for low-fat or high-fat milk, fermented or non-fermented milk, or low-fat cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are notable given longstanding public &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/milk-and-dairy-nutrition/"&gt;health advice&lt;/a&gt; to choose low-fat dairy to reduce cardiovascular risk. This matters because heart disease and dementia share many risk factors, including high blood pressure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evidence from previous studies is combined, analyses suggest that cheese consumption may also be linked to a lower risk of heart disease, and that full-fat dairy does not necessarily increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other studies have explored whether similar patterns apply to brain health, but the results are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg" alt="Two young adults enjoying takeaway drinks on a bench outdoors" class="size-medium wp-image-186949" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;No need to add extra cream… (FatCamera/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043604/"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt; suggests that studies conducted in Asian populations are more likely to report benefits of dairy consumption for cognitive health, while many European studies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that average dairy intake tends to be much lower in Asian countries, meaning modest consumption may have different effects than higher intakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one Japanese study reported a reduced dementia risk among people who ate cheese, but overall consumption levels were very low and the research was sponsored by a cheese producer. In contrast, another &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335358/"&gt;Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; funded by government grants found no protective effect of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some long-term European studies have also reported benefits. In a Finnish &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-022-02834-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,497 middle-aged men followed for 22 years, cheese was the only food associated with a lower dementia risk, reduced by 28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of milk and processed red meat was linked to poorer performance on cognitive tests, while fish consumption was associated with better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;UK study&lt;/a&gt; following nearly 250,000 people found that eating fish two to four times a week, fruit daily and cheese once a week was associated with lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies have important limitations. What people eat is usually self-reported, and changes in memory can affect both eating habits and how accurately people remember what they have eaten. To deal with this, the Swedish researchers took two extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they excluded anyone who already had dementia when the study began. Then they repeated the same calculations after removing people who went on to develop dementia within the first ten years of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not mean starting the study again or recruiting new participants. It simply meant re-checking the results using a smaller group of people who remained dementia-free for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for doing this is that the early stages of dementia can subtly change behaviour long before diagnosis. People may eat differently, lose their appetite, or struggle to recall their usual diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on participants who stayed cognitively healthy for many years, the researchers reduced the chance that these early changes were influencing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important question is whether substitution played a role. Some of the apparent benefits may reflect replacing red or processed meat with cheese or cream, rather than an effect of dairy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this idea, the Swedish study found no association between full-fat dairy and dementia risk among participants whose diets remained stable over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, foods should not be considered in isolation. Dietary patterns matter more than individual ingredients. Diets such as the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is consistently associated with lower risks of both dementia and heart disease, include cheese alongside vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg" alt="Flatlay of various fresh healthy foods" class="size-medium wp-image-186951" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eating a healthy, varied diet can help protect brain health. (AlexRaths/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Swedish study, people who consumed more full-fat cheese and cream were also more educated, less likely to be overweight, and had lower rates of conditions linked to dementia, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes. All of these factors independently reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that higher cheese intake tended to occur within healthier overall lifestyles, rather than alongside excess calorie consumption or poor metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the evidence does not support the idea that full-fat dairy causes dementia, nor that fermented milk products reliably protect against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat cheese contains several nutrients relevant to brain health, including fat-soluble  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; A, D, and K2, as well as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B12, folate, iodine, zinc, and selenium. These nutrients play roles in neurological function and may help support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the data do not justify eating large amounts of cheese or cream as protective foods against dementia or heart disease. The most consistent message remains that balanced diets, moderation, and overall lifestyle matter far more than any single item on the cheese board.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272138/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eef-hogervorst-1283596"&gt;Eef Hogervorst&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Biological Psychology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/loughborough-university-1336"&gt;Loughborough University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacking before bed is fine—if you pick sleep-friendly foods like nuts, yogurt, oats, or tart cherries that curb hunger and support restful sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrients like fiber, magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin can boost sleep quality while keeping you satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and heavy or spicy foods at night, as they can disrupt sleep and digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s all too common to feel &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/stop-late-night-cravings-11836290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nagging hunger pangs&lt;/a&gt; in the hours between dinner and bedtime. Unfortunately, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/heart-healthy-snacks-for-late-night-cravings-11777163" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nighttime snacks and drinks&lt;/a&gt; often have a not-so-healthy reputation—it’s easy to reach for the most convenient (and crave-worthy) options after a day of making nutritious choices. While those late-night treats may be delicious, some can interfere with sleep quality and leave you feeling unsatisfied. That’s a frustrating double whammy, especially since good sleep is a cornerstone of overall health and wellness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Needing a snack before bed isn’t a problem—with the right choices, a nighttime snack can be both satisfying and nourishing. Here, experts share some delicious, healthy options that curb hunger and support restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-nutrients-for-healthy-nighttime-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Optimal Nutrients for Healthy Nighttime Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods with these nutrients aren’t just healthy for you, but also support a good night’s rest—so they’re perfect healthy night snacks. When midnight hunger comes knocking, reach for:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber supports optimal health&lt;/a&gt; by regulating the blood sugar response, lowering cholesterol levels, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;encouraging healthy digestion&lt;/a&gt;, increasing satiety after eating (ideal for evening snacks!), and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-11833113" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. A thriving gut microbiome supports the immune system, brain health, and several other body systems. And interestingly enough, a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/fo/d2fo01178f" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that fiber’s positive impact on the microbiome may be linked to better sleep by supporting the gut-brain axis and reducing symptoms of several sleep disorders. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Fiber is found largely in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; including fruits, veggies, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most common dietary supplements for those with sleep troubles is magnesium. “Magnesium, found in nuts, seeds, spinach, and tart cherry juice, may improve sleep quality so that you feel more rested and may help you fall asleep faster,” says Bianca Tamburello, RDN. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; on this key mineral supports these benefits. Though further research is warranted, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are undoubtedly healthy additions to your after-dinner snack, too, as they promote better bone, heart, and metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever elusive &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-get-more-vitamin-d-11807401" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D is essential&lt;/a&gt; for optimal immune, heart, metabolic, and bone health, but emerging research is also finding it to be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vitamins-for-better-sleep-8660402" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;super beneficial for sleep&lt;/a&gt;. This is thanks to a handful of proposed mechanisms, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s role in serotonin and melatonin production that are essential to healthy circadian rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D receptors on the brain stem that play an important role in sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s impact on certain pain disorders (like &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.994545/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;) that may negatively impact sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These impacts have been found in a multitude of studies, but are well summarized in this &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912284/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients. Some great dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, salmon, swordfish, tuna, sardines, beef liver, egg yolk, fortified orange juice, fortified dairy and plant milks, and fortified cereals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research shows that omega-3 supplementation &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2021/01/28/Study-says-omega-3-supplements-improve-sleep-in-people-with-low-fish-consumption" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;may improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; for those eating few omega-3 rich foods,” Tamburello says. This could be thanks to the fatty acid’s role in melatonin regulation. “Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foods high in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds, may improve sleep by promoting higher melatonin levels,” she adds. Plus, omega-3s promote heart, brain, and immune health, among many other impressive benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antioxidant-rich micronutrients like plant compounds, vitamin E, and vitamin C are also food additions to a bedtime snack. They help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, promoting overall health and immunity, while also aiding in pain alleviation that may interfere with quality shut-eye. Foods especially high in antioxidants include berries, citrus fruit, leafy greens, beets, nuts, seeds, and whole grains—though most plant-based foods contain at least some.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve all heard the common trope that the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/tryptophan-foods-6823810" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tryptophan found in turkey&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for the Thanksgiving nap many of us take after the big meal. And as it turns out, some of this may be true. “Tryptophan, which is often associated with turkey, but also found in dairy, chicken, and fish, can help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/mood-boosting-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;boost serotonin&lt;/a&gt; levels to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942088/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;positively impact sleep&lt;/a&gt;,” Tamburello explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Melatonin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the body to promote sleep, but can also be found as a supplement and in foods including tart cherry juice, walnuts, almonds, oats, and grapes,” Tamburello says. And there’s plenty of evidence to back this up, with research pointing to its role in improving symptoms of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36064286/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;, while also helping you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reach one of these healthy, sleep-promoting snacks if you're feeling hungry before bed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are packed with sleep-promoting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11695043" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, while both almonds and walnuts are filled with fiber, antioxidants, melatonin, and magnesium—plus a bit of plant protein, too. These nutritional perks will encourage overall health, satiety, and sleep. Plus, if you opt for lightly salted nuts, it can help to curb your salty cravings after dinner.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The satisfying sweetness of a smoothie bowl is perfect after dinner. Smoothies are also an ideal vehicle for sleep-inducing additions like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/tart-cherry-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tart cherries&lt;/a&gt; (or tart cherry juice), frozen berries, grapes, and even oats.

This is due to its omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Salmon from Chile is especially beneficial in this regard as it is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25108414/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;particularly high&lt;/a&gt; in omega-3s. Smoked salmon is nothing short of a *chef’s kiss* when served on whole wheat crackers with a swipe of cream cheese and a sprinkle of fresh dill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats can save the day at night—not just at breakfast time. They contain omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, magnesium, fiber, and antioxidants found in ingredients like oats and chia seeds. Top with berries and a splash of milk to help with those sugar cravings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The tryptophan found in turkey (and chicken!) will help you have a more complete night’s sleep, making turkey roll-ups the perfect slightly salty nighttime snack.

High-fiber popcorn and protein-filled edamame are excellent choices, but don’t sleep on fresh-cut veggies and a satisfying dip. Dip them in vitamin D and tryptophan-rich cottage cheese to promote sleep and add an irresistibly savory bite. I top my cottage cheese with everything bagel seasoning for extra flavor. If you’re really not a cottage cheese fan, hummus, yogurt dip, or guacamole are delicious, savory, filling options too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you need something truly zero-fuss—just a light, airy, crunchy bite—reach for a few handfuls of plain or lightly salted popcorn. This snack is technically a whole grain that'll provide a bit more fiber than other late-night, bagged snacks like potato chips or pretzels. Try a pre-bagged option from the grocery store that's easy on the sodium levels, made with little to no oils, and doesn't have any or much added sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, cheese one of the simplest—and most delicious—ways to induce sleep when you're snacking before bed. Cheese contains tryptophan&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an amino acid that carries sleep-regulating properties. Additionally, the calcium found in cheese mixes with tryptophan to produce melatonin—the sleep-inducing hormone. Seriously, think about all those times you felt a bit lethargic after eating from a cheese board; you weren't just imagining it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you happen to be up late and your stomach's aching for a snack, consider whipping up an egg or two to satiate you (and lull you to sleep). Plus, it's a relatively easy meal to make when you're short on time and energy!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other side of the coin, there are certain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-you-should-never-eat-before-bed-11684466" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods you should avoid before bed&lt;/a&gt; because they can disrupt nightly sleep or leave us still-hungry and lacking satisfying nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol, high-sugar products, ultra-processed foods: &lt;/strong&gt;These include alcohol, ultra-processed foods, and added sugars. As pro-inflammatory agents, these foods can hurt sleep quality, potentially causing stomach upset, interfering with normal sleep patterns (as is the case with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/3/1/zpac023/6632721" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mana.md/sugar-and-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;), or promoting spikes in energy, which added sugar tends to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/should-you-drink-coffee-before-bed-7255700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Caffeine-rich drinks&lt;/a&gt; and foods—certain teas, coffee, energy drinks, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-caffeine-in-chocolate-8383422" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;—should also be approached with caution post-dinner, as caffeine is a stimulant that promotes stamina and wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicy foods and high-saturated fat foods: &lt;/strong&gt;“Additionally, spicy foods and hard-to-digest high-fat foods can cause acid reflux if eaten too close to bedtime, interfering with healthy sleep patterns” Tamburello adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-more-healthy-nighttime-snacking-tips-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; More Healthy Nighttime Snacking Tips and Considerations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you feel that you’re ravenous soon after dinner, it’s possible that you’re restricting too much,” Tamburello says. “For maximum nutrition and filling power, aim to make half your plate a fiber-rich veggie, a quarter of your plate a lean protein, and a quarter of your plate a whole grain or complex carbohydrate.” This winning combination of nutrients should &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/most-satiating-foods-8424198" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leave you feeling satisfied&lt;/a&gt; well after you’ve finished your meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/why-am-i-craving-sugar" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar cravings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/why-do-i-crave-salt" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;salt cravings&lt;/a&gt; hit you at night, it’s important to look at the whole picture of your daily life—these cravings can be brought on by stress, habitually consuming higher amounts of these foods regularly, dehydration, and (ironically) poor sleep habits. The healthy snacks highlighted above should help to curb some of these cravings, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/mindfulness-activities-7555756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;practicing mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial, too. The practice of mindfulness helps us tune into our bodies to determine whether we’re actually hungry, experiencing an empty craving, snacking out of a behavioral habit, or actually have another need, like drinking more water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-best-time-for-a-nightly-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What’s the Best Time for a Nightly Snack? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of when the best time for a nighttime snack is, “some research suggests that eating &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9092657/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;four to six hours&lt;/a&gt; before bed is best to prevent digestion from interfering with sleep, while &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/is-it-bad-to-eat-before-bed" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;other experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; eating up to 2 hours before bed,” Tamburello says. In other words, there are several schools of thought, and it really depends on you, your appetite, and other contextual factors. “The bottom line: If you’re hungry, you should eat something,” she says.

Background: The Oregon intersection where Carl Wescott fell into a construction trench and suffered fatal injuries (Google Maps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 73-year-old military veteran in &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/tag/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; who was on his way home from a store in his motorized wheelchair fell into a construction trench and suffered fatal injuries, leading his family to file a &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/tag/wrongful-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrongful death&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit that was settled this month. The family had sued the state of Oregon and county contractors, claiming the man was told he could cross through the construction site by local workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Wescott, of Sweet Home, suffered an open ankle fracture-dislocation, left upper arm bone fracture, left fibula fracture, and damage to his muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves and soft tissues of his head, neck, shoulders, back, hips and legs after falling into the trench in 2022, according to the &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/tag/lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which was obtained by the &lt;a href="https://democratherald.com/news/local/crime-courts/article_fea6692f-1114-465d-8ca9-c33073ee2595.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Albany Democrat-Herald&lt;/a&gt; and its sister publication, the &lt;a href="https://gazettetimes.com/news/local/crime-courts/article_aeca1633-99c7-5b3b-81ca-40bfc34161d2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Corvallis Gazette-Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Carl Wescott spent his final days in a hospital bed," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wescott, who died two weeks after the fall, was already suffering from kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and diabetes before his hospitalization, his family alleged. He was attempting to cross at an intersection in Sweet Home at 18th Avenue and Main Street, when he encountered a construction area that was set up by Lane County contractors, identified in the complaint as Wildish Construction of Eugene, C-2 Utility Contractors of Coburg and Lantz Electric of Eugene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to his family, Wescott was allowed to cross through the site on his way to a local store and then again on his way back. An employee of C-2 Utility allegedly moved a backhoe to let him pass through the closed intersection. The contractor denied responsibility for Wescott's death, claiming in court docs that he was negligent and ultimately to blame for his own injuries, the Democrat-Herald and Gazette-Times report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lantz Electric also denied responsibility and reportedly said it was Wescott's fault that he died. The company claimed in court docs that Wescott was told not to reenter the construction zone and to instead find an alternate route that would allow him to pass safely. State officials also claimed Wescott was responsible for what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/lawsuit/dental-patient-suffered-fatal-brain-injury-during-implant-procedure-after-snapping-photo-in-chair-saying-fun-never-stops-family-secures-legal-settlement-lawyers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from Law&amp;amp;Crime: Dental patient suffered fatal brain injury during implant procedure after snapping photo in chair saying 'fun never stops' — family secures legal settlement: Lawyers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had a trial date set for May 2026 before it was settled this month. A Linn County court dismissed the case on Dec. 19, according to online court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. Wescott's family had been seeking $2.35 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
