&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the county on the northern border of Stevens, Grant County, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0uJqqfNbQYF3UD23EAQ7Q9P6Wc6GkviiwrfakYuVguwSTy34HzPUmNbLdH4dCMB6Jl&amp;amp;id=100068906386981"&gt;also reported three confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, which were also linked to the first case in Stevens. Grant County is in a much better position to handle the outbreak than its neighbors; its one school district, Ulysses, reported 100 percent vaccination coverage for kindergartners in the 2023–2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outbreak risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, details about the fast-rising cases are scant. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has not published another press release about the cases since March 13. Ars Technica reached out to KDHE for more information but did not hear back before this story's publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlet &lt;a href="https://www.kwch.com/2025/03/20/6-measles-cases-reported-kansas-according-kdhe/"&gt;KWCH 12 News out of Wichita published a story Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, when there were just six cases reported in just Grant and Stevens Counties, saying that all six were in unvaccinated people and that no one had been hospitalized. On Friday, KWCH updated the story to note that the case count had increased to 10 and that the health department now considers the situation an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Measles is an extremely infectious virus&lt;/a&gt; that can linger &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;in airspace and on surfaces for up to two hours&lt;/a&gt; after an infected person has been in an area. Among unvaccinated people exposed to the virus, 90 percent will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have slipped nationwide, creating pockets that have lost herd immunity and are vulnerable to fast-spreading, difficult-to-stop outbreaks. In the past, strong vaccination rates prevented such spread, and in 2000, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;the virus was declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there was no continuous spread of the virus over a 12-month period. Experts now fear that the US will lose its elimination status, meaning measles will once again be considered endemic to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented 378 measles cases as of Thursday, March 20. That figure is already out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported 309 cases in its ongoing outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. Forty people have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child with no underlying medical conditions has died. The outbreak has spilled over to New Mexico and Oklahoma. In New Mexico, officials reported Friday that the case count has risen to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;42 cases&lt;/a&gt;, with two hospitalizations and one death in an unvaccinated adult. In Oklahoma, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;the case count stands at four&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Last Friday was World Sleep Day. Did you miss it? If so, that feels apt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of us feel stuck trying to catch up and sleep better. We've all been told not to look at a screen before bedtime because the light disrupts sleep, right? Surprisingly, researchers have found that the light from screens delayed people's sleep by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blue-light-smartphone-screen-sleep/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a max of 10 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But even if your device's bright light doesn't have a huge effect, spending your day on a computer won't prepare your body for a good night's sleep. One of the surest methods to make sure you can fall asleep faster and stay asleep?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed it: get enough movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A scoping review of sleep research just published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44323-024-00018-w" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites a &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.2930" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found this:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female adults with insomnia who commit to at least half an hour of daily exercise gain 15 additional minutes of sleep compared with those who do not exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As a female adult who has experienced some sleepless nights, I've been tracking my steps for years and my movement-to-sleep ratio has become clear:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less than 10,000 = oof, it's gonna be hard to fall asleep10,000 = decent night's sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12,000 = solid night's sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16,000 and up = I better stretch or my aching back might keep me up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Do you have a magic number?&lt;/p&gt;

This research suggests that targeting the meningeal lymphatics—vessels outside the brain—could be a novel approach to treating age-related cognitive decline without directly crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment reduced levels of the inflammatory protein IL-6 and restored healthy neuronal signaling, alleviating memory loss in older mice. These findings open the door to therapies that enhance brain function by supporting the body’s natural “waste management” system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Clearance Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing meningeal lymphatic drainage improved memory in aged mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatment reduced IL-6 levels, restoring healthy brain communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting lymphatic vessels outside the brain could offer non-invasive options for age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As aging bodies decline, the brain loses the ability to cleanse itself of waste, a scenario that scientists think could be contributing to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, among others. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report they have found a way around that problem by targeting the network of vessels that drain waste from the brain. Rejuvenating those vessels, they have shown, improves memory in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108225"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;He found that the older mice with rejuvenated lymphatic vessels spent more time with the new object – an indicator of improved memory – compared with the older mice not given the treatment. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published online March 21 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, lays the groundwork to develop therapies for age-related cognitive decline that overcome the challenges faced by conventional medications that struggle to pass through the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The physical blood-brain barrier hinders the efficacy of therapies for neurological disorders,” said Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Pathology &amp;amp; Immunology and a BJC Investigator at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Waste removal improves memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kipnis is an expert in the blossoming field of neuroimmunology, the study of how the immune system affects the brain in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Kipnis’ lab discovered a network of vessels surrounding the brain — known as the meningeal lymphatics — in mice and humans that drains fluid and waste into the lymph nodes, where many immune system cells reside and monitor for signs of infection, disease or injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and colleagues also have shown that some investigational Alzheimer’s therapies are more effective in mice when paired with a treatment that improves drainage of fluid and debris from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning at about age 50, people start to experience a decline in brain fluid flow as part of normal aging. For the new study, Kipnis collaborated with Marco Colonna, MD, the Robert Rock Belliveau, MD, Professor of Pathology, and asked if enhancing the function of an old drainage system can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the memory of mice, the researchers placed two identical black rods in the cage for twenty minutes for old mice to explore. The next day, the mice received one of the black rods again and a new object, a silver rectangular prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice that remember playing with the black rod will spend more time with the new object. But old mice spend a similar amount of time playing with both objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first author of the new study, Kyungdeok Kim, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Kipnis lab, boosted functioning of the lymphatic vessels in old mice with a treatment that stimulates vessel growth, enabling more waste to drain out of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found that the older mice with rejuvenated lymphatic vessels spent more time with the new object – an indicator of improved memory – compared with the older mice not given the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A functioning lymphatic system is critical for brain health and memory,” said Kim. “Therapies that support the health of the body’s waste management system may have health benefits for a naturally aging brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain’s overwhelmed cleaning crew&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the lymphatic system is so impaired that waste builds up in the brain, the burden of cleaning falls to the brain’s resident immune cells, called microglia. But this local cleaning crew fails to keep up with the mess and gets exhausted, Kipnis explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that the overwhelmed cells produce a distress signal, an immune protein called interleukin 6, or IL-6, that acts on brain cells to promote cognitive decline in mice with damaged lymphatic vessels. Examining the brains of such mice, the researchers found that neurons had an imbalance in the types of signals they receive from surrounding brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, neurons received fewer signals that function like noise-canceling headphones among the cacophony of neuron communications. This imbalance, caused by increased IL-6 levels in the brain, led to changes in how the brain is wired and affected proper brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to improving memory in the aged mice, the lymphatic vessel-boosting treatment also caused levels of IL-6 to drop, restoring the noise-canceling system of the brain. The findings point to the potential of improving the health of the brain’s lymphatic vessels to preserve or restore cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we mark the 10th anniversary of our discovery of the brain’s lymphatic system, these new findings provide insight into the importance of this system for brain health,” said Kipnis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting the more easily accessible lymphatic vessels that are located outside the brain may prove to be an exciting new frontier in the treatment of brain disorders. We may not be able to revive neurons, but we may be able to ensure their most optimal functioning through modulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim K, Abramishvili D, Du S, Papadopoulos Z, Cao J, Herz J, Smirnov I, Thomas JL, Colonna M, Kipnis J.

          &lt;p&gt;For many of us, memories of our childhood have become a bit hazy, if not vanishing entirely. But nobody really remembers much before the age of 4, because nearly all humans experience what's termed "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia"&gt;infantile amnesia&lt;/a&gt;," in which memories that might have formed before that age seemingly vanish as we move through adolescence. And it's not just us; the phenomenon appears to occur in a number of our fellow mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest explanation for this would be that the systems that form long-term memories are simply immature and don't start working effectively until children hit the age of 4. But a recent animal experiment suggests that the situation in mice is more complex: the memories are there, they're just not normally accessible, although they can be re-activated. Now, a study that put human infants in an MRI tube suggests that memory activity starts by the age of 1, suggesting that the results in mice may apply to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less than total recall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice are one of the species that we know experience infantile amnesia. And, thanks to over a century of research on mice, we have some sophisticated genetic tools that allow us to explore what's actually involved in the apparent absence of the animals' earliest memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9921"&gt;paper that came out last year&lt;/a&gt; describes a series of experiments that start by having very young mice learn to associate seeing a light come on with receiving a mild shock. If nothing else is done with those mice, that association will apparently be forgotten later in life due to infantile amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, the researchers could do something. Neural activity normally results in the activation of a set of genes. In these mice, the researchers engineered it so one of the genes that gets activated encodes a protein that can modify DNA. When this protein is made, it results in permanent changes to a second gene that was inserted in the animal's DNA. Once activated through this process, the gene leads to the production of a light-activated ion channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While just 49 people with MS received the device, the researchers nonetheless noted that this was, to their knowledge, the largest study of its kind involving MS patients, with follow-up of slightly longer than six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, SNM was found to have “sustained efficacy” in easing bladder dysfunction in 51% of the MS patients in the study, with “just over half of patients … [continuing] to perceive benefit from their therapy over an average follow-up duration of just over 6 years,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772973725000074#sec5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sacral neuromodulation outcomes in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms in multiple sclerosis patients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Continence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;As many as 4 of every 5 MS patients experience bladder dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 4 of every 5 people with MS experience some form of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/urinary-incontinence-ms/"&gt;bladder dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, also called LUTS, for lower urinary tract symptoms. Common issues due to LUTS range from an overactive bladder, or the need to urinate very frequently or urgently, and an inability to hold in urine, known as incontinence, to trouble starting urination, and incomplete emptying of the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS-related bladder problems can be managed with medications and other treatments, such as physical therapy to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder, bowel, and uterus in women. Lifestyle changes related to diet or fluid intake may also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNM, also called sacral nerve stimulation, is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which a device implanted in the body delivers mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerves. These nerves extend from the base of the spinal cord through the sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine, into various parts of the lower body, including the bladder and bowels. In many patients, SNM has been shown to be effective in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359216/"&gt;managing bowel incontinence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little has been detailed, however, about the success of SNM in managing bladder dysfunction in people with MS. To learn more, a team led by U.S. researchers reviewed the medical records of 58 MS patients who sought to undergo the procedure between 2013 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 51, or nearly 90%, of the patients were women. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;Relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; was the most common &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;MS type&lt;/a&gt;, seen for 66%, followed by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;, diagnosed for 17%. The most common indication for SNM was urinary urgency and frequency, affecting 69%. Nonobstructive urinary retention — when the bladder can’t empty despite no physical blockage in the urinary tract — was seen for the remaining 31%. The mean follow-up was 6.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients (71%) also underwent urodynamic testing, which assesses the function of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine. The most prevalent finding was an overactive or underactive bladder muscle, called the detrusor muscle. Detrusor sphincter dysynergia, the lack of coordination between the bladder muscle and the urethral sphincter during urination, was also found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sacral neuromodulation indicated for patients with certain urinary problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients underwent preliminary testing to assess whether they might benefit from permanently implanting a pulse generator (IPG), the device that delivers electrical pulses in SNM. This included peripheral nerve evaluation, in which a thin wire was temporarily placed near the sacral nerves, or the placement of a single permanent wire. Patients were eligible for permanent IPG placement if the preliminary testing reduced urinary dysfunction by at least 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 49 of the 58 patients (85%) progressed from the preliminary testing phase to IPG implantation, which occurred at a higher rate among those with urinary urgency and frequency than urinary retention (95% vs. 61%). The implantation rate was 56% for patients with detrusor underactivity and 100% for detrusor sphincter dysynergia, but it was similar regardless of preliminary testing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with nonobstructive urinary retention were less likely to receive the IPG implant, while those with a higher body mass index, or body fat content based on height and weight, were more likely to do so. No relationship was identified between IPG implant rates and MS type, urodynamic data, medication use, or prior catheter use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;SNM [sacral neuromodulation] is an effective treatment option for LUTS [lower urinary tract symptoms] associated with MS, … [though] many patients will experience declining efficacy as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 49 patients who received the IPG implant, SNM continued to be effective in easing bladder dysfunction in half (51%), while the other half reported decreased efficacy over time, the data showed. Still, no factors were found to predict sustained efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that “this patient cohort represents the largest [group] of MS patients undergoing SNM therapy to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the team concluded that “SNM is an effective treatment option for LUTS associated with MS,” though they noted that “many patients will experience declining efficacy as time progresses regardless of indication for implantation.”&lt;/p&gt;

McCully, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School in the 1960s and ’70s whose colleagues banished him to the basement for insisting — correctly, it turned out — that homocysteine, an amino acid, was being overlooked as a possible risk factor for heart disease, died on Feb. 21 at his home in Winchester, Mass. He was 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;His daughter, Martha McCully, said the cause was metastatic prostate cancer. His death was not widely reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still a debated idea today, Dr. McCully’s theory — that inadequate intake of certain B vitamins causes high levels of homocysteine in the blood, hardening the arteries with plaque — challenged the cholesterol-focused paradigm backed by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. McCully didn’t think cholesterol should be ignored, but he thought it was malpractice to disregard the significance of homocysteine. His bosses at Harvard disagreed. First, they moved his lab below ground; then they told him to leave. He struggled to find work for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It was very traumatic,” he &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/04/science/new-clue-to-heart-disease-a-vitamin-lack.html" title=""&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times medical reporter &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" title=""&gt;Gina Kolata&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. “People don’t believe you.

has long been considered the easiest way out, it's not always as peaceful as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Death during sleep could be from a variety of causes, including heart failure, sleep apnea, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-b45c1c30-066e-11f0-a41c-51a55c445061"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and respiratory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many of these conditions cause patients to slowly drift off, others may leave the person gasping for breath, clutching their chest, or choking in their final moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13891031/death-expert-doctors-preferred-die.html"&gt;most painless ways to go&lt;/a&gt; might also be one of the most brutal: some experts think imploding would happen so quick you wouldn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And do you remember how you felt as you drifted off under anesthesia the last time you had surgery? Probably not - but that's exactly the point. Overdosing on sedatives has also been touted as one of the more peaceful methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Implosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is the Titan submersible that imploded in 2023. Experts believe the passengers all died peacefully and had no idea what was going to happen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's an unlikely cause of death, but experts believe a violent implosion would kill in milliseconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was believed to have been the case of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12223805/Debris-field-discovered-search-area-near-Titanic.html"&gt;five tragic passengers aboard the Titan submersible&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, which imploded during a deep-sea mission to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an implosion, an object collapses in on itself in just a matter of milliseconds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dale Molé, the former director of undersea medicine and radiation health for the US Navy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12224667/Exactly-happened-Titanic-fives-final-moments-revealed-former-Navy-doctor.html"&gt;told DailyMail.com at the time&lt;/a&gt; that an implosion 'is when the wave of pressure is inward, whereas an explosion is when the pressure wave or the shock wave goes out from whatever the source of that is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He compared an explosion to blowing up a balloon too much - the balloon will eventually pop when there is too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an implosion, the opposite occurs, when there is more outward pressure than the container can understand, then the insides collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Molé said the Titan passengers' deaths would have been quick and painless, dying almost instantly by the extraordinary forces exerted by the ocean at depth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It would have been so sudden, that they wouldn't even have known that there was a problem, or what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The USS Thresher, which imploded in 1963, is pictured above. The 129 sailors and civilians on board were believed to have died immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like being here one minute, and then the switch is turned off. You're alive one millisecond, and the next millisecond you're dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the Titan disaster, a similar catastrophe occurred in 1963 when the USS Thresher, a nuclear-powered submarine, most likely imploded when it exceeded 'test depth' and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8765875/Navy-releases-documents-Cold-War-loss-submarine.html"&gt;suffered a series of other failures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 129 sailors and civilians on board were believed to have died immediately.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear how many Americans have died by implosion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Anesthesia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the odds dying while under anesthesia are low, it would be painless (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anesthesia is generally considered safe, helping nearly 40million Americans stay asleep during lifesaving operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in rare cases, the medicine can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Society of Anesthesiologists suggests anywhere from one in 100,000 to one in 200,000 patients die from anesthesia every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For healthy patients receiving routine procedures like colonoscopies and hip replacement, that risk is as low as one in 1million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this rate rises slightly from one in 100,000 for people with chronic health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anesthesia can cause the airway muscles to relax, which may block the airway and cause breathing issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may also result in low oxygen levels and excess carbon dioxide, which leads to brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low blood pressure and heart rate may also occur, which can cause heart attacks or strokes in patients with underlying conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in the rare instance of anesthesia-related death, the medicine would keep patients from feeling anything or being aware of the complications. This would make death painless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest usually kills in four to six minutes and is painless once patients fall unconscious (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the most common causes of deaths, killing 356,000 Americans every year. This is roughly 1,000 people every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12938535/Most-people-suffering-cardiac-arrest-home-dont-survive-data-suggests.html"&gt;nine in 10 don't survive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when heart activity stops without warning due to a disruption in the heart's natural rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is different from a heart attack, which is caused by a clogged artery blocking blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiac arrest kills in four to six minutes, while a heart attack can last several hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, light-headedness and weakness start suddenly and only occur for a few minutes before patients faint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once patients go unconscious, cardiac arrest is painless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-c60d8fd0-0660-11f0-a41c-51a55c445061"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates 60 percent of cardiac arrest patients are men, and a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.ohiohealth.com/men-face-greater-risk-of-cardiac-arrest-study/#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20tends%20to%20develop,the%20same%20age%2C%20researchers%20report."&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that while one in nine men will suffer a cardiac arrest before age 70, only one in 30 women will have one.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart conditions like coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy - an enlarged heart - and heart valve disease can all increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, as they increase the risk of rhythm problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Kidney disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hospice nurse Julie McFadden said once kidney failure patients stop dialysis, their decline only takes seven to 10 days (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-1df74f20-2989-11ef-b2f9-157609981e08" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, called end-stage kidney disease one of the most 'peaceful' ways to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic kidney failure, occurs when another disease damages the organs and leaves them unable to properly filter out waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include diabetes, high blood pressure, urinary obstructions, and recurrent infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When kidney disease progresses, the best treatment is a kidney transplant, though many patients wait on a transplant list for years, often becoming too sick for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, patients undergo dialysis, which involves a machine removing waste from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this process can be time consuming and cause uncomfortable side effects like muscle cramps, low blood pressure, dizziness, and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms McFadden said in recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ysgysc4eN4"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span&gt;'End-stage kidney disease is a life-limiting chronic illness that is very hard to have because it's so long term.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'[It's] still difficult to have, but dying from end-stage kidney disease is definitely one of the most peaceful ways to die that I've seen.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;McFadden explained once patients stop dialysis, their decline typically only takes seven to 10 days.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that time, it's unlikely they will be in any pain, as they will sleep the majority of the time due to lethargy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As toxins build up in the body after stopping dialysis, patients may experience itching, but 'they're so tired and sleeping all the time that they don't notice the itching,' McFadden said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She called end-stage kidney disease the closest thing to dying in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You slowly fall asleep until you die,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, about 58,000 Americans died from kidney disease, making it the ninth leading cause of death in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across North America, deer and elk are increasingly suffering from a devastating illness. They stumble, drool, and appear visibly emaciated. They lose their fear of humans, staring blankly as if their senses have abandoned them. This grim affliction, known colloquially as “zombie deer disease,” has experts deeply concerned — not just for wildlife, but potentially for human health as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officially termed chronic wasting disease (CWD), the condition is neither a virus nor a bacterium. It’s but a prion disease; and if you’re not &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/prion-disease-02092015/"&gt;terrified of prions&lt;/a&gt;, you probably don’t know enough about them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-ticking-time-bomb"&gt;A ticking time bomb&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/health/diseases-and-conditions/prions-the-charismatic-proteins/"&gt;Prions are infectious proteins&lt;/a&gt; that cause the body’s normal proteins to misfold, leading to severe neurological damage and eventual death. Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), can affect both animals and humans. In humans, these diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which often appears spontaneously without a known cause, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which emerged during the “mad cow disease” epidemic when people consumed contaminated beef.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, prion diseases remain incurable and fatal. We have no idea how to fight back against them. Their unique biology poses enormous challenges for public health officials and scientists. This also makes it hard to assess the risk of them jumping to other species, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, since CWD is spreading, researchers are understandably worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First identified in captive mule deer in Colorado in 1967, CWD has silently spread among deer, elk, and moose populations across North America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the disease may be reaching a dangerous critical point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What began quietly over half a century ago has now exploded into a full-blown wildlife epidemic. By early 2025, the disease had been documented in wild and domestic herds across 36 U.S. states and several Canadian provinces. This spread to faraway places like Finland, Norway, and Sweden, and even in farmed animals in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852723/"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. In some places, infection rates among local deer populations are staggering. In southern Saskatchewan, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-bse-hunting-1.6270051"&gt;nearly 80%&lt;/a&gt; of male mule deer now carry CWD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why this disease is spreading&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that prions are remarkably durable. They’re not living entities, so they don’t really need to do anything to endure. Shed through bodily fluids — saliva, urine, feces — these prions persist in soils for years. They contaminate plants and &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1947" href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/natural-sciences/physics-articles/matter-and-energy/the-real-color-of-water-blue/"&gt;water sources&lt;/a&gt;, creating invisible reservoirs of infection. Wildlife officials struggle to manage the disease, particularly as animals congregate at artificial feeding sites established by humans, which makes it easier to pass the disease from one animal to another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, where elk gather by the thousands at winter feedgrounds, warnings from scientists like conservationist Lloyd Dorsey have gone unheeded. “Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding,” he says. Now, experts fear, the situation has reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/20/chronic-wasting-disease-spread-zombie-deer-global-us-aoe"&gt;critical point&lt;/a&gt; and places like Wyoming have set up a perfect storm that can allow CWD to explode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As infected deer roam further and wider, hunters across the United States unknowingly harvest infected animals, consuming the contaminated venison and sharing it with their communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises hunters to test deer from infected areas, but compliance remains low. Simply put, hunters don’t seem to listen to the warnings. To make matters even worse, CDC “disease detectors” were among the first to be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/cdc-disease-detectors-fired-trump-administration-agency-cuts-doge-rcna192420"&gt;fired by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-humans-be-next"&gt;Could humans be next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No confirmed cases of humans contracting CWD have yet been documented, but it’s a looming threat. The more we let diseases like this roam free, the more we risk an unwanted jump to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a chilling report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota warned of an impending global crisis if CWD were to spill over to humans. Authored by a panel of 67 leading scientists and health experts, the report concludes the United States — and indeed the world — is woefully unprepared for such an event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite this, no contingency plans exist at a national or international level to address the possibility of spillover, which would trigger a national and global crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report essentially piles on one bit of bad news after another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Currently, CWD management is in the domain of wildlife agencies. With no vaccine or treatment available, CWD management focuses on mitigating disease spread. Thus, CWD is likely to become endemic in more areas over time as the agent is introduced to new areas where cervids are present. Because cervids are widespread on every continent except Antarctica, CWD poses a significant global threat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source data-srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.webp 1176w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="" class="wp-image-280093 sp-no-webp perfmatters-lazy" alt="CWD prion protein structure" decoding="async" data-src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png" data-srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png 1176w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-280093 sp-no-webp" alt="CWD prion protein structure" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;3D structure of major prion protein. Image via Wiki Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate concern is the disease jumping to a farm animal species. If that were to happen, we don’t even have a way to detect the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No single test can identify CWD transmission to a non-cervid species, clearly presenting a major diagnostic challenge. In theory, a combination of existing tests could be used, but data are not available on whether they could differentiate BSE or scrapie from CWD in&lt;br&gt;a novel animal host.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents for prion spillover do exist. In the 1980s and 1990s, the United Kingdom &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy"&gt;witnessed mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt; (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) jump to humans through contaminated beef, resulting in the fatal variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a risk of CWD spillover to other wildlife, non-cervid production animals, and humans. The risk of CWD spillover is not static and may be increasing as new strains emerge and exposure probabilities increase.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a pressing need to better understand evolving CWD prion strain characteristics and associated spillover risk,” the CIDRAP report concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-urgently-need-to-be-prepared"&gt;We urgently need to be prepared&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing some concerning human cases. Two hunters in Texas who frequently consumed deer meat from a CWD-infected region died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). And, while a direct link to CWD &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240219-zombie-deer-disease-risks-for-humans"&gt;wasn’t proven&lt;/a&gt;, this is a plausible connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Physician recognition of prion diseases is limited because these illnesses are rare and have symptoms that overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases,” CIDRAP experts wrote. They recommend expanding surveillance programs, enhancing physician awareness, and establishing clear public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amira Roess, an epidemiologist at George Mason University, underscores the importance of caution, &lt;a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2024-03/should-you-be-worried-about-zombie-deer"&gt;especially among hunters&lt;/a&gt;. “Fortunately, the risk of prion disease from deer appears low if humans limit their contact with deer, especially their blood and nervous tissue. But this means that we must be very careful and vigilant,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree there’s still a window of opportunity to prevent a human outbreak, but time is running short. Better coordination between wildlife management, public health agencies, and scientists is urgently needed. CIDRAP’s extensive report calls for immediate action: comprehensive surveillance, sustained research, and rigorous public outreach to educate hunters and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just two of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the 307 sick patients being unvaccinated or having an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some 378 cases in the U.S. so far this year, according to a Friday update from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the 285 measles cases recorded in the entirety of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, which has the second-highest number of measles cases in the country, Lea County is home to 40 of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="42 confirmed measles cases"&gt;42 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt;, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The spread of measles recently increased in Kansas, where the state’s &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" aria-label="health department"&gt;health department&lt;/a&gt; has reported 10 cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 211 measles cases located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (37), Dawson County (13), Yoakum County (12), Dallam County (6), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (8), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2). Measles cases not associated with the larger outbreak in West Texas include cases in Harris County (3), Lamar County (2), Midland County (1), Rockwall County (1) and Travis County (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 130 of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 102 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 58 were reported among adults aged 18 and above. The ages of 19 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="38 cases"&gt;38 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, 36 of which are in Lea County, an area on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Washington, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vermont, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. Health officials from Oklahoma, which is not marked on the CDC’s measles tracker, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; four “probable” cases of measles as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus and can appear as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces and linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after infected people leave a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Is The Isolation Protocol For Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles should isolate for four days after they develop a rash, with the day of rash onset being considered day zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

She had a tennis ball-sized tumor in her chest that her OB/GYN had brushed off as a benign cyst months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were other signs, in hindsight, that she and her doctor had missed, such as changes in the color and texture of her breasts, small lumps in her armpit and near her collarbone, intense abdominal pain, and nipple discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart said her symptoms also included 'extreme &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-c1730b00-065e-11f0-8539-952ebe8d4a1f"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; without trying, sleeping 13 hours a day, and never being able to recover from a common cold.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her last option, after all of the cancer drugs she tried failed, was Enhertu, a targeted chemotherapy drug that finds cancer cells, delivers medication directly to them, shrinks tumors, and minimizes harm to healthy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14322495/cancer-vaccine-donald-trump-mrna-cure-tumors.html"&gt;experimental medicine&lt;/a&gt; has worked better than expected, getting rid of her pain, reducing the cancer that had spread to her lungs, reduced swelling of her liver, and signs of tumor growth have reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, feeling &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14322495/cancer-vaccine-donald-trump-mrna-cure-tumors.html"&gt;stronger than ever&lt;/a&gt; following her first year of treatment, she began making plans to travel with her eight-year-old son, including hiking through the jungles of Belize and Kauai.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those moments are when I feel most alive – being able to crawl through cave systems with him when just a couple of years ago I was told I had less than a year to live,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nicola Heart thought that nothing could be more difficult than holding her newborn babies as they died, but in 2020, at age 37, she faced an even greater challenge when she was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her symptoms included nipple discharge, a sudden change in breast size, a lump in her armpit, skin texture changes such as dimpling, unexplained extreme weight loss, sleeping 13 hours a day, and an inability to recover from a common cold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I went from being put on hospice to where I am today – able to do most of the things I want to do and not be in pain.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around half of breast cancer patients are over 60, and the disease is generally one that is more likely to strike older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Heart is trying to disabuse women of that, noting that it is possible for a relatively young, healthy woman to be stricken by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘This is all new to me. It gets dark, not going to lie. But I keep reminding myself that I’m going to get through this, and things will start looking up soon.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart, from Dana Point, California, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of around 31 percent. The disease had already spread aggressively to her bones, liver, and lungs, causing excruciating pain and severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, her condition was so dire that she was advised to seek hospice care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I’ve been trying to navigate the fact that I have arrived at my last line of treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her decline is slowing and her condition appears to be improving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has preserved her hair for years using Penguin Cold Caps, which reduce blood flow to the scalp, limiting chemotherapy exposure and protecting hair follicles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she has reached the very last medical option – new treatment Enhertu started three months ago – her pain has gone away, the metastases in her lungs have disappeared, her liver is shrinking again, and her tumor markers are coming down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Enhertu works like a targeted missile, finding cancer cells, delivering a powerful drug directly to them, and helping shrink tumors while minimizing damage to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart now feels able to spend more quality time with her son, something she struggled to do while she was undergoing a range of procedures, including a port placement, liver biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy, while also receiving countless blood transfusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, her blood counts were so low that she couldn't start her chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve been in and out of the hospital, dealing with transfusion fevers and unbearable pain,’ she said. ‘It’s been a whirlwind. I don’t even remember a lot of it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The last few weeks have been extremely tough – dealing with chemo side effects and cancer pain. On top of that, it looks like I will lose my hair. I’m pissed. Losing my hair this late in the game feels really shitty. I don’t want my son to remember me without hair,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has maintained her hair for years using Penguin Cold Caps, a scalp-cooling process that temporarily decreases blood flow to that area, limiting the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach them, thereby protecting hair follicles from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now she faces the near-guaranteed prospect of losing her hair, likely for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Heart was exceedingly healthy before being stricken with cancer. She was in her 30s when she was diagnosed, a rarity given breast cancer generally strikes over women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After starting her last available treatment, Enhertu, three months ago, Nicola Heart's pain has disappeared, the metastases in her lungs are gone, her liver is shrinking again, and her tumor markers are decreasing, allowing her to spend more quality time with her son&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though Enhertu is highly targeted, the chemotherapy component is very strong and causes hair loss that even cold caps can't prevent. Cold caps are more effective with older chemotherapy drugs but more aggressive drugs like Enhertu can overcome the protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are so many “cute wigs and short hairstyles” – but no, that’s not me. When I look in the mirror, I won’t recognize myself,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since responding so positively to her last line of treatment, she is taking advantage of whatever time she has left.&lt;/p&gt;

She said her eight-year-old son is her greatest motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart said: ‘He loves sports, and I love watching him play.

"Fortified foods like omega-3-enriched eggs and certain dairy products can also provide some omega-3s in the diet," says Amy Goodson, a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in Dallas. Another beneficial omega-3 is known as alpha linolenic acid (ALA), which is found abundantly in canola and soybean oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No matter which animal-based or plant-based options you consume, "we know it's preferable to increase omega-3 intake from foods rather than from supplements," says JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and the principal investigator of key omega-3s &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415637/" target="_blank"&gt;VITAL research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Why fish oil supplements are not all they’re cracked up to be &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Omega-3 properties are most powerful when they come directly from food—which offers a wider array of nutrients and more concentrated amounts of EPA, DHA, and ALA. There’s also a difference in the chemical structure of the fat in whole fish versus extracted fish oil, says Monti; and the manufacturing process can degrade the quality of nutrients in supplements and can even introduce worrisome contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An even more compelling reason to stick with food over omega-3 supplements? The purported cardiovascular benefits of fish oil supplements remain largely unproven in healthy people. "A lot of people became obsessed with fish oil about two decades back because there was initially some compelling data on improved heart health," says Freeman, "but this data has since been largely refuted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/dietary-supplements-health-facts" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;5 things you should know before trusting that supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Indeed, much of this early research relied almost entirely on observational studies that were unable to prove causation. In subsequent randomized controlled trials—where causation can be measured—"supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids have shown no benefits," says Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Cleveland Clinic Heart, Vascular, and Thoracic Institute. Many &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33993205/" target="_blank"&gt;recent randomized trials&lt;/a&gt; have even tested fish oil pills against placebos and found no one more beneficial than the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This hasn't stopped over-the-counter fish oil supplement brands from touting purported heart-healthy benefits on their bottles though. "Over 20 years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim for fish oil that it may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease—but we didn't have the trial data we now do," says Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She explains that the FDA stipulated at the time that its approval was based largely on observational studies and that randomized controlled trials were still needed. "Although subsequent large, well-conducted trials have since been done for omega-3 supplements and shown no benefit on cardiovascular events,” Navar says, “this outdated claim still hasn't been re-reviewed by the FDA.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An FDA spokesperson tells National Geographic that qualified health claims like this one means they were originally supported by scientific evidence but are not required to “meet the more rigorous ‘significant scientific agreement’ standard required for an &lt;i class=" "&gt;authorized&lt;/i&gt; health claim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To prevent consumers from being misled about the level of science supporting a claim, the FDA official notes that “a qualified health claim is accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language that describes the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:18:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxObWhTNW9kRDVkbXZmTEVabXRHa29DRjFKSEo4VkZrNDI1ZEsxenBxNEZoZERsMWU1bmFBV0xKSUJGQUllUmZ3elQxVTJFcllBN0dsNnhfSFhsRjJqdEZMSnBSRGh3Y25LMlhQUl90NVA5cTRnTHA2ZUFXMUI5YU1QUk1qaUF4dw</guid></item><item><title>Tattoos Could Be a Hidden Cancer Risk, Study of Twins Finds - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNd2pyLUIwMkE2bmtPTHhHWElWSnFGRXhseHlpVVdJVzV4eXM4b2U0bWV1X3MxaU9Rb1pTNGVNRUhEbHZnNEhiemtSMkFXNjRrSUprTzJvODRFUm9YSXUtZ3dXM2JMYWtGVnZiOWRkX2xQRjFmVTdiN0FuV2x1TWtCdUItZXF0MmRZSUoyazNRS3dEVWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Your next tattoo might be riskier than currently assumed, recent research suggests. Scientists found evidence of a potential link between tattoo ink and a higher risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) conducted the study, published this January in BMC Public Health. They compared twins, finding that those who got tattoos had a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer and lymphoma. More research is needed to understand whether this connection is causal and the reasons behind it if so, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tattoos have become increasingly popular. According to a 2023 Pew survey, one-third of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/15/32-of-americans-have-a-tattoo-including-22-who-have-more-than-one/"&gt;currently sport a tat&lt;/a&gt;, with 22% having more than one. Given that, it’s important to know the potential long-term effects of tattoos, and the researchers say that not enough work has been done to understand whether tattoo ink could be carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, they analyzed data from the Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort (DTTC). The DTTC was created in 2021 by SDU scientists to survey twin pairs about their tattoo history, with volunteers solicited from the long-running Danish Twin Registry, also &lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/dtr"&gt;maintained&lt;/a&gt; at SDU. This allowed the researchers to know a person’s tattoo status and to track whether they later developed cancer. They specifically looked for cancer cases in parts of the body where particles of tattoo ink are known to deposit, such as the skin and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All told, the researchers had information on nearly 6,000 adult twins, which they used to conduct two different types of studies that compared the cancer-related outcomes of tattooed and non-tattooed twins. In both designs, twins with tattoos were noticeably more likely to develop skin cancer and lymphoma than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The exact added risk associated with tattooing differed depending on the type of cancer, the characteristics of the tattoo, and other relevant factors like age. But the largest associated risk was seen with tattoos larger than the size of a palm—people with these tattoos had a risk two to three times higher of these cancers than people without tattoos at all. That’s key, because it’s a possible sign of a dose-response effect, which would strengthen the case for there being a real association here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are concerned that tattoo ink interacting with surrounding cells may have severe consequences,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research alone can’t be used to confirm a cause-and-effect relationship between tattoos and cancer. But twin studies in general do allow scientists to avoid many of the limitations of similar research (because twins are so genetically and often environmentally alike, there’s less noise in the data to worry about). There have also been at least four other studies in recent years examining this issue. Three of these &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00228-1/fulltext"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, two of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.70260"&gt;which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/2020/05000/cosmetic_tattooing_and_early_onset_basal_cell.20.aspx"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at U.S. residents, have suggested a possible link, while one &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/29/10/2093/124436/Tattoos-and-Hematologic-Malignancies-in-British?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find any relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there could still be other explanations. People who get tattoos may be more likely to engage in other cancer-linked behaviors like smoking and drinking. So having a tattoo may simply be an indirect marker of increased cancer risk generally, not a cause of it. Tattoos might also lessen the chances of someone noticing their skin cancer early,, which could then lead to worse outcomes (in this scenario, tattoos wouldn’t be causing cancers, but would be making them more dangerous).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another lingering question, assuming this connection is genuine, is exactly what’s behind it. It’s possible that tattoo ink can agitate our body’s cells in a particular way, causing inflammation or other changes that could fuel cancer formation. Some research has also found that ingredients found in certain ink colors, such as black or red, are more harmful or allergy-inducing than others. The researchers didn’t find clear evidence of a color effect in their study but aren’t yet discounting that it could be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In any case, the team says that more research is needed to get to the bottom of this potential issue. “Studies that pinpoint the etiological pathway of tattoo ink-induced carcinogenesis are recommended,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, researchers across several fields, including &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lgbtq-rights/t-17455109"&gt;LGBTQ+&lt;/a&gt; health and gender identity, climate and environment, and medical research disciplines have had &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/us-science-funding-freeze-a-threat-to-academic-freedom/a-71501071"&gt;research financing taken away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, research on vaccine hesitancy suffered this fate. More than 30 grants for researching public mistrust of immunizations have been terminated, according to several US media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these cuts, the role of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vocal vaccine skeptic — looms large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar requests reportedly preceded the administration's decision to scrap support for vaccine hesitancy research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers speaking on condition of anonymity also told US media that NIH officials advised them to remove mRNA references from their grant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a stop to mRNA research would have far-reaching consequences since the technology is at the forefront of current medical developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;mRNA, the basis for two COVID vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA technology's biggest claim to fame is as the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/katalin-kariko-and-drew-weissman-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine/a-66978845"&gt;basis for the COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; created by BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna within a year of the coronavirus pandemic. The researchers behind the technology &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/katalin-kariko-and-drew-weissman-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine/a-66978845"&gt;were also awarded a Nobel Prize in Medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using an inactivated version of the virus as with many other vaccines — and AstraZeneca's first-released COVID jab — the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coronavirus-vaccine/t-55769446"&gt;BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna shots&lt;/a&gt; contained mRNA, or messenger RNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA is a genetic molecule occurring in multicellular organisms, including plants, animals and fungi. It acts as a genetic script — giving a template for the body to produce proteins that perform specific and essential functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccines containing an mRNA script prompt the body's cells to produce proteins identical to the spike proteins on the outer shell of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coronavirus-latest/t-52104885"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. It means the vaccinated person’s &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/immune-system/t-66950642"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; has a target to identify and immediately attack the pathogen in the event of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vaccines were highly effective in protecting against severe symptoms and likely saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims by conspiracy theorists that the shots altered the DNA of recipients made many people distrustful of the vaccines. This fear is unfounded, since mRNA vaccines don’t enter the nucleus of cells, where our primary genetic information is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malaria mRNA vaccines now in development limbo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/malaria/t-67585233"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; vaccine currently in wide use ― known as "RTS,S" or "Mosquirix" ― is not an mRNA shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But mRNA-based malaria vaccines are in development. They could help fight the mosquito-borne disease that kills roughly 600,000 people every year, between two-thirds and three-quarters of whom are children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.doherty.edu.au/news-events/news/mrna-technology-to-develop-powerful-malaria-vaccine" title="External link — research team from New Zealand and Australia revealed they had developed an mRNA shot"&gt;research team from New Zealand and Australia revealed they had developed an mRNA shot&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was successful in animal models. The vaccine stimulates immune cells in the liver, where the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasite travels after it enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a big leap, of course, from animal models to human medical trials, and then to a vaccine. The process can take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, experts believe mRNA vaccines are particularly suited to tackle malaria because they can be adjusted quickly in case of mutations in the disease. That's also a plus for the mRNA flu vaccines currently in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German pharmaceutical company BioNTech was running phase one and two trials of its own mRNA malaria vaccine, meaning the shot was tested on humans. But as of March 5, 2025, this was &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/fda-puts-clinical-hold-on-biontechs-malaria-vaccine-trial/" title="External link — halted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US"&gt;halted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the trials were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BioNTech was requested to make changes and is working with the FDA to address those requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An mRNA cancer vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines are also being explored for several other diseases, including hard-to-treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; has a high mortality rate ― nine in ten patients don't survive. But researchers in the US are working on a vaccine that would keep the cancer from returning once the initial tumor has been surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent phase one clinical trial showed that, in some patients, the vaccine activated tumor-specific immune cells that remained in the body up to nearly four years after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/a-vaccine-for-pancreatic-cancer/a-65705453"&gt;pancreatic cancer vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is being developed cooperatively by BioNTech and US company Genentech, had to be personalized for each trial participant. It causes the body's cells to produce neoantigens, a specific protein found only on that patient's tumor. This trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells as something foreign that need to be fought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shot is still in development; &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" title="External link — results from the trial were published in the journal Nature"&gt;results from the trial were published in the journal Nature&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US were to put a halt to all federal funding for mRNA research, it's unclear to what extent developments like those of cancer or malaria vaccines would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

By the half-year mark he had lost almost half his body weight, dropping from 300lbs to 157lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the South Carolinian landed a role in a commercial advertising the drugs for his employer at the time, the telehealth giant LifeMD.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the ad he explained how his father's death had led him to 'fill the void with food.'  Modeling a new svelte look, he told viewers: 'I had made up my mind, I was done embarrassing myself. For the first time in five years, I feel confident, I feel the difference. Making a change is possible, it can happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What he didn't realize was that his rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-28216040-040c-11f0-96bb-71ecf3495362"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; was silently causing devastating health effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-four now claims in a lawsuit against the doctor who treated him, that he has so much pain in his joints, muscles and stomach after taking Ozempic that he spends up to 18 hours a day in bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fatty tissue in his ears have also deteriorated at such a rate that he is plagued by 'severe equilibrium and imbalance issues, making it hard for him to stand and walk, especially up and down steps'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple affidavits in connection with the lawsuit claim that he can also no longer communicate, he suffers from memory loss, and experiences quadruple vision at times. Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to a rare eye condition that can cause vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507013/Pharmacist-warns-rise-painful-digestive-disease-jabs-Mounjaro.html"&gt;loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family, who are seeking damages of $35.8 million, claim in court records that during November 2022 and 2023 the doctor over-prescribed a combination of 'overlapping', and sometimes unapproved, drugs to speed up his weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point the complaint reveals that Roberts, a former high-flying chief operating officer, was losing up to 3.5lbs a week, which exceeds the recommended weight loss rates of around 1 to 2lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brent Wilkerson, who has treated Roberts since 2023 for his hearing issues, adds in the suit that because the fat surrounding his ear tubes shrank so fast, he is no longer able to hear property and 'everything sounds muffled as if he were underwater, all while constantly experiencing tinnitus (ringing in the ears)'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his assessment of Roberts' condition, he continues in court documents: 'Loud noises make the tinnitus worse, causing severe piercing pain, pressure and migraine headaches. He wears wool caps over his ears in an attempt to muffle loud sounds.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden and rapid weight-loss can cause the fatty tissue surrounding the Eustachian tubes, which connect your ears to the back of your throat, to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause the tubes to stay open when they should be shut, and ultimately result in hearing issues that are rarely but increasingly being reported by those on Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts has undergone at least six surgeries to try and remedy his hearing problems but he says with no success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another one of the court documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Off the back of his transformation Roberts landed a role in a commercial advertising the drugs for his employer at the time, the telehealth giant LifeMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She states: 'Roberts does not have the mental capacity to make life decision of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lockard says in the suit she noticed a rapid decline with Roberts around December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, she says that she treated him regularly for mental health matters and 'issues in the ordinary course including generalized anxiety' and nothing led her to question his 'capacity to make financial or personal decisions'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was an active and involved father and husband,' she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, around December 2023, a year into his weight loss, Dr Lockard claims in the suit she started noticing a concerning change in Roberts' behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-bf7c2f60-0371-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;: 'Roberts began to complain to me that his medical ailments had impacted his ability to function normally and had rendered it impossible for him to follow and / or understand his email correspondence, transmit email correspondence, read and understand correspondence that he received and focus and / or concentrate on any communication (whether oral or written).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts allegedly complained, according to the suit, that he could not bank, drive more than a few minutes at a time or engage in intimate acts with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, warns that the overuse of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic can have devastating consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the affidavits, he notes: &lt;span&gt;'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As noted by Dr Wilkerson, Roberts' therapist Dr Lockard says in her statement that she also found Roberts 'complained (and continues to complain) of excruciating pain in both ears'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the other complaints he relayed to her during therapy sessions, Dr Lockard reveals: 'His teeth are constantly in pain and feel soft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At one point he said he was losing up to 3.5lbs a week on weight loss drugs, which exceeds the recommended weight loss of around 1 to 2lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The roof of his mouth is almost constantly burning, but at other times his whole mouth feels ice cold. His tongue feels swollen and he cannot eat anything that is firm. He relies on soft foods and protein shakes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is not much research around the effect of weight loss medications on oral health Dr Fatima Khan, a dentist and co-founder of Riven Oral Care in Maryland, says that some of the things she has heard of include acidic tastes in the mouth, enamel erosion, sensitive teeth and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because some weight loss drugs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy, can cause acid reflux or heartburn as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with his physical health being impacted, Dr Lockard says in the suit that Roberts is also suffering from neurocognitive deficits with 'holes in his memory that never previously existed' and 'limited short-term memories'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms Dr Lockard says she has observed include tremors, slurred speech, brain fog, and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes in one of the court documents: 'Regrettably, none of the ailments described have abated and, in my professional opinion, have grown worse and appear unlikely to abate in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts alleges in the suit that his weight loss medications were prescribed after a video consultation with Dr Puopolo via LifeMD and no follow-up appointments were scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also claims he was not warned about the potential side effects or of other treatments available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, says in the suit that from the evidence he has seen, that he believes Dr Puopolo was negligent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concludes: 'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No trial date has been set to resolve the case. In response to the allegations against Dr Puopolo, who was working through the platform LifeMD at the time, a spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'As we have explained in our court filings, the allegations in the case are meritless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have already made a motion to the court to have the case dismissed as a matter of law, and we look forward to the court's decision on that motion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-a55ab3d0-034f-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by lowering blood sugar levels. Diabetes can be genetic – known as type 1 diabetes, but around three quarters of the 38.4 million cases in the US are type 2 and caused by poor diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studies revealed that the drug, which falls into the category of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1s) injections, was a highly effective appetite-suppressant, the weekly injections were repurposed to treat weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, 92 percent of new Ozempic users had been diagnosed with diabetes. By 2021, this had fallen to 77 percent and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some experts said there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and claim the incidents are very rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests patients taking Ozempic, which contains an active ingredient called semaglutide, can lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking another GLP-1 drug called Mounjaro lose as much as a fifth of their body weight over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around a fifth of people who take weight-loss injections suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For most, these issues fade after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of greater concern are reports of pancreatitis. This causes inflammation of the pancreas, an organ in the abdomen which produces digestive hormones. In some cases, pancreatitis can be life-threatening and trigger organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study carried out by researchers at Harvard University last year concluded that taking Ozempic doubles the risk of a rare condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to the nerves of the eye becomes blocked, causing vision loss. But despite the increased risk, the condition is still thought to only occur in one in every 4,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are not any official warnings about hearing problems associated with Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like Robers, patients in online support groups are increasingly raising the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out to Novo Nordisk (the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and Eli Lilly and Company (the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) for comment on Roberts' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Being 'tired all the time' for at least a few weeks, and experiencing extreme fatigue after gentle exercise are red flag signs, doctors have warned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Milli Raizada, an NHS GP specialising in hormone health, has said Britons should seek medical help if they show signs of persistent fatigue &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Prolonged, unrelenting fatigue lasting more than six months meets the diagnostic criteria for CFS/ME, but even tiredness that persists for a few weeks should not be ignored,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/normal-tiredness-vs-chronic-fatigue_uk_67dab1c3e4b0e3967487d872"&gt;Huff Post UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early assessment and blood tests can help identify or rule out potential causes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of the condition — which blights comedian Miranda Hart — can include cognitive difficulties such as memory problems and poor concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Muscle or joint pain, unexplained headaches, dizziness or heart palpitations’ may also accompany the exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same goes for ‘frequent sore throats or swollen glands, suggesting immune dysfunction,’ Dr Raizada added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, but doctors can try a series of medications to target symptoms, including antidepressants, as well as physiotherapy and counselling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-81d4d040-0655-11f0-8f67-9de523b21592" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says energy management can be one of the most effective treatments - offering guidance on how to get the most out of your available energy without worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, comic and actor Miranda Hart recounted her three-decade battle with chronic fatigue syndrome that 'left her bedbound and without joy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies write job postings carefully in hopes of attracting the ideal candidate. However, they may unknowingly attract &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-021-04761-z"&gt;and select&lt;/a&gt; narcissistic candidates whose goals and ethics might not align with a company’s values or long-term success. Research shows that narcissistic employees are more likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51276"&gt;to behave unethically&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-012-1528-7"&gt;legal consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While narcissistic traits can lead to negative outcomes, we aren’t saying that companies should avoid attracting narcissistic applicants altogether. Consider a company hiring a salesperson. A firm can benefit from a salesperson who is persuasive, who “thinks outside the box,” and who is “results-oriented.” In contrast, a company hiring an accountant or compliance officer would likely benefit from someone who “thinks methodically” and “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bending the rules is of particular concern in accounting. A significant amount of research examines how accounting managers sometimes bend rules or massage the numbers to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2005.01.002"&gt;achieve earnings targets&lt;/a&gt;. This “earnings management” can misrepresent the company’s true financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my co-author &lt;a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/nick-seybert"&gt;Nick Seybert&lt;/a&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5135440"&gt;working on a paper&lt;/a&gt; whose data suggests rule-bender language in accounting job postings predicts rule-bending in financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current findings shed light on the importance of carefully crafting job posting language. Recruiting professionals may instinctively use rule-bender language to try to attract someone who seems like a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1996.tb01790.x"&gt;good fit&lt;/a&gt;. If companies are concerned about hiring narcissists, they may want to clearly communicate their ethical values and needs while crafting a job posting, or avoid rule-bender language entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What still isn’t known&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we find that professional recruiters are using language that attracts narcissists, it is unclear whether this is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we are unsure what really drives rule-bending in a company. Rule-bending could happen due to attracting and hiring more narcissistic candidates, or it could be because of a company’s culture—or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Two measles exposures were reported at Reagan National Airport and on the Yellow Line last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposures were possible on the airport’s terminal shuttle bus between noon and 2:30 p.m., the Virginia Department of Health announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/03/20/virginia-health-officials-investigating-additional-potential-measles-exposures-in-northern-virginia/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. They were also possible between 12:15 and 3:15 p.m. on the Yellow Line train from the airport, transferring at the L’Enfant Plaza station to the Silver Line train heading toward Downtown Largo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VDH spokesperson clarified that the exposures only happened on transit, not inside DCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another measles exposure was also reported at Dulles International Airport on March 5. This is in addition to a previous March 5 exposure reported &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/12972-2/"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both people are Maryland residents who recently traveled together internationally,” the VHD said. “Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the second and third reported instances of measles traveling through Northern Virginia this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health offers the following advice to anyone who may have been exposed to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days from the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete press release is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) was notified of &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx"&gt;two additional confirmed cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; that traveled through Northern Virginia Wednesday, March 5 and Friday, March 14. Both people are Maryland residents who recently traveled together internationally. Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listed below are the dates, times, and locations of the potential exposure sites in Virginia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dulles International Airport (IAD) on Wednesday, March 5:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concourse A, on transportation to the International Arrivals Building (IAB) and in the baggage claim area between 8 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concourse A, on transportation to the main terminal and in the baggage claim area between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. (&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/12972-2/"&gt;Previously reported&lt;/a&gt; March 9 and unrelated to this new exposure.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) on Friday, March 14:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal Shuttle Bus between 12 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington Area Metro on Friday, March 14:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow Line Train from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station transferring at the L’Enfant Plaza station to the Silver Line Train heading towards the Downtown Largo station between 12:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any additional exposure sites identified in Virginia will be posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;VDH Measles website&lt;/a&gt;. Additional exposure sites have been identified in &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia has not had any reported cases of measles in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if you were at the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days from the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to fourteen days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. Virginia has high measles vaccination rates, with approximately 95% of kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles. However, infants who are too young to be vaccinated, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to measles. Infants six months through 11 months of age who will be traveling internationally, or to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/"&gt;outbreak setting&lt;/a&gt;, should receive one dose of MMR vaccine prior to travel. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request records from the &lt;a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8"&gt;VDH Immunization Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. For additional information, contact your &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/local-health-districts/"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can call VDH at (804) 363-2704 or email &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4722372e1835223437282934220731232f69312e35202e292e2669202831"&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2c495c45735e495f5c43425f496c5a4844025a455e4b4542454d024b435a"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

ROACH: I am a 69-year-old female in excellent health, other than having been treated for breast cancer eight years ago. (I underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, then five years on an aromatase inhibitor.) Since then, I have gained 40 pounds. I am 5 feet, 2 inches tall, and weigh 178 pounds. I have been unable to lose the weight despite working out at least 1 hour every day and following a healthy (Mediterranean-style) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPBQDVLLBJFJJEEANP5DOJ36YE"&gt;I am told by my oncologist that being within a healthy BMI weight range is one of the best things I can do to prevent reoccurrence. I was told by another physician to limit my calories to 1,000 per day, but I found it difficult to maintain this low of a caloric intake given my activity level. Why can’t I lose weight despite all of my efforts? -- D.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HNHC2OLBBFDFLA32GUI6OE3PAU"&gt;ANSWER: The answer to this is beyond my power to answer, except to say that humans have evolved to be able to survive with very little food, and we have adaptations that let us survive. Most people in industrial countries no longer have times of prolonged famine, so the human trait of holding on to our energy supplies (mostly fat) is no longer adaptive, since excess weight is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SI3EHBH6S5FDNJ6TZWJN54XCQU"&gt;In the case of breast cancer, women with a higher BMI do have higher rates of recurrence compared to women in the “normal” range, which was defined as 18.5-25. (This is well below the average weight among women in the United States.) The BMI is a flawed measurement but is still commonly used in studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7OUWFFKPD5DZHG6O6VH77E7TYE"&gt;In a large study, women with a BMI of 18.5-25 had a 1.7% risk of recurrence per year, while women with a BMI of 30-35 (yours is 32.4) had a 2.2% risk of recurrence per year. This is a significant amount but may not be as much as you were expecting. I disagree that weight is a major factor in breast cancer reoccurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LXHZIRDRAVAXVJBEMEZQIDZWPI"&gt;In most of my patients, I recommend against weight loss as a primary goal. I would much rather have my patients eat well (a Mediterranean-style diet is an excellent choice) and exercise regularly (1 hour a day is great) than restrict calories to lose weight. However, there are times when weight loss is important in addition to a healthy diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L6424F45P5DJ7G6ZR4XMCSDE2Y"&gt;In postmenopausal women with breast cancer, it is reasonable to consider that an effective means of weight loss might reduce cancer recurrences, but this is unproven. I did read studies showing that GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Zepbound) were effective for weight loss in women with breast cancer. However, different kinds of studies would be needed to see whether they (or another kind of weight-loss treatment, such as bariatric surgery) reduce relapse rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZIBE4GU63NFO7GTANVTJGQKBMU"&gt;Since these drugs are very expensive, it is difficult to afford them for most people without insurance, and insurance companies generally require either severe obesity or a demonstration of weight-related morbidities (such as sleep apnea) to prescribe these drugs. For now, this would be a conversation between you and your breast oncologist, general doctor, or an expert in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess visceral fat can increase your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifting weights is one of the most effective ways to help reduce visceral fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before you start a weight lifting routine, consider consulting a personal trainer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; is a type of fat found in your abdominal cavity, surrounding your internal organs. In excess, it can increase your risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. If you’ve ever searched for the best exercise to lose weight, specifically visceral fat, you may have come across some unrealistic or downright outlandish workout plans. But what if the most effective exercise was one you hadn’t even considered? One tried-and-true exercise method that has been praised for years by experts often goes overlooked. Below, we reveal why &lt;strong&gt;lifting weights is the No. 1 surprising exercise for reducing visceral fat&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lifting weights is a form of resistance or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;. It improves muscular fitness by working specific muscles or groups of muscles. You can lift weights by picking up dumbbells, using weight machines or even using your own body weight (think squats or pushups).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We also consult two sports dietitians to discuss why it works and share their tips on how to add it to your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-lifting-weights-works-for-reducing-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Lifting Weights Works for Reducing Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lifting weights helps reduce visceral fat by increasing muscle mass, which helps boost resting metabolism and promotes fat oxidation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thesportsnutritionplaybook.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Goodson, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD,&lt;/a&gt; a sports dietitian and owner of The Sports Nutrition Playbook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body consists of muscle and fat mass—both of which are essential. If you recall back to high school health class, your teacher may have held up life-size models of 1 pound of muscle and 1 pound of fat. While they weigh the same, fat takes up more space, while muscle mass is more dense and compact. When you start lifting weights regularly, your body tends to lose fat mass (including visceral fat) while simultaneously building dense and more compact muscle tissue. This leads to a change in body composition, and you don’t even have to cut calories to see results.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “In the absence of intentional caloric restriction, resistance training seems to decrease visceral fat in individuals with and without obesity alike,” says Marie Spano, M.S., RD, CSCS, CSSD, sports nutritionist for the Washington Nationals and Atlanta Hawks. She points to a study that found resistance training effectively reduced visceral fat in individuals both with and without obesity, even without a calorie restriction.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This could be due to the fact that there’s an afterburn effect that occurs with lifting weights. “While cardio burns calories during exercise, weight lifting continues to burn calories post-workout through excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), making it highly effective for fat loss,” explains Goodson. A study on women found that just 30 minutes of resistance training significantly increased expenditure, with effects detected up to 14 hours post-exercise, and boosted resting metabolic rate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, lifting weights (along with other forms of exercise) can help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7822525/mental-benefits-of-exercise/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relieve stress&lt;/a&gt;, which may also support visceral fat loss. Strength training has been linked to lower stress levels, which can further reduce the likelihood of visceral fat accumulation, says Goodson.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The more muscle a body holds the more calories it burns each day,” says Spano. The reason for this is because muscle mass is more metabolically active than fat (which is a good thing!). The more metabolically active tissue you have, the more calories you burn, even at rest. This means that even when you’re lounging on the couch, your body is still burning more calories if you have more muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spano explains that as you gain muscle, your body’s overall calorie expenditure increases. “When calorie output is higher than calories consumed, the body taps into its fat stores, including visceral fat,” she adds. In other words, if you are burning more than what you’re eating, it can help reduce body fat, including visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, gaining muscle helps support healthy hormone production, which in turn can reduce visceral fat. Goodson explains, “Muscle helps improve hormonal balance, reducing cortisol levels that can contribute to abdominal fat accumulation.” Research has shown a link between stress and obesity, and elevated levels of cortisol (the body’s stress hormone) are associated with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-stress-cause-weight-gain-8653248" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, especially around the abdominal cavity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Building up muscle through exercise can improve the body’s sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Research suggests lifting weights helps lower blood sugar levels by enhancing insulin function and reduces the likelihood of excess glucose being stored as fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-started-weight-lifting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get Started Weight Lifting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting something new can be intimidating, but you can consult an expert in the field. Spano recommends that beginners begin weight lifting by booking a session with a personal trainer or strength coach. She says, “They can assess your current state of fitness and develop a plan that fits into your lifestyle and also utilizes the equipment readily available to you while also helping you set realistic goals.” Working with a professional can also help teach you how to use equipment and prevent injury. It’s always a good idea to loop in your primary care provider before starting any new training regimen, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Goodson suggests that beginners start with full-body strength training exercises like squats, dead lifts, lunges and pushups. She recommends first focusing on nailing down the correct form, as it can help prevent injury. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you feel comfortable, you can add body weight, resistance bands or light dumbbells, before gradually progressing to heavier weights. If you can, work your way up to two to three training sessions per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For significant visceral fat reduction, Goodson recommends weight lifting three to five times per week, alternating upper and lower body days, combined with a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021744/meal-plan-to-gain-more-muscle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating plan&lt;/a&gt; and adequate recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lifting weights is the No. 1 surprising exercise for reducing visceral fat, according to experts. Weight lifting helps change body composition by increasing muscle mass, which is metabolically active and can burn more calories even while you’re at rest. Gaining muscle can increase your metabolic rate and regulate hormones, which also contributes to reducing visceral fat. Before you start, consider consulting with your health care team and a personal trainer to learn proper weight-lifting form. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can gradually increase the weight and frequency of your weight-lifting sessions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, alongside a little Ultherapy for a saggy neck and a few zaps of Clear + Brilliant laser for loathsome sun spots, you could boost your mood and zap brain fog on the same office visit? Courtesy of a new magnetic-field treatment dubbed &lt;a href="https://bodybybtl.com/solutions/exomind/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Exomind&lt;/a&gt;, patients of Manhattan dermatologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://pfrankmd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Paul Jarrod Frank&lt;/a&gt; can do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And no one sounds more excited about Exomind than Frank himself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I actually went to medical school to become a psychiatrist, and I feel that I use my skills and background in psychology every day,” Frank says. “With the overwhelming demand and advancements in functional and longevity medicine, beauty, health, and wellness no longer sit on opposite ends of the cafeteria. They are all integrally woven into helping people achieve the best version of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That level of self-actualization doesn’t come cheap; at Frank’s practice, the recommended six-session course of treatment clocks in at $4,800. And while the skin doc assures that lasting effects kick-in after the third session, most partakers can expect occasional maintenance visits to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created by Prague-based medical device purveyor BTL, Exomind is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment designed to improve mental and emotional well-being and is FDA-approved for the treatment of depression. In Canada, it also gets the green light for helping to tackle anxiety, OCD and issues with compulsive eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Frank, who deploys multiple BTL-crafted devices at his practice, including Emsculpt for body contouring and Emsella for treating postpartum incontinence, Exomind is based on well-established technology called TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). To drill down the science, magnetic fields are used to boost neuron activity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the portion of the brain that regulates mood and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with the older versions of TMS technology is that they were very time-consuming, requiring multiple consecutive days for hours at a time,” says Frank. “It wasn’t realistic for patients unless they had severe emotional and mental disease states.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Frank isn’t expecting his own patient population to seek out Exomind for the treatment of major mental illness, they may be looking for help with dealing with digital distraction and the stress and anxiety of city life. And for many, the hope of getting off prescription meds via soothing, 30-minute Exomind sessions is enough of a lure to give them a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City-based media buyer Olivia Kessler, who completed her sixth Exomind session at the PFrankMD Upper East Side office in February, found the treatments so chill she even fell asleep during one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having already tried Emsculpt, Kessler was familiar with the technology and trusted Frank’s suggestion that Exomind might be another tool in her kit to help with mood swings generated by her longstanding PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A “naturally stressed” city dweller who says she feels the need to be hypervigilant at all times, Kessler was also seeking an alternative to the generic version of Prozac her doctor prescribed for dealing with her pre-menstrual emotional rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only has Exomind helped with mood regulation, it’s also curbed any tendency Kessler had toward procrastination. “I feel like I have a pep in my step,” she says, “a little extra energy that I didn’t have before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Kessler, parking herself on Frank’s office couch with an electro-magnetic skullcap for half an hour at a pop has been worth the time and money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I stan Exomind,” says Kessler. “And I definitely stan trying not to be on medications forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A method for slowing disease progress in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients may also delay onset in people predisposed to the disease who are yet to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The just-published results from a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on an experimental drug targeting amyloid plaque buildup suggest the treatment can indeed put the brakes on cognitive decline, if it's taken early enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am highly optimistic now, as this could be the first clinical evidence of what will become preventions for people at risk for Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/anti-amyloid-drug-shows-signs-of-preventing-alzheimers-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Washington University neurologist and senior author, Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One day soon, we may be delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease for millions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155802" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155802" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642.jpg" alt="man with alzheimer's" class="wp-image-155802 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155802" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Delaying or even preventing cognitive decline in individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's could help millions around the world. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFi_oFnotg/"&gt;Dusan Stankovic/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 73 volunteers with Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's, which is caused by genes that ramp up the production of the amyloid protein. Though the mutations are responsible for just 1 percent of all Alzheimer's cases, they make the &lt;a href="https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/for-the-community/volunteer-for-research/dian"&gt;development of the condition&lt;/a&gt; by their 50s a near certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials/dominantly-inherited-alzheimer-network-trial-unit-dian-tu"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, research was initiated into the potential of a therapy based on a combination of two  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in slowing the progress of the disease in individuals with no or with minor cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2304430"&gt;phase 3 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; failed to impact the symptoms of the two groups, one of the drugs – gantenerumab – seemed to cause dramatic improvements in the pathology itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by the clinical signs of a drop in protein markers, researchers continued investigations into whether higher doses of the treatment might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with higher-risk mutations were invited to remain with the trial and receive the drug regardless of whether they were initially in the control group that had only been given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension was itself cut short due to the failure of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to meet established goals, but an analysis of gantenerumab's impact established it still had potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who had taken the drug for both the trial period and its extension had their risk of developing symptoms cut in half. The effect might even be more dramatic – the risk of the non-symptomatic group declining in mental health only increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time, comparisons between those who had taken the drug since 2012 and those who had only taken it for a couple of years, could yet show an even greater chance of delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone in this study was destined to develop Alzheimer's disease and some of them haven't yet," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/anti-amyloid-drug-shows-signs-of-preventing-alzheimers-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we do know is that it's possible at least to delay the onset of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and give people more years of healthy life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using antibodies in this fashion isn't without risk. Gantenerumab and similar treatments have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.230009"&gt;tiny bleeds and swellings&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, which in rare circumstances can become fatal. Microbleeds are also &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000011542"&gt;known to increase&lt;/a&gt; as Alzheimer's progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other next-generation anti-amyloid treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;have been approved in the US&lt;/a&gt; for the treatment of individuals who have Alzheimer's symptoms, potentially adding years of improved cognition to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-man-fated-to-get-alzheimers-avoided-it-for-decades-but-how"&gt;Time will tell&lt;/a&gt; whether those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;anticipating &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt; neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-biomarker-can-foreshadow-early-alzheimers-years-before-symptoms"&gt;coming decades&lt;/a&gt; may also be given a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;reprieve&lt;/a&gt;. But signs that researchers are on the right track are looking increasingly positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              You know, I have to tell you, as a parent, something I think about a lot is how to have real, authentic conversations with my three teenage daughters. It can be hard sometimes. I realize that things are different for their generation. They have smartphones and screens and influencers. There is news that is constantly blaring everywhere. It's a different time. And a lot has changed right down to our biology. Take, for instance, puberty. It's one of the most awkward and yet important stages of growing up. But even that has changed. The average start of puberty in the United States now begins at eight years old for girls and nine for boys. Some kids are going through puberty even earlier than that. It also last much longer than it did before. For some people, puberty can last for up to a decade. Just think about that. All of this might come as a surprise to you.

              People know a lot about the puberty they went through, but it is not the same now.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              That's doctor Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and she's a parent. She's author of the New York Times bestselling series for girls called The Care and Keeping of You. She also has a sequel for boys called Guy stuff. She's an expert on puberty, so I decided to sit down to talk to her and try and learn. Why are kids going through puberty earlier, and is that early puberty really the new norm? I think most importantly for me, as a dad of three teenage girls, what do parents need to know about how to help their children navigate it? I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, and this is chasing life. So if you're a parent and I'm just guessing we're around the same age because I know you have two college athletes who are teenagers still, I think, or maybe early 20s, and I have three teenagers. So right around that same age, the way that we think about puberty is parents. But even I think as physicians may be totally different than than what our kids are going through. You're a pediatrician, so you obviously have updated knowledge, but for me, as just a dad, it's a totally different thing compared to 30, 40, 50 years ago.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Even up until the late 1990s, we were all taught in medical school that puberty begins around 11 or 11.5 and it takes about two, three, four years. It's a sprint and you get through it and it's super awkward and your body changes and then you're done. That was sort of the teaching and the medical school more detailed teaching was not a whole lot more detailed. It was that the path through puberty were these stages called the Tanner stages. And Tanner looked at breast development. He looked at penile and testicular growth, and he looked at hair growth. And he did these studies in the 1940s and 50s and 60s. In an orphanage outside of London. And that's where he collected all of his data. So five stages, Tanner one. Nothing's happening. You're not in it. Tanner five, you're totally done. And two, three and four. That's puberty. Girls go into puberty around age 11. They're earlier kids or later kids. But that was about it. And boys around 11.5 now. And we started to get this knowledge in the late 1990s, when a study was published by a doctor of public health named Marsha Herman Giddens. She published a study, 17,000 girls, that showed, nope, it's not 11 anymore. It's ten. And in fact, if you looked at kids according to their race, kids who are black. Their average age of pubertal onset was even earlier, and we could talk about that study and what that did, but that really rocked the world. And that was more than 25 years ago, by the way. And then more data came out. And Louise Greenspan, with others, published data in 2010 that looked to confirm that original data. And it didn't just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further. So starting in 2010, right, 14 years ago, we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country. And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening. I did not know it was happening in my own house, because it's when boys tend to get private, but that average age is between 9 and 10. So that's different. That's two years different from when we were growing up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:57
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So 11, 11.5 was what the onset of puberty. That's the age that we all sort of learned, at least when we were in medical school. And now it's become younger, maybe even as young as eight. Is that normal puberty now or is that considered early onset puberty or early puberty? How do you refer to it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:18
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love this question because I think definition of terms is the most important starting place. Right. So 8 to 9 is an average. Normal can be earlier than eight for some groups of girls. So as a pediatrician, when I was starting in practice in the year 2000, if a kid had secondary sex characteristics, if their bodies were starting to change, usually it meant breast development. And it happened before age eight. They would come into my office to see me. That was considered atypical or abnormal. Now that post has moved back to seven. So if a kid is younger than seven, they'll come see a pediatrician. But if they're over seven. Most advice is that is within the normal range. Oh, and by the way, if they're 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal. So now wrap your brain around a 5 or 6 year spread of normal onset of body changes. That's really hard for everyone to manage. And I'll add one more term that's really important. So puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation. So when you start puberty. You cannot be part of a baby making equation, and when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby. That's the definition of puberty very narrowly. The broader definition, as we talked about earlier, is all the other downstream shifts from all of those sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone floating around the body in the brain? Mood swings, friendships shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the point is puberty isn't always straightforward. Things that seem like puberty, using that narrow definition might technically not be puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There's this thing called adrenarche that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEA s, and these hormones are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. Nostrum. And when the adrenal glands release these hormones, these hormones tell the body to make more sweat and in certain places to make it with greasier thicker proteins and to sprout more hair. Some places it's new hair, some places the hair texture and color changes that sweat hair. You can imagine how body odor and pimples are related. Right? That is not puberty. That's called adrenarche. It happens around the same time as puberty. But in some kids it can happen much earlier. So a five year old can have pubic hair and they're not in puberty. Or a 15 year old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness, and no pubic hair growth. It's confusing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Adrenarche and puberty can be totally disparate in terms of is there a relationship at all between. Yes. I mean.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, because the hormones are all cousins and they can convert forms. So DHEA and DHEAS can convert into testosterone and forms of estrogen. I should add, people always ask about where body weight fits in. And the answer to that is in many bodies that carry extra weight, they have what what's called peripheral conversion of these hormones. So DHEA and DHEAS when they're floating around, the body can convert more easily into the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone when there's more body fat, which is one of the bridges that connects this, which is one of the reasons why kids who carry extra body weight tip into puberty, typically a little earlier.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is fascinating. And I mean, the question I think a lot of people will ask which are which are addressing here is, is why over the last 30, 40 or 50 years, has puberty become something that is happening younger and younger? I, you know, again, this is just me, me talking here. I had heard about high body weight being a concern because of, as you say, what the added fat might do. I had also heard about potential environmental factors playing a role here, and I'm curious what what your thoughts are on that. But this idea of stress hormones, you know, I think of stress hormones as sort of short acting hormones. The idea that sort of a persistent exposure to high levels, for example, of cortisol, could also be a culprit in tipping people into puberty earlier. I had not considered that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So the cortisol is for sure a short acting hormone. But when your adrenal glands are pumping it out 24 over seven. Because you're on social media reacting to what you're seeing, or because you're living in a stressful environment where you're expected to be an academic achiever or an athletic achiever, or if you're living in a stressful environment because you don't know where your next meal is coming from, or you don't know where you're going to sleep that night. So all of these things are what we call stressors. And by the way, there's no value judgment to be placed on which stressor is more or less important. But now you can see why every kid is exposed to stress, quote unquote stress, right? We love to throw around that term. What does it mean? It means anything that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol. And the stressors are there all the time. They're there all the time. When we went to school, we came home at the end of the day, and any dynamic that happened at school was left at school. Maybe someone called us on the corded phone and maybe one of our siblings. Let us take the call. Otherwise they were busy on the corded phone. Right now there is round the clock. Social dynamics. Romantic dynamics. Right. But I don't want to demonize this either. I think it's really, really important to be level about all this. I mean, social media, for instance. For sure. There's a connection here. But social media has also been shown to save lives, to build community for people who are marginalized and don't have it. It's too easy to be black and white about this. And so I think it's very important for us to recognize the role of stress and stressors, but also to recognize that some of the things we call stressors have huge upsides and huge positive benefits. I would never argue that the aces, the adverse childhood experiences that cause stress like food insecurity, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, witnessing violence, living in a traumatic situation. There is no upside to any of those stressors, but a lot of these sort of stressors in lives that are less challenged by ACS have positives and negatives.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Stress in and of itself is not the enemy. It's the relentless nature of stress, I guess, is what I'm hearing you say.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:13:14
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But I don't want to send people, you know, sort of screaming for the hills and stressed out because it is not a switch which goes from 0 to 100. With puberty. When we were growing up, the path for puberty was fast. Today, even though it's starting earlier, it is actually happening more slowly. So it's not like an eight year old wakes up one morning in the body of an 18 year old. It is not what's happening. What is happening is eight year olds. If their girls might be developing breast buds, they might just have breast buds for a while. It is not like they are going to have their full adult breast size immediately. And this is another thing that is layering sort of the confusion and the, the, the sense of I don't know how to help the kid in my life. Parents don't know how seriously to take any of this. And there's worry. I mean, it's just it's a mess. It's a mess of information that is so easily remedied with just some simple facts. So fact one puberty is starting earlier. Fact two it's going slower. It's going slower. Girls are getting their period a little bit earlier than they used to, but not three years earlier. It's more like somewhere between 3 and 6 months.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What about the racial divide? So when you take all these factors that could potentially be causing puberty to happen sooner. Why? Why racial divide?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Every researcher that I trust is landing at the same conclusion, which it's going to turn out not to be race. It's going to turn out to be zip code. So if you take this explanation of cortisol being at the heart of everything that's going on, and you look at the way this country sets up and the socioeconomic divide and the racial divide, it's you can't argue that the two are not completely overlapped. It's a very, very hard to look at the sociological data and say, oh, yes, we can account for racial shifts in puberty separate from zip code, socioeconomic shifts and puberty. So it's kids who are more stressed and more under-resourced, who are entering puberty the soonest. Now everyone's entering sooner. On average, the trend line is down because of something you mentioned earlier, which is these amorphous environmental causes. So the way I would describe that bucket is everything we put into and onto our body is impacting our body. Right? So it's everything from the toiletries, the cosmetics that we use, the shampoos and cleansers and moisturizers. Many, many, many of them contain chemicals in them that disrupt the hormones in our body. They change the way hormones signal. Likewise, the pollution in the air that we breathe impacts the way our bodies work, right? Everything. The water we're drinking, depending upon what's in the food we're eating, what's, you know, antibiotics that are pumped into animals that then end up on grocery shelves. There's tons of data that shows that those antibiotics shift the way our body's immune system works are inflammatory cascade. We have inflammation as a result that has impacts on the sex hormones. So it's a lot of things coming at us. But it's a reminder that there are some really incredible scientists out there who are trying to figure out what are these lowest common denominator chemicals that are showing up in these various environmental insults. We call them insults, right, that are changing the way the hormones work in our body so that we can get rid of them. And that's really important. And right now, the foods that don't have antibiotics are the toiletries Cosmetics that don't have a whole list of chemical ingredients tend to be more expensive. Right? So right. We're back to zip code. We're back to the socioeconomic drivers of puberty. So it's complicated.

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. So net net puberty everywhere is starting earlier. And we've known this for a long time. And even in very remote areas we know that puberty is starting earlier. So that's that sort of global phenomenon of what people are putting into an onto their bodies and how chemicals are shifting the path through puberty. But it looks different from country to country and region to region. And the data is kind of all over the map. And in the US we tend to be a little bit on the earlier side. So the data shows our average start of puberty has been consistently at or below the average for the world.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So puberty happening earlier isn't just a thing happening in the United States. This is a global phenomenon. But I think the real question then is just how worried should we be about kids starting to develop earlier in life? And if we are worried, when then should we as parents get involved? We'll be right back. When we talk about blue zones and things like that, places where people live better, they live longer lives, they have more social connection. You can see the benefit, and the benefit usually is something like longevity. You live longer, you have a higher health span, things like that. The question that I really sort of struggle with when it comes to puberty is, is puberty starting earlier a bad thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We have no idea. I mean, because we have no data, right? So people ask this all the time, and the answer is we only have about 25,  26 years of evidence that puberty is really started to march earlier. And so the oldest of those kids are just in middle age now, right, entering middle age. So we don't know. But what we do know is there have been trends through history of when puberty has started earlier, when puberty has started later. We are so sure that earlier puberty is bad. And yet really, if you look back through the lens of history in cultures or in societies where there was no food available, what did those kids bodies do? Their bodies slowed down their development and puberty happened much later, and it makes great evolutionary sense. The whole point of puberty is to be able to be part of a baby making equation. If your body, if you are a female and your body cannot carry a fetus because you're so nutritionally deprived. You don't have the food you need. You don't have the nutritional resources. Well, then why would the body try to develop and get itself there in order to reproduce quickly? There's no rush. So there are times where you look through historical records, and the average age of pubertal onset is 16. And that's because in those societies there was a famine. And so I'm not saying earlier puberty is good. I think we have to put everything in context.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But just in terms of mental health risks. I've been reading some about this and how girls starting puberty earlier might come with added mental health risks. Is there evidence of that then? And do we know anything for boys as well?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:15
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So for girls, the data is pretty clear and it tethers to this early data about earlier puberty, earlier body changes, more sexualization, earlier risk for predation. If your body is changing. No one's talking to you about it, or the world thinks it's happening to you. Too young. So you're not getting informed in a certain way. But then the world is sexualizing you and expects for you to either think like you're older because you look like you're older, or to behave like you're older because you look like you're older. The set up for mental health issues is tremendous, right? Also, the sex hormones, whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty, they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed. You know, Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line. It is absolutely true. And that is where third and fourth grade parents are like, wow, my kid is in puberty. They are slamming the door. I mean, that is all those hormones rising and falling and and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts. It has to be a set up for mental health issues if we are not talking about it. I will add for boys, there has been no study that looks at testosterone and quiet, but I am 100% convinced that when someone finally studies it, we will see that testosterone surges and drops are what cause the silence of tween and teen boys. We know testosterone causes rage, but the other side of that pendulum swing is silence. And it's not that they don't talk, but they talk less. And then they are rewarded for talking less or. Today's generation of parents goes well that was what I did. And I just shut my door for three years and my parents didn't say anything and was totally fine. And I emerged out the other end, and I'm okay. And that the truth is that was then. This is now that sign that you see in boys where they just become monosyllabic or grunts. It is painful for parents, it is hormonal and there are ways through it. There are conversations you can have with your boys. There are ways to pull them out of their shell. They do emerge out the other side, but they do want to be talked to. I swear. They tell us all the time, just because they're not talking a lot, doesn't mean that they don't want to be included in the conversation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is so fascinating. I mean, I think anyone listening, myself included, is thinking about those teens in their life, whether their own kids or kids friends. And it tracks. It's so interesting. I mean, it's fascinating. Let me ask you this. So if parents come to you and say that my kid seems to be going through puberty very early. What is the conversation that you'd have with parents?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So let's start with this thing. Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider. This is really important. What they need to do is they need to have a conversation, and then they need to do a physical exam, and they need to actually look at your kid. I am a pediatrician. I did not examine my own child. I did not know when my son went into puberty, but it was not my job to be his pediatrician and to examine him and to determine that. So I would take him in for his annual checkup, and if there were any concerns in between, I would take him in. And it was the pediatrician who had the conversation with him and examined him, and then I could pick up the conversation from their. Pediatricians are trained to ask parents to leave the room. By the time a kid is about somewhere 11, 12, 13, 14, they're going to kick the parent out at some point. That's totally appropriate. Then call him up, ask him, or at the end of the visit, pull him aside. Hey, is my kid in puberty or do I need to worry about anything? There are so many ways into the conversation, but hopefully the theme here is coming through that talking about it is the most important thing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:25:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Puberty can on average starts around 8 or 9, but it can be 6 or 7, you said. So I have a kid. I think they may be going through puberty at a very young age. Should I be worried about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:07
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So before age seven, for a girl, before age eight for a boy, I would say you would want to bring in medical advice. You start seeing changes in the body. You want to bring in a medical finger, but you noticed I'm not using the word concerned or worried because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren't puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:33
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But if it is happening before that age, what would the pediatrician be thinking?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They're looking for what's called precocious puberty. And precocious puberty is puberty that's happening sooner than it should. And one of the causes of precocious puberty, which is not common, but it's always on the list for every pediatrician, is a tumor that is growing in the brain, that is telling the brain to secrete the hormones called LA and FSH, that tip the body into starting puberty. That's the main thing that people are looking for. It's a tumor that is causing the hormones to release early. But I hesitate to go down that road because more often than not, the concerns turn out to be not a worry, but a great opportunity for conversation with the pediatrician, right? So, for instance, if you have a kid who's carrying extra body weight and you think they're developing breasts and actually it's just fat tissue, and a doctor can examine them and show that it's just fat tissue and there's no breast tissue, it's still a great opportunity for a conversation about nutritional wellness.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:27:43
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right? Right. But what what are some of the approaches that you've implemented as a parent, with all you've known when it comes to talking about puberty?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:27:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The best tip I have is what I did with my son, so that my oldest is her daughter, who is just a talker. But my son was not a talker. And when he went through puberty, he became really not a talker. And that was very hard for me. So the first thing I learned how to do was to sit on the other side of a closed door. So I would sit on the other side of my son's door and I would knock on the door and I would say, hey, buddy, I'm actually just sitting on the other side of the door, and I would really love to hear what's going on, and I'm going to be here for about 5 or 10 minutes. And if you want to talk, I'm just happy to sit here and talk. And it's so funny we did. My partner Vanessa and I did a podcast episode with our two sons who were going off to college this month, and there's a part of the podcast where I talk about this with my son, and I'm like, do you remember this? And he's of course, I remember it because it worked. We didn't have to look at each other. We didn't have to. There was no vulnerability. I wasn't there was no worry, you know? He was so aware of me being worried about everything right then. And there was none of that with a closed door between us. And then eventually the door opened. And then my strategy became. And it is still to this day, my strategy. Knock on the door. Always knock. Go in. He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I'd be like, hey, then how you doing? And he'd start talking. No eye contact, but my laying on his bed and him sitting in his desk, at his desk, with his back to me, was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations. That is a way of communicating with a kid that works. Everyone says do it in the car. Car is great on a walk. On a walk is great. You're just not making eye contact. So that's what worked for me, and I hope that other people can take that advice, because the parents who taught me that I'm forever grateful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:03
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I get to tell you another piece of crucial advice is to just start having these conversations. Just start talking. Have the conversations. The big ones, the small ones, the silly ones, the serious ones. Because you gotta know this. In this day and age, our kids are exposed to a lot early, and some of what they're exposed to, like it or not, is not what any parent would want.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:26
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12. Really? Yeah. Wow. And 15% of ten year olds have seen it. So if you're not having conversations like this about all of this smells and feelings and sex and all of it, if you're not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is. So it's time to get over the awkwardness. Educate yourself. Find your own trusted adult. We always tell kids to find a trusted adult. Adult find your own trusted adult, you know, bounce things off of them, but start having these conversations. They can be short. You can have many of them over many years. You will mess them up, I promise you. That's okay. Take a do over. Come back and say to your kid, you know what? I said that wrong. I want to try again. But it's really, really critical to know that there are information resources out there for them that compete with you. And if you want to be the source of information, it's up to you to do it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's up to you to do it. I think that's a really important point. If you're not having the conversation lightly, someone else is in some way, shape or form. Better that you do it, that you be the source because we owe it to our kids and to ourselves to do better. When talking about things like their bodies, the way they're changing what's on their minds. And yes, it might be uncomfortable. It might be awkward even, but it's okay. That's what chasing life is all about doing our best every day, even when it's not easy.

   &lt;p&gt;After writing 50 books, Pakistani American kids' book author &lt;a href="https://saadiafaruqi.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saadia Faruqi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is covering an issue she's never explored before in her newest title, &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the first time I've written a book that completely revolves around mental illness and the repercussions it has on family life, especially on kids," says Faruqi. "It's a topic that's very close to my heart and the theme is personal to me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Published in March, &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt; follows Mo, a Pakistani American eighth grader, as he struggles to understand his Abbu — "father" in Urdu — who has schizophrenia. The book is based on Faruqi's own rocky relationship with her father, whom she believes also had this condition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Karachi, Pakistan, Faruqi says she was afraid of her father's episodes and often felt confused. The adults never "sat me down and explained anything. Nobody said, 'Hey, don't be scared.' " She hopes &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt;, geared toward middle schoolers, can offer comfort and strength to young people who live with someone with mental illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, the book has earned &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG23OjSRlzZ/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;four starred reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Review&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/saadia-faruqi/the-strongest-heart/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;writes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: "The portrayal of serious mental illness and the complex emotions of a child whose parent suffers from it are realistic, eye-opening and moving."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Faruqi, the Houston-based author of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/905804301/welcome-to-story-hour-100-favorite-books-for-young-readers#:~:text=Yasmin%20is%20a%20spunky%20second%2Dgrader%20who%20tries%20out%20all%20kinds%20of%20occupations%20%E2%80%94%20superhero%2C%20writer%2C%20chef%2C%20zookeeper%20%E2%80%94%20whether%20or%20not%20she%20actually%20knows%20what%27s%20involved.%20But%20she%20always%20has%20fun%2C%20thanks%20to%20her%20quick%20thinking%20and%20support%20from%20her%20big%20Pakistani%20American%20family.%20(For%20ages%205%20to%208)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kids' book series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a Pakistani-American girl named Yasmin, talks to NPR about mental health in Pakistan and what she wishes she could say to her dad if he were alive today. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like for you growing up in Pakistan with a father who had mental illness? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was frightening. I never knew which dad I was going to get. When I walked into the house from school, I dreaded going inside because I didn't know whether he was going to be angry or loving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What the grown-ups knew was not always what the kids knew because there was no sharing of information. What I have pieced together is based on things I eavesdropped on as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;We think he had schizophrenia. He could have also had an adjacent kind of mental illness because many of these illnesses share a lot of symptoms. It was very unclear. [In Pakistan], there was no good way of diagnosing mental illness.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you cope? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I got completely immersed in books, especially those that took me away in terms of fantasy and had witches and dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the literature in those times was British because [Pakistan] used to be a colony of the British, and Enid Blyton, Jane Austen and Daphne du Maurier were favorite authors. Then once I entered high school, I got immersed in Shakespeare. That was the first time I realized how powerful words could be to bring about emotion in other people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did society treat your dad in Pakistan? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People would say, "He's just mad. He's crazy. Don't talk to him."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was very sensitive about this when going out. If we were at a family wedding, I had this perception that people were whispering about me or my family. There was so much shame around it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is mental health perceived in your culture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a lot of poor countries, there are no financial or medical resources. There's no understanding that if someone is acting in a certain way, there could be a reason. It may not be their fault. They may need medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if you say that to another person, they might see it as an attack. They might think: you're insulting me. It's very sad. So we do need more education, more empathy toward people who may have those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a wonderful character in the book, Naila Phupo, who is Mo's paternal aunt. She gives Mo attention, love and care — and ultimately, gets Mo's dad the medical help he needs. Tell me about her.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted Mo to have someone who could support him and not just treat him like all the relatives treated me in my family, who did not at all seem concerned. Or maybe they were concerned, but that concern was not evident to me or did not lead to any action.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you don't do anything as an adult, what's the point? So I wanted to have a character Mo could rely on to make change and help his dad get better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mo's mom is an aid worker at a refugee camp in Greece and is often away. Why didn't you want her in the picture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Again, this story is personal. Even though my mother did not leave us, emotionally she was often not present because of her job, her career and her organization. She was an educator of educators. By the end of my time in Pakistan, she was the principal of a teacher's training college, and she started a professional development society for English teachers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Everyone thought my mom was a saint for being my dad's wife, for taking care of not just him but our entire household. But she's also got her flaws. My mom was the only thing between us siblings and our dad and we often did not have that protection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why I needed Mo's mom to leave and also be somebody everyone loved. Mo's mom had a job that people were impressed with,  but only her own family knew what she was doing was wrong. She had abandoned her child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interspersed in the narrative, there are South Asian folktales about a jackal who is punished for pretending to be a king and a foolish man who puts all his eggs in a basket. Why did you decide to weave them into your book? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted to break up the tension and the negative scenes with something uplifting. Those folktales reflect how Mo is feeling and what's going on in his life and alleviate his sadness or grief or anger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your book's epilogue, you write that your dad died several years ago and you did not have a good relationship with him. If you could tell him anything now, what would you say? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I would apologize. Whenever I used to visit him, I would fight with him. I was finally taking charge of my anger and being able to talk back as an adult, because I never could as a child.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I would hug him. He was such a huggy person. I always hated it because of the relationship we had. So I would hug him and kiss him and tell him that I loved him. I think he would be very moved by that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would a book like this have meant to you when you were growing up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It would have meant the world to me. I did not think this was anybody's experience except my own.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want people to take away from the book? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's a sentence in the book that says: "The strongest heart is the one that's still beating." Even at your lowest point, the job of the heart is to make sure all your organs are getting blood so your body survives. You don't have to be amazing all the time. Sometimes there are low points, and even if you're just surviving, that's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drug-resistant type of bacteria that has adapted to health care settings evolved in the past several years to weaponize an antimicrobial genetic tool, eliminating its cousins and replacing them as the dominant strain. University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists made the discovery when combing through local hospital data—and then confirmed that it was a global phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The finding, published in &lt;a href="https://idp.nature.com/authorize?response_type=cookie&amp;amp;client_id=grover&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41564-025-01958-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, may be the impetus for new approaches in developing therapeutics against some of the world's deadliest &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It also validates a new use for a system developed at Pitt and UPMC that couples genomic sequencing with computer algorithms to rapidly detect infectious disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our lab has a front row seat to the parade of pathogens that move through the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/hospital+setting/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hospital setting&lt;/a&gt;," said senior author Daria Van Tyne, Ph.D., associate professor of medicine in Pitt's Division of Infectious Diseases. "And when we took a step back and zoomed out, it quickly became apparent that big changes were afoot with one of the world's more difficult-to-treat bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-ai-genomic-surveillance-combine-health.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Enhanced Detection System for Health Care-Associated Transmission&lt;/a&gt; (EDS-HAT) analyzes the genetic signatures of infections in hospitalized patients and flags patterns, allowing clinicians to intervene and stop potential outbreaks in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/real-time/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;real-time&lt;/a&gt;. But lead author Emma Mills, a microbiology and immunology graduate student in Van Tyne's lab, realized that EDS-HAT was also a treasure trove of detailed historical information that she could mine to learn about the evolution of bacteria over time.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Mills focused on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm), so-called because it can't be eradicated with the popular antibiotic vancomycin. VREfm kills about 40% of the people it infects and is a particular plague on immunocompromised and hospitalized patients, who are often taking antibiotics that decrease the diversity of bacteria in their microbiomes, allowing drug-resistant bacteria, such as VREfm, to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the genomic sequences of 710 VREfm infection samples from hospitalized patients entered into EDS-HAT over a six-year time span, Mills discovered that the variety of VREfm strains had shrunk from about eight fairly evenly distributed types in 2017 to two dominant strains that began to emerge in 2018 and, by the end of 2022, were the culprit in four out of every five patient VREfm samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon closer examination, Mills found that the dominant strains had acquired the ability to produce a bacteriocin, which is an antimicrobial that bacteria use to kill or inhibit one another. They'd weaponized this new capability to destroy the other VREfm strains, giving them unfettered access to nutrients for easier reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This further sparked Mills's curiosity: If this was happening at the local hospital, was it happening elsewhere? No prior research publications had explored the possibility that this was a global phenomenon, so she consulted a publicly available library of more than 15,000 VREfm genomes collected globally from 2002 through 2022. Sure enough, what she'd observed locally had also been happening on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This was a completely unexpected discovery—I was surprised to see such a dramatic signal," said Mills. "Once these strains are in an institutional setting—such as a hospital—and are matched up against other strains of VRE in a patient's gut, they take over. It's a 'kill your buddies and eat their food' scenario."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Tyne said the finding doesn't have immediate clinical consequences—it does not appear that the bacteriocin-wielding VREfm are making patients any sicker than their predecessors did. But it could point to potential avenues for the development of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The diversity of the VRE population appears to be narrowing from lots of different types, causing infection to only a few. That means we may soon have only one single target for which to design therapeutics such as antibiotics or phage therapy," Van Tyne said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It also suggests that bacteriocins are very potent and perhaps we could weaponize them for our own purposes."&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With its measles outbreak spreading to two additional states, Texas is on track to becoming the cause of a national epidemic if it doesn’t start vaccinating more people, according to public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles, a highly contagious disease that was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, has made a resurgence in West Texas communities, jumping hundreds of miles to the northern border of the Panhandle and East Texas, and invading bordering states of New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Based on the rapid spread of cases statewide — more than 200 over 50 days — public health officials predict that it could take Texas a year to contain the spread. With cases continuously rising and the rest of the country’s unvaccinated population at the outbreak’s mercy, Texas must create stricter quarantine requirements, increase the vaccine rate, and improve contact tracing to address this measles epidemic before it becomes a nationwide problem, warn infectious disease experts and officials in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This demonstrates that this (vaccine exemption) policy puts the community, the county, and surrounding states at risk because of how contagious this disease is,” said Glenn Fennelly, a &lt;a href="https://ttpelpaso.com/providers/Glenn_Fennelly.aspx"&gt;specialist&lt;/a&gt; in pediatric infectious diseases and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Texas Tech University. “We are running the risk of threatening global stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The measles outbreak — the largest in the state in 30 years — has spread from two cases in late January to more than 270 cases and now includes 11 counties, most of them in the rural South Plains region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So far this year, there have been more than 300 cases of measles confirmed across 15 states, as of March 13. The Texas outbreak, which makes up the bulk of those cases, is only linked to cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;where state officials&lt;/a&gt; said this month that someone associated with the Texas outbreak was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Last month, Texas officials reported that an unvaccinated, otherwise healthy school-aged child died from measles, the first death from the virus in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This month, New Mexico officials said an unvaccinated adult in Lea County, about 50 miles away from the outbreak’s epicenter of Gaines County, who died had tested positive for measles. Officials are still confirming whether the cause of death was measles, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is a very multi-jurisdictional outbreak with three states involved and about seven or eight different local health departments, in addition to some areas where the state serves as the local health department. There are a lot of moving parts,” said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the City of Lubbock, during a Tuesday meeting of the Big Cities Health Coalition, a national organization for large metropolitan health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most of Texas’ measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County, which traditionally has low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said efforts to increase the vaccination rates in Gaines County, which is about 70 miles from Lubbock, and the surrounding region have been slow as trust in the government has seemingly reached an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We are seeing, just like the rest of Americans, this community has seen a lot of stories about vaccines causing autism, and that is leading to a lot of this vaccine hesitancy, not religion,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; led to the politicization of vaccines and overall weariness to health mandates like quarantines and masks. Public health officials are now battling misinformation and public resistance to measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said because the state can’t stop people from traveling, she fully expects this outbreak to last a year, and the surrounding states and the nation should prepare themselves for a potential spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Measles is going to find those pockets of unvaccinated individuals, and with the number of cases and ability for people to travel, there is that risk of it entering other unvaccinated pockets anywhere in the United States right now,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="fe694c3c-564d-4104-a4e7-fe40f473f343" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly was living in New York in the 1990s when pamphlets started getting passed around the Hebrew community warning against the unfound dangers of the measles vaccine. Soon, the vaccine refusal rate began to climb, and an outbreak started filling hospitals with sick infants.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Now, decades later, Fennelly is watching the same series of events play out in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This could have been predicted. There have been steady rates of increased personal belief exemptions over the last several years leading to pockets of under-vaccination across the state,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In the West Texas region, misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials, and fear of government authority overruling family autonomy have reigned supreme, creating the pockets that measles infiltrated this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, this is not just a South Plains problem but a statewide issue as vaccine exemptions continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have several pockets of population that have high unvaccinated groups. We sent out a letter to public and private school districts with low vaccination rates explaining the situation and asking them to update their children’s shots,” said Phil Huang, director and health authority for Dallas County Health and Human Services, during the Big Cities Health Coalition meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/school"&gt;requires children and students to obtain vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to attend schools, child care centers, and college. However, individuals can claim they are exempt if they are in the military, have a religious or personal belief that goes against getting immunized, or if a health provider determines it is not safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since 2018, the number of requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for an exemption form has doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7245a2.htm"&gt;Data&lt;/a&gt; suggests that vaccine exemptions and those living in areas with higher vaccine exemption rates for measles and pertussis are at increased risk of contracting these diseases. The authors of this data collection concluded that “geographic pockets of vaccine exemptions pose a risk to the whole community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly said the hurdles to obtaining exemptions are easy to clear, leading to an increasing number of people refusing the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State lawmakers this session have filed more than a &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20those%20who%20want%20to,must%20get%20the%20affidavit%20notarized."&gt;dozen bills&lt;/a&gt; that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We don’t have the capacity in Texas to deal with so many sick children if this continues to spread. We are already at our limit with seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Our doctors are at their limit,” Fennelly said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Simbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, had to deal with a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in her city a year ago, with 64 individuals testing positive, 57 of whom were associated with a shelter. She said the quickest way they controlled the outbreak was quickly administering more than 30,000 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A Chicago Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; projected a high probability of an outbreak of more than 100 cases without the city’s rapid intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It required a lot of education and messaging because people wanted the answer to why I need to get vaccinated. We started listing out the reasons — parents won’t be able to go to work, kids can’t go to school, and even worse, kids can get sick and die,” Ige said. “It’s 2025. We shouldn’t be having children dying from measles in this day and age. We have the tools. We just have to amplify the message.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico’s public health officials started spreading awareness of vaccinations immediately after they learned Texas had its first measles case and before New Mexico got its first case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We started setting up clinics and getting the ball rolling,” Jimmy Masters, the southeast region director for the New Mexico Department of Health, said. “Let's see what we can do to get people in the doors and vaccinated beforehand.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nearly 9,000 New Mexicans have received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine shots between Feb. 1 and March 10. During that same time period last year, officials vaccinated 5,342 people.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas has held multiple vaccination clinics in the outbreak area, but according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, only 350 doses have been administered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico has also emphasized its &lt;a href="https://vaxview.doh.nm.gov/"&gt;Vaxview&lt;/a&gt; website that keeps track of residents' immunizations, allowing concerned people to check within seconds if they need a shot. Texas has a vaccine tracking program known as ImmTrac2, but it’s an opt-in program that doesn’t have most adult records. If someone doesn’t opt in by age 26, their records will not be retained.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We told people to contact us to ensure their vaccine status is up to date,” Masters said. “If they aren’t sure, just call the health office so we can find out for them. And if they don’t have their records updated for the vaccine, then we can ask them to come in and take advantage of the clinics or come in as walk-ins.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Because of this, most of Lea County is considered immunized, Masters said, so public health officials in New Mexico don’t view the outbreak as rapidly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Back in Texas, the opposite is playing out. Advice from public health officials is seemingly ignored, and vaccine efforts are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We need to have a consistent message from all levels. We need to reinforce the message that vaccines are safe and vaccines are how you prevent this, and we have concerns when other messages dilute this message,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services officials are also encouraging people to vaccinate, but whether people will listen is out of the agency’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The only way to stop the virus from spreading is to get more people immunized. We are …providing education about the severe complications associated with measles infection, and directing them to locations where they can get vaccinated,” said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the state health agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly said the main difference between Lea County and Gaines County is the public acceptance of the vaccine and public health in general. He said if Texas wants to improve, there should be studies on why people are so hesitant to accept vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We need to be asking why Gaines County? What are the concerns, and how do we, the health profession and public health officials, most effectively confront and allay those fears,” he said. “People shouldn’t be more afraid of the vaccine than the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="cc2eec3a-9c95-4a5c-93e5-7164b52bc116" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Obstacles to quarantining and contact tracing &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A person with measles visits a friend, another visits kids at a college, and the other has friends over. Public health departments in West Texas are trying to trace the spread of measles, since other than strongly suggesting people quarantine, there’s nothing more local officials can do to prevent infected individuals from traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We shouldn’t be surprised in this kind of environment that we will have more cases,” said David Lakey, the vice chancellor for health affairs and the chief medical officer at the University of Texas System. “I think we need to work with individuals to ensure they stay home during an event like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State lawmakers have stripped control from cities and counties from implementing mandates, such as closing businesses and schools. While some of these laws apply only to COVID-19, public health experts say it has created an environment where state health officials can only offer suggestions to Texans with little enforcement, allowing measles to continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The state of Texas is taking it seriously and trying to balance how they approach this while respecting the laws of the state and also people’s freedoms,” Lakey said. “They are doing it while also making sure that we are doing everything it can to identify people, provide vaccines, isolate individuals, and take all the other steps to address an event like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With young children particularly vulnerable to the disease, Lakey said hospitals must screen people entering hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said there have been a couple of women who gave birth at a Lubbock hospital who were infected with measles or were recently exposed to it, and babies six months old or younger have needed treatment with immunoglobulin because of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“That’s really why measles is so scary. It’s so communicable, and it’s so easy to enter some of the very vulnerable areas where babies don’t have those vaccinations yet,” she said. “That’s going to be day cares, schools, hospitals, pediatricians offices, and we’re seeing those cases more and more as this outbreak continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This potential spread makes contact tracing necessary, but Wells said it is one of their region's most significant challenges besides testing. While a laboratory set up in Lubbock has cut down wait times for tests results from 72 hours to one day, Wells said rural Texas doesn’t have the staff to track the travel of more than 270 people.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico has a lead investigator for contact tracing who interviews the patients, gathers medical records, establishes a point of contact, and organizes vaccinations for those who were potentially exposed to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While West Texas officials try to follow the same policies, the health care system is decentralized, meaning the contact tracing is done by the local health authority first, and then, if necessary, the state gets involved and possibly, assistance from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said while the state is not necessarily struggling to contact trace, he acknowledges the extra manpower it requires.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“That also depends on the individuals talking with us and sharing that information. So that can be difficult, particularly when dealing with a more insular community. It can be difficult to make inroads, and that is why the local process is important,” Van Deusen said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Experts say that as travel season ramps up and if Texas can’t seem to stop the spread, states nationwide should prepare themselves for what may come.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The message to health departments is be ready, and schools need to think about this and government officials because this really does have the potential to grow beyond these three states,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

It took them all day to dig the holes, then cart over all the chicken carcasses in a skid steer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They buried all the bodies, along with thousands of dollars of feed and eggs, as the USDA had instructed them to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;MariKate wept inside her N-95 mask.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg" alt="Bird flu farm."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Marty Thomas in a barn on his farm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jim Vondruska for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That day, a car had pulled up to the farm, and one of their regular customers got out, hoping to pick up fresh eggs. Still dressed in her hazmat suit, MariKate explained what had happened. He immediately handed her all the cash in his wallet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then the messages started pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Praying for you guys in this time of struggle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“All your dental friends are rooting for this to be all fixed up as quickly as possible!!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Donations to their GoFundMe campaign have swelled since word got out — as have orders for their online farmers market, the main source of their remaining revenue. They've been moved by the outpouring of support from their customers and community. But Kakadoodle Farm is still in financial peril. They’re considering applying for a private loan to keep the farm afloat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re at the bottom of our barrel,” Marty said. “If this doesn’t work, we’re out our entire life savings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg" alt="Bird flu farm."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Egg cartons and shipping materials sit in a warehouse at Kakadoodle farm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jim Vondruska for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What they keep telling themselves: They’ve weathered other disasters on the farm  — and somehow found a way to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There was the barn that burned down because of a faulty extension cord. The bacterial infection that tore through their flock, cratering egg production. There were endless mishaps and mistakes they made as they expanded their operation, battling mites and frozen water lines and the aftermath of tornados, scouring YouTube and turning to more seasoned farmers for answers.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s happened again and again and again,” Marty said. “This is crazy, what we’re doing. Like — we don’t know this world at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;And the next time, he and MariKate will be better prepared. They want to renovate their coops to keep wild birds out of the feed, while still giving the chickens space to roam. They’ll make sure to keep their farm shoes on the farm, to help reduce the spread of disease.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because bird flu isn’t leaving America any time soon. Just three weeks ago, Marty and MariKate got a call from another local farmer who suspected he had a bird flu outbreak. He agonized over whether to call the USDA. His father begged him not to, warning that the agency would come and slaughter all of their birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“All I can tell you is what we did,” MariKate told him before she hung up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The farmer made the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNbURsTTY5UWdHLTdRa1FlMU9EV3pRdV9ITGNHeEp5a3Rpb3d0RXNyWF91REhtWXlaeE1ZRkxyNFdNNE1iTnBmcVFCRzllMWpJSEVWanBuMEtmb0pxMVNMN1BBQl8tVy1FcXlDUTl0dVFub2ZpY1dzTXppcWZqdkNoXzVzQQ</guid></item><item><title>I didn't think I was well enough to do daily yoga until I tried this app that's designed with people like me in mind - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBRRTBBQXYwZFkyMTdaaTdQcVZsaTJYRnpjZDRXNks4VUdYaXZmLVlZUFd2RzFpQUFrdWNMcWNzVFZIcEJHcWpnWklKTDd6M3hqUUVZdUxVUE4tb29TOXRGLWVfczlncHBveUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals often recommend yoga to help with chronic pain, poor mental health and limited mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an on-and-off relationship with yoga, enjoying it when I had the time but struggling to commit to a daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I was diagnosed with an energy-limiting illness last year and my usual exercise routine became impossible to maintain, I found myself craving some sort of gentle movement that could help to lift my spirits without depleting my energy levels for days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter, yoga teacher Sophia Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd is the founder of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Yoga for Pain (Y4P) app&lt;/a&gt; ($9.99/£7.99 a month, seven-day free trial available) and is on a mission to make the practice more accessible for people with chronic illness. Drozd herself has multiple chronic pain conditions, which means that she appreciates first-hand just how tough it can be to get up and move some days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've actually lived with pain for about 15 years,” she says. “I was a yoga teacher already, and I had extensive knowledge of yoga of poses within different styles and breathwork techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through those years, yoga has been a big tool for me in managing pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that experience, Drozd explains that it can be difficult to practice traditional yoga when you are living with a disability, but wanted to share how she had used it to help her so it could do the same for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yoga can help to build strength as well as flexibility, which can release tension in muscles and joints” says Drozd. “It can then help to reduce stress which can make you more accepting of your condition. It can help regulate your mood, help to reduce inflammation through movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga requires a degree of focus, which can feel a lot when you experience brain fog, but this can help to improve brain function which subsequently can help us to manage continued pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The breathwork of yoga can help us to regulate the sensations of pain and improve our sleep quality encouraging our bodies to find a sense of calmness and relaxation,” adds Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then meditation, which is another one of the eight limbs of yoga, can contribute to the cognitive reframing abilities helping us to observe and accept our pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After chatting with Drozd, I promised her I would commit to a daily practice. Here's what I found using the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-easy-to-find-something-that-suits-your-situation"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s easy to find something that suits your situation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is laid out in a way that helps you locate what will work for you. In the yoga for pain section I found classes designed for people with my condition, but you can also search by body part (so yoga for hip pain, or yoga for knee pain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to just do meditation, breathwork or yoga from a chair, there are sections dedicated to these formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my condition, I have to rest in the middle of my work day, sometimes more than once, and I can wake up again feeling groggy and unrefreshed. The Y4P app features a short 10-minute practice that includes gentle stretching. It feels great but doesn’t make me sore for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also tried a bed yoga session and a class on yoga for fatigue—both of which were around 30 minutes long and led by Drozd. I enjoyed these and will do them again, but I kept coming back to the 10-minute practice after I nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-speaks-the-language-of-chronic-illness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It speaks the language of chronic illness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with chronic conditions or disabilities use the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank" data-url="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;spoon metaphor&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate their capacity, which can be depleted by physical, emotional, intellectual or social exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, having a shower might cost someone one or two spoons on a good day, and five or six spoons on a bad day. On bad days, you ration your spoons for the important stuff, like going to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spoon theory has been incorporated into the Y4P app using spoon emojis next to class titles to indicate how taxing a class will be. A 30-minute flow where you stand up and sit down multiple times will cost the maximum of three spoons—only attempt on a good day—but a seated breathwork or short bed yoga practice might only cost one spoon and can be slotted into even the most low-energy days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think that with already limited energy, you’d want to spend it on the most fun and fulfilling things possible—eating chocolate, fussing over a pet, or cuddling a partner, but when you're only spending spoons on those things, self-care tends to slip off the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd explains that even a gentle &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-yoga-teacher-recommends-doing-this-one-thing-before-you-start-your-day-to-tune-into-your-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-yoga-teacher-recommends-doing-this-one-thing-before-you-start-your-day-to-tune-into-your-body"&gt;10-minute breathwork practice&lt;/a&gt; when you wake up encourages you to check in with your body, breathe consciously and mentally check in with yourself, which is a basic, but valuable act of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process can help you to better understand your condition, your pain and your capacity, and how these things may vary from day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-drozd-is-a-compassionate-friendly-host"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drozd is a compassionate, friendly host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may just be my personality, but sometimes I just do not gel with online instructors. Drozd is like me—someone with a chronic illness who lives each day within a limited window of energy—and I took to her style of teaching. She gives options for most movements and always encourages users to take it slowly and only do what is comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, when yoga is recommended by health professionals, it’s given some sort of mystical quality and you find yourself thinking “oh, maybe this will fix me.” Drozd and I have both experienced this, but she was extremely clear: yoga will not fix your condition, but it may help you to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF-9Y01Nc6YbQOlbVh0PaPf5WSIRN4BeiqG" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF-9Y01Nc6YbQOlbVh0PaPf5WSIRN4BeiqG slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Sophia Drozd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.instagram.com/yogaforpainapp/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="INSTAGRAM"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon_instagram" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" fill="#de3073" r="12"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M18.958 9.116a5.121 5.121 0 00-.336-1.708 3.557 3.557 0 00-2.044-2.044 5.12 5.12 0 00-1.694-.322C14.142 5.014 13.89 5 12 5s-2.142.014-2.884.042a5.213 5.213 0 00-1.708.322 3.665 3.665 0 00-2.044 2.044 5.213 5.213 0 00-.322 1.708C5.014 9.858 5 10.1 5 12s.014 2.142.042 2.884a5.12 5.12 0 00.322 1.694 3.44 3.44 0 00.812 1.246 3.4 3.4 0 001.232.8 5.175 5.175 0 001.708.336c.742.028.98.042 2.884.042s2.142-.014 2.884-.042a5.082 5.082 0 001.694-.336 3.456 3.456 0 002.044-2.044 5.006 5.006 0 00.336-1.694C18.986 14.142 19 13.9 19 12s-.014-2.142-.042-2.884zM17.7 14.828a3.946 3.946 0 01-.252 1.3 2.189 2.189 0 01-.518.8 2.165 2.165 0 01-.8.532 4.641 4.641 0 01-1.3.238c-.742.028-.966.042-2.828.042s-2.1-.014-2.828-.042a3.837 3.837 0 01-1.3-.252A2.258 2.258 0 016.54 16.13a3.91 3.91 0 01-.238-1.3c-.028-.742-.042-.966-.042-2.828s.014-2.086.042-2.828a3.787 3.787 0 01.238-1.3A2.445 2.445 0 017.87 6.54a3.856 3.856 0 011.3-.238c.742-.028.952-.042 2.828-.042s2.086.014 2.828.042a3.787 3.787 0 011.3.238 2.445 2.445 0 011.33 1.33 4.641 4.641 0 01.238 1.3c.027.742.042.952.042 2.828s-.011 2.088-.036 2.83zM12 8.4a3.6 3.6 0 103.6 3.6A3.6 3.6 0 0012 8.4zm.181 5.929a2.338 2.338 0 01-.362-4.662 2.43 2.43 0 01.362 0 2.338 2.338 0 010 4.662zm3.557-6.909a.84.84 0 11-.84.84.84.84 0 01.84-.838z" fill="#fff"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Drozd is the owner and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga for Pain&lt;/a&gt;  (Y4P), and is a qualified yoga teacher, lifelong practitioner and chronic pain warrior.

			&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/"&gt;1.8 billion people&lt;/a&gt; log into TikTok at least once a month, spending an average of 95 minutes per day being engaged, entertained, and even educated by the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are phenomenal numbers, but a new study shows the platform isn't the most reliable source for information, particularly when it comes to health conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="155775" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada found that of the top 100 most-viewed TikTok videos tagged for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;) content, fewer than half matched the professional diagnostic criteria for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos – which had collectively racked up nearly half a billion views in total – were largely based on personal experience and opinion. They often missed the nuances of ADHD, such as the way symptoms can differ between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155778" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg" alt="Word cloud" class="wp-image-155778 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-600x599.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at hashtags related to ADHD posts. (Karasavva et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TikTok can be an incredible tool for raising awareness and reducing stigma, but it also has a downside," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; UBC clinical psychologist Vasileia Karasavva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anecdotes and personal experiences are powerful, but when they lack context, they can lead to misunderstandings about ADHD and mental health in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also ran an experiment using the top 100's five most accurate and five least accurate videos, as judged by clinical psychologists. These 10 clips were then shown to 843 undergraduates taking an introductory psychology course, who were asked to rate them based on their perceived educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the best five videos scored an average of 3.6 from psychologists for accuracy, they only got a score of 2.8 from the students. The worst five videos for accuracy scored 1.1 from psychologists, but 2.3 from students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are clear: there's a significant gap between expert opinions on TikTok's ADHD videos and those of casual viewers. Such potential for misinformation could interfere with the public's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-diagnoses-keep-rising-higher-this-is-why-its-happening"&gt;understanding of the condition&lt;/a&gt;, which could affect how many are diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight a discrepancy between mental health professionals and young adults regarding the psychoeducational value of ADHD content on TikTok," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Addressing this is crucial to improving access to treatment and enhancing support for those with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that students who viewed more ADHD content in general were more likely to share it with others, and that they were more likely to think that ADHD is more common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-adhd-is-more-prevalent-in-adults-than-we-realized"&gt;than it actually is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators on TikTok are rewarded for attracting views rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-analyzed-what-tiktok-says-about-medical-tests-and-got-a-nasty-shock"&gt;providing accurate information&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers point out, and they'd also like to see more expert content from health professionals shared on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't anti-TikTok, and acknowledge its value in building community and reaching young people. But they're also encouraging TikTok viewers to look for other, more reputable sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some young adults turn to TikTok because of access barriers, or negative experiences they have had with mental health professionals," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Amori Mikami, a professor of psychology at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic diseases related to inflammation are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regularly walking can help tame inflammation by reducing inflammatory markers in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 150 minutes of walking per week, divided into one or two sessions daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The silver lining? You can reduce inflammation by lacing up your sneakers. Keep reading to find our 7-day walking plan designed to reduce inflammation. We’ll also chat with certified personal trainers who explain how walking can help and how much you need to walk for the best results.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-your-walking-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Your Walking Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree the ultimate goal is to work (or, shall we say, &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt;) your way up to at least 150 minutes each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And consistency is key to achieving this goal. It’s far better to do a 10-minute walk 3 to 4 times a week than overexert yourself with one long, hard one-hour long and then skip the rest of the week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, you can also break down your walking sessions into shorter intervals throughout the day. For example, you could walk for 15 minutes in the morning and another 15 minutes in the evening instead of aiming for one 30-minute block. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you feel more confident and seasoned, you can slowly dial up the duration of each walk by adding 5 minutes daily. You can also challenge yourself by walking up some hills or increasing the incline on a treadmill to make it steeper. Another way to spice things up is interval walking: alternate between 5 minutes of brisk walking and 5 minutes at a slower pace, then repeat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For any beginners new to walking for exercise, here’s an example of what your 7-day walking plan could look like: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walking-helps-reduce-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walking Helps Reduce Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking doesn’t just help you meet your daily step count; it can also lead to better blood flow and circulation throughout the body. “As more oxygen and nutrients are carried to working tissues, this helps repair tissues, reducing damage caused by inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/elizabeth-shaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified personal trainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Increased blood flow serves multiple functions. It helps deliver nutrients to where they are needed while also removing pro-inflammatory cells. “When circulation is increased, it helps to remove toxins and waste from the body,” &lt;a href="https://www.pennwest.edu/about/directory/hatton_m.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa A. Hatton, M.S., NASM-CPT&lt;/a&gt;, faculty member in the Exercise, Health and Sport Sciences department at Pennsylvania Western University,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with improved circulation, walking also helps lower inflammatory markers, explains Shaw. In particular, it reduces CRP (C-reactive protein), a marker of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hatton notes that exercise, such as walking, helps to reduce excess body fat, which &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7901433/surprising-link-between-chronic-inflammation-obesity/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;is linked to chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that individuals with more active lifestyles experience significant reductions in inflammatory markers compared to those who are sedentary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet another reason to break out your sneakers!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise also triggers the release of anti-inflammatory cells. &lt;a href="https://www.nasm.org/darlene-marshall-sme?srsltid=AfmBOorIUEYaDoW3-fHDZdwA5sk7ldD7LWnvc7hsUgj5MW9RJr-tKWAl" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Darlene Marshall, NASM-CWC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a certified personal trainer, explains that when our muscles contract, they release cytokines—proteins with anti-inflammatory benefits that circulate throughout the body after exercise, helping to tame inflammation. Although you can’t see them, they are busy floating in our blood after exercise and working to reduce inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For individuals with metabolic diseases like diabetes and high cholesterol, Marshall points out that movement, like walking, helps lower inflammation by utilizing excess resources, such as high blood sugar. Elevated blood sugar levels can increase inflammation, but walking regularly can help tackle this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 12-week study on postmenopausal women with obesity found that those who followed a consistent walking plan experienced a significant decrease in not only inflammatory markers but also weight and body fat percentage. This further proves that walking helps lower inflammation and supports the rest of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you’re looking for a way to boost your mood, walking can also make you smile. Marshall explains that releasing endorphins can make you more sensitive to positive emotions, helping you feel happier. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-to-walk-for-lower-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much to Walk for Lower Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Any and all forms and amounts of walking will be a step in the right direction for reducing inflammation and improving your health,” says Shaw. She points to research showing that adults over 60 years old who walked between 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day saw positive health changes, while adults under 60 who logged between 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day also experienced health improvements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Showing any amount of walking at any age can really help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Intensity matters, too. Marshall recommends aiming for moderate or high-intensity levels because that’s when cytokine activation occurs. She says, “That's going to be a different pace for each of us, but generally, you can walk like you're late for an important appointment.” That means you should be breathing heavily but still hold a conversation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research confirms you have to be consistent with exercise to see a decrease in inflammation, as only regular, moderate and intense physical activity has anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, excessive exercise can do the opposite and lead to heightened levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that, technically, you can walk too much. Hatton warns, “You can also overdo it with a walking plan, which can actually cause inflammation. Anytime you overexert or overtrain, the body reacts to the stressor.” She recommends walking at a moderate pace, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-electrolyte-drink-8785287" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;staying hydrated&lt;/a&gt; and listening to your body. If you are tired or sore, take a day off to recover. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you start to feel bold or adventurous, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013593/health-benefits-of-walking-backward/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking backwards may provide even greater benefits&lt;/a&gt;. “A recent study showed that walking backwards on a treadmill, also known as ‘retro-walking,’ demonstrated more favorable results for lowering cardiovascular disease risk, including markers for inflammation,” notes Shaw.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, she notes that this may not be everyone, and that’s okay, so stick to what you feel comfortable with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you walk forwards or backwards, maintaining a consistent walking plan at a moderate pace is the best action plan for walking to reduce inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To lower inflammation, take more steps. Research shows that regular walking can help reduce inflammatory markers, improve circulation, support metabolic health, improve body composition and even boost your mood. The key is to be consistent and walk your way up to meeting 150 minutes per week.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

with mental health, admitting that she suffered from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-81273eb0-05f3-11f0-a3b7-971a21fb6f21"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for years and battled postpartum depression after giving birth.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day of the shocking deaths, Harshman had clonazepam in her system, which is prescribed to help panic disorders and epilepsy. It can be recognized under the brand name Klonopin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clonazepam is a sedative and has side effects including paranoia, suicidal ideation, and impairment of judgement, coordination, and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketamine is an anesthetic which can have hallucinogenic effects. The drug is only &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-1f0a9a00-05ea-11f0-91d7-7d511c582b9a"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approved as an anesthetic, but not to treat mental health disorders, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-ketamine"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day she died, Harshman  called emergency services and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14395903/Call-Traneyelle-Harshman-shooting-daughters.html"&gt;reported that her daughters had been shot&lt;/a&gt; and were dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tranyelle Harshman, 32, killed herself and her four children on February 10 in Wyoming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cliff Harshman told local news that even though he was angry with his wife for taking their children from them, he still grieved her and loved her &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harshman and her four children Brailey, 9, Brooke, who was almost three, and Jordan, 2 died after sustaining gunshot wounds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harshman then said that she was planning on doing the same to herself, and hung up the phone despite pleas from the 911 operator to stay on the line until emergency crews arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom told the dispatcher that she couldn't stay on the line and said it was 'too late,' according to the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, law enforcement responded to the scene and found Brooke and Jordan dead in their cribs while Brailey was found with a gunshot wound in a downstairs bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olivia and Harshman were transported to a local hospital with signs of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harshman died two days later in hospital. Olivia, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14404017/Wyoming-girl-Olivia-Blackmer-dies-mother-Tranyelle-Harsshman-murder-suicide.html"&gt;died at a hospital in Salt Lake City,&lt;/a&gt; Utah, five days after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traynelle's husband, Cliff, was on a business trip and the girls were home sick with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia died at a hospital in Salt Lake City after her sister, Brailey, was found dead in their home &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia's biological father and stepmom announced her death in an update on an online fundraiser days after the murder-suicide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The shocking events occurred in the small town of Byron, Wyoming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their toxicology reports, as first reviewed by local news outlet, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/03/20/byron-mom-in-murder-suicide-had-depression-anxiety-meds-in-system/"&gt;Cowboy State Daily&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that the children who died at the scene had 'unusual large amounts of Propanolol – beta-blocker – and Diphenhydramine – antihistamine which causes drowsiness – in their systems.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is a key ingredient in the brand-name allergy drug, Benadryl. Propranolol is a prescription beta-blocker that can treat high blood pressure, chest pain, migraines, and tremors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug can result in side effects such as slow or uneven heartbeats, lightheadedness, trouble breathing, sudden weakness, depression, heart problems, or low blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear why the girls were on the medications, but Cliff told Cowboy State Daily that his wife's chemical mental health treatments were her last hope to cope with her mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm bitter that this has had to continue to be a thorn in my side, when I need to just… grieve my family's loss,' Cliff said on the questions he's been pestered with since the tragedy rocked his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also want people to understand that this isn't a chance to demonize different therapies. This works for a lot of different people,' he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was her last grasp at the rope, if you will, to hang on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Law enforcement responded to the home just minutes after Harshman called 911 and reported her daughters deaths &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia and Brailey, the two oldest daughters who died in the murder-suicide, pictured with their biological father Quinn Blackmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff told the outlet that he went to visit his wife in the hospital after the murder-suicide and prayed for the strength to forgive  her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that he was working on accepting that his family was gone and wanted to focus on grieving instead of defending them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff was the biological father of the two younger girls, Brooke and Jordan, but raised Olivia and Brailey for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olivia and Brailey's biological father, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14405313/heartbroken-dad-breaks-silence-daughter-died-mother-murder-suicide.html"&gt;Quinn Blackmer, and his wife Katelynn announced&lt;/a&gt; that Olivia had died after fighting in the hospital for days after she was shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Olivia is with her sisters now. She gained her angel wings yesterday at 3.49pm.

It's a chemical imbalance,' he said. 'And it can be exacerbated by trying to fix it with medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff added that her violent actions were 'so out of character' and what happened was 'unbelievable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As angry as I may be with her, I still love her - and I still lost her as well,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOOUlnY044V3RxeHVMNDBEUUhzZGExTGs1WGNPRTdlVTFiQXk4WmF2emEzNjFHTDZhdmJLaGRFZHp5eXhIQWp0TkpyRTJnMjZPb2Qyd2FTR0NyQVAtVFpuT0RWMkRnTXBzX1AtdVNMNE5ZR3dGbm8yeXFsX2JobWM2VHMxaXJBUHNoZUVaZEk2aFR4Y3JZdS1qcGdUajZtWlhiQnRpQmxUYnMtc0p6VEVz0gG0AUFVX3lxTE0tdzJET2ozWWpYbjFfU1hHN2lrbmNoWnk5ZEFENkxBMW92akk4dHRqbFlQUkhZbVBvQ3dPMy1JdkxCV3l2N1lZMnlPSzZ1SHJKRGoybWJTX0kwTXF1bjFYdi16Q2RuSDUxMTJsWHZFaW1TNTBkcnQ1cDlHUFV3dFpJakFIbWdaZnBwTmdZTHZmb0pDbmUxQTF1UDZTbmxDb1hKS1ZZOVVJREVkZVlUcW5ick9wWQ</guid></item><item><title>Trump’s Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZ3drMEFQQThPdWtvMWZ3aVJuQTZZTlE2em9Xelp5eFU5RG4xUnhPbG5zZWttelFSVUdwNHVFMXB4LTZpUm55VUVUMXhUUVlPSW9VZGREcHdqdjhLLVZkMnAzSE5sVFZiNjZ3cTNNY3pUX1hZbk8xTGdYb1Fya1lDWG40MGhzYjJXdlhlSDYtZHlYa1dDNExHVE1sdGhmcllqUEU2MlJjdXNoV2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-right-rail__main-interior-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="c-overline b-overline TDB" href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1 class="b-headline"&gt;Trump‚Äôs Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="c-heading b-subheadline"&gt;In an op-ed, Dr. Jerome Adams noted that Kennedy‚Äôs legacy will depend more on what he does about the measles outbreak now than his words in the past.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="c-grid b-double-chain__children-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain__child-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="Article-byline--single-author"&gt;&lt;p class="PublicationTime"&gt;&lt;time class="PublicationTime__pub-time" datetime="March 20, 2025 at 9:31PM EDT"&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date-label"&gt;Published¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date"&gt;Mar. 20 2025¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__time"&gt;9:31PM EDT¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="b-lead-art"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="c0fDzxgXCT3g12H" data-fusion-collection="chains" data-fusion-type="article-body" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [chains:article-body]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Short-author-bio-tips"&gt;&lt;p class="Short-author-bio-tips__tip"&gt;Got a tip?

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas parents of an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl who died from measles Feb. 26 told the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense this week that the experience did not convince them that vaccination against measles was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She says they would still say ‘Don’t do the shots,’ ” an unidentified translator for the parents said. “They think it’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple, members of a Mennonite community in Gaines County, spoke on camera in both English and Low German to CHD Executive Director Polly Tommey and CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was her time on Earth,” the translator said the parents told her. “They believe she’s better off where she is now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said in English, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination children typically receive before attending school. She said her stance on vaccination has not changed after her daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it pretty quickly,” the mother said of her other four surviving children who were treated with castor oil and inhaled steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple told CHD that their daughter had measles for days when she became tired and the girl’s labored breathing prompted the couple to take her to Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. There, the girl was intubated and died a few days later. The other children came down with measles after their sister died.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt; parents’ interview&lt;/a&gt; was posted on the website of Children’s Health Defense, an organization founded in 2007 by Robert F.
