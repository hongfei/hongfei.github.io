&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/mental-health/national-study-mental-health-and-wellbeing/2020-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in five Australian men&lt;/a&gt; at some point in their lives. But the condition remains highly stigmatized, misunderstood and underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Men are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3135672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder compared to women. Some feel pressure to be fearless and hide their emotions. Others simply don’t understand or have the language to describe anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has serious consequences. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our latest research&lt;/a&gt; shows young men are turning to ambulance services when their symptoms become overwhelming – some even think they’re having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do so many men wait until they need to call emergency services, rather than seek support earlier from a doctor or psychologist? And what prompts them to call? We reviewed the paramedic notes of 694 men aged 15 to 25 years in Victoria, Australia, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-young-men-haven-t-seen-others-asking-for-help"&gt;Young Men Haven’t Seen Others Asking For Help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boys are raised to value courage, strength and self-assurance, and to suppress vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When parents encourage boys to “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735809000671?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;face their fears&lt;/a&gt;,” rather than offering emotional comfort and tenderness, anxiety gets positioned in conflict &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/masculinity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with masculinity&lt;/a&gt;. This leads to a disjuncture between the support young men are met with (and come to expect) from others, and the support they may want or need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This also means boys grow up believing their male role models – dads, brothers, grandads, coaches – don’t get anxious, deterring boys and men from seeking help. As a result, anxiety goes undiagnosed and opportunities for early intervention are missed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have seen positive shifts challenging restrictive masculine stereotypes. This has improved awareness surrounding &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/depression-fathers-children-genetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s depression&lt;/a&gt; – opening up conversations, normalizing help-seeking and leading to the development of &lt;a href="https://headsupguys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s mental health programs and resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, men’s anxiety remains in the shadows. When anxiety is talked about, it’s not with the same weight or concern as depression. This is despite men’s anxiety having harmful &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15516548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health impacts&lt;/a&gt; including turning to alcohol and drugs to cope, and increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access-pdfs/gender-differences-in-suicidal-risk-factors-among-individuals-with-mood-disorders-2167-1044-1000218.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;male suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-anxiety-look-like"&gt;What Does Anxiety Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When men are encouraged to talk about anxiety, they describe various challenges including repetitive worries, feeling out-of-control and intense physical symptoms. This includes a high heart rate, shortness of breath, body pains, tremors and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/headaches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jack Steele, a prominent Australian personality and one half of the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/theinspiredunemployed/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inspired Unemployed&lt;/a&gt;, opened up about his anxiety difficulties on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxAx0kOOAo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Imperfects Podcast&lt;/a&gt; last year saying:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what anxiety was. I thought I was the opposite of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way I explain it, it’s like […] your whole body just shuts down. My throat starts closing up and my whole body just goes numb. […] It feels like you’re just so alone. You feel like no-one can help you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You genuinely think the world’s ending – like there’s no out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;







&lt;p&gt;These physical symptoms are common in men but can be frequently dismissed rather than recognized as anxiety. Our research has found that, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;when left unaddressed&lt;/a&gt;, these symptoms typically worsen and arise in more and more contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-anxious-men-call-ambulances"&gt;Why Do Anxious Men Call Ambulances?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our new study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the consequences of men’s anxiety going unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, we used data from the &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Ambulance Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt; to identify and describe the types of anxiety young men experience. We then looked at the characteristics and contexts of young men’s anxiety presentations to ambulance services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed and lacking support, many young men turn to ambulances in crisis. Anxiety now accounts for &lt;a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/turning-point-website-prod/drupal-s3fs/s3fs-public/inline-files/Beyond%20the%20emergency%20WEB_FINAL_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10% of male ambulance attendances&lt;/a&gt; for mental health concerns, surpassing depression and psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While every presentation is different, our study identified three common presentations among young men:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sudden onset of intense bodily symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; resembling life-threatening physical health conditions such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Joshua, for example, whose case files we reviewed as part of our study, was on a tram home from work when he experienced sudden numbness in his hands and feet. A bystander saw he was having muscle spasms in his hands. Joshua was alert but extremely anxious and asked the bystander for help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Severe anxiety triggered or worsened by substance use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam, a 21-year-old man, consumed a substantial amount of diazepam (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/safest-way-to-take-valium-ativan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valium&lt;/a&gt;) while driving home, after having an anxiety attack at work. Adam reached out to paramedics because he was concerned his anxiety symptoms hadn’t dissipated, and was worried he may have taken too much diazepam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mental health deterioration with self-harm or suicidal thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;, often tied to situational stressors such as unstable housing, unemployment, financial difficulties and relationship strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo, aged 25, had been increasingly anxious for the past three days. Leo’s parents called an ambulance after he told them he wanted to kill himself. Leo told paramedics on arrival that he still felt suicidal and had been getting worse over the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-directing-resources-where-they-re-needed"&gt;Directing Resources Where They’re Needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Young men’s anxiety presentations are time- and resource-intensive for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543663/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom feel poorly equipped to respond effectively. After ruling out physical causes, paramedic support is typically limited to reassurance and breathing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most young men are then instructed to follow up with GPs, psychologists or other health professionals in the general community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But taking that next step involves overcoming the stigma associated with help-seeking, the shame of having called an ambulance and deep tensions between anxiety and what it means to be a man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means many young men slip through the cracks. And without ongoing mental health support, they face high risks of presenting again to emergency services with increasingly severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ramp up conversations about men’s anxiety and take their experiences seriously&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;develop an awareness campaign about men’s anxiety. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l8GOz4a9WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Awareness campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/39/4/daae104/7748055?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; dismantled stigma and shed light on men’s depression and suicide&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;improve diagnosis of men’s anxiety disorders by up-skilling and &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-28138-001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; clinicians to detect anxiety and the unique and distinct constellations of symptoms in men&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;create accessible pathways to early support through digital psychological education resources, focused on improving awareness and literacy surrounding men’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The research found that both partnered sex and solo masturbation reduced the amount of time people spent awake during the night and improved overall sleep efficiency. These effects were not reflected in subjective reports of sleep quality, but objective sleep monitoring showed consistent improvements following sexual activity compared to nights without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people believe that orgasm has a relaxing effect and promotes sleep, most existing evidence has relied on subjective reports. Only one study—conducted more than three decades ago—had attempted to objectively measure sleep following sexual activity, and it had significant design limitations. The present research aimed to address this gap by using a portable brain-monitoring device to measure sleep stages and sleep quality in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been investigating sleep behaviors in the adult population for several years, while this has predominantly focused on improving the sleep behaviors of elite athletes, I am always asked various questions about sleep,” said study author Michele Lastella, a senior lecturer at CQUniversity Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A frequent question asked ‘how come my partner falls asleep straight away after sex and I can’t’ and I thought if people are frequently asking me questions about this, then this must be indicative that there is a real lack of research evidence around it. One of the main reasons it hadn’t previously been explored in depth was related to the taboo associated with people being afraid to talk about sex. When people would ask question, a lot of the time it was associated with the males falling asleep and the women weren’t, and I thought this may be something related to the orgasm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is part of a broader research effort investigating the relationship between sex and sleep. Earlier work Lastella and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveyed 778 people and found&lt;/a&gt; that both men and women perceived that sex with orgasm helped them fall asleep faster and sleep better. These findings prompted the current study, which provides a more detailed and objective look at how sexual activity influences sleep physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited seven heterosexual couples, comprising 14 participants in total, all of whom were healthy, sexually active, and living together in South Australia. Participants were screened to ensure they had no sleep disorders, were not pregnant, and did not have children, which could affect sleep routines. All participants reported engaging in sexual activity at least twice a week. The final sample consisted of 7 males and 7 females, each around 26 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were monitored over 11 consecutive nights using a repeated-measures, crossover design. Each couple completed nights in three different conditions: no sexual activity, solo masturbation (with orgasm), and partnered sex (with orgasm). To measure sleep objectively, participants wore a wireless polysomnographic device (DREEM3 headband), which recorded brain activity, movement, and breathing during the night. Participants also completed self-report diaries each morning, detailing their sexual activity, sleep quality, mood, and readiness for the upcoming day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On nights when participants engaged in sexual activity, they went to bed later than on nights with no sex. However, they also spent significantly less time awake after falling asleep and had higher sleep efficiency, meaning they spent a greater proportion of their time in bed actually sleeping. Sleep efficiency was 93.2% following solo masturbation and 93.4% after partnered sex, compared to 91.5% on nights with no sexual activity. Participants spent about 7 minutes less awake during the night following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the improvements in sleep were evident only in the objective data. Participants did not report significant differences in how well they thought they had slept across the three conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that engaging in sexual activity regardless of whether it was solo masturbation or partnered sexual activity, improved objective sleep quality by reducing the amount of time spent awake throughout the night and improved overall sleep efficiency,” Lastella told PsyPost. “There were no differences in sleep duration, sleep latency and subjective sleep measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they did report feeling more motivated and ready for the day following partnered sex. On average, participants rated their motivation and readiness 8–11 points higher (on a 100-point scale) after a night of partnered sex compared to nights without sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect the study examined was how sexual activity might influence the synchronization of sleep stages between partners, known as sleep stage concordance. Previous studies have shown that couples who share a bed tend to enter REM sleep at similar times, suggesting that cosleeping can influence sleep patterns. This study found that REM sleep stage concordance was significantly longer when couples slept together—regardless of whether they had engaged in sex—compared to when they slept alone. This suggests that the act of cosleeping itself may promote synchronized REM sleep, potentially due to shared environmental and physiological cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific sleep stages, the researchers found that participants spent more time in the lightest stage of sleep (N1) on nights without sexual activity. While the difference—about 2 minutes—was statistically significant, it is unlikely to have clinical significance. Other stages of sleep, including deep sleep (N3) and REM sleep, did not show significant differences across the three conditions, although there were trends suggesting some improvements following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous research. For example, a 2023 study published in the Journal of Sleep Research used a 14-day diary method and found that partnered sex with &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/partnered-sexual-activity-with-orgasm-improves-sleep-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;orgasm was associated with shorter time to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt; and better self-reported sleep quality. However, that study did not include objective sleep measures and found inconsistent results for solo masturbation. The current study supports the idea that orgasm, regardless of whether it occurs alone or with a partner, may have sleep-promoting effects—but these effects are more clearly captured through objective measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors suggest that hormonal changes following orgasm could explain the observed benefits to sleep. Orgasm is known to increase the release of oxytocin and prolactin while reducing cortisol levels. Oxytocin, often called the “bonding hormone,” has been linked to lower stress and better sleep, while prolactin is associated with sexual satisfaction and relaxation. These hormonal shifts may reduce arousal and promote a smoother transition into restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study had several limitations. The sample was small, consisting of only 14 participants, all of whom were healthy heterosexual couples. This limits the ability to generalize the findings to broader populations, such as older adults, people with sleep disorders, or those in non-heterosexual relationships. The participants also had to activate their sleep monitoring devices after sexual activity, which may have interfered with the natural transition into sleep and reduced the chance of capturing very short sleep onset latencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the main challenges is setting up the device to record following sexual activity, as in an ideal real world scenario individuals would be able to simply attempt to sleep following sexual activity without having to activate/record on a device,” Lastella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was the potential for social desirability bias in self-reported measures. While the objective data were less susceptible to this, participants might have felt inclined to rate their sleep or sexual experiences more positively. The researchers note that future studies should aim to include a more diverse and larger sample and should explore whether sexual activity could be used as a behavioral intervention for people with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are actively seeking funding to support our third part of the investigation recruiting a larger sample with participants with poor sleep quality or behaviours and examine if sexual activity can help subsequent sleep behavior,” Lastella said. “This type of research is important as it provide us with a non-pharmaceutical approach toward improving not only sleep behavior but health and wellbeing as a collective. Please reach out if this research interests you, and there are funding opportunities that might support this type of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2024.11.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep on it: A pilot study exploring the impact of sexual activity on sleep outcomes in cohabiting couples&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michele Lastella, Dean J.

On any given day, there’s coverage of a&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-05-approach-aggressive-breast-cancers-significant.html"&gt; new treatment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27pdz4g23o"&gt;screening method&lt;/a&gt;, or a rousing story of an &lt;a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/major-league-baseball-celebrates-mother-s-day-2025"&gt;athlete’s awareness efforts&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://people.com/katie-thurston-doing-the-best-i-can-amid-breast-cancer-exclusive-11734603"&gt;celebrity fighting bravely&lt;/a&gt;. But last fall, a breast-cancer narrative of a different ilk briefly claimed headlines: In the span of six weeks, two famous breast-cancer patients shared publicly that they had declined parts of their doctors’ treatment recommendations and chosen alternative approaches instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nj001c3b6dnr6ncu8l@published" data-word-count="182"&gt;One was former MTV VJ &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/new-york-it-girl-history.html"&gt;Ananda Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58bOXgeOnFA"&gt;CNN roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt;, she said her stage-three breast cancer diagnosed in January 2019 had progressed to stage four, which meant it was now incurable. Lewis said she had declined a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and had opted instead for lifestyle changes like detoxes and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in combination with high-dose vitamin C IVs — at least at first. “I decided to keep my tumor and try to work it out of my body a different way,” she said to CNN correspondent Stephanie Elam. The other was model Elle Macpherson. In a September interview with an &lt;a href="https://www.womensweekly.com.au/news/elle-macpherson-now/"&gt;Australian women’s magazine&lt;/a&gt;, she said she’d been diagnosed with stage-zero breast cancer and was now in remission. Though she had a lumpectomy, she &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/elle-macpherson-breast-cancer-treatment.html"&gt;refused additional therapies&lt;/a&gt;, including chemotherapy and radiation, that her doctors recommended. “I chose a holistic approach,” she wrote in her memoir, &lt;em&gt;elle&lt;/em&gt;, published in November. “Saying no to standard medical solutions was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But saying no to my own inner sense would have been even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9m0000m3b6djyrkng5l@published" data-word-count="15"&gt;Their stories are far from the norm, but they still speak to a broader trend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9m8000n3b6dfqjbmmz5@published" data-word-count="204"&gt;Scientific advancements in breast-cancer treatment occur with remarkable regularity. From 2010 to 2020, the FDA approved 30 medications for breast cancer, and in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2813878"&gt;a 2024 &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on breast-cancer mortality, the authors estimate that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a new trial in breast cancer is added to ClinicalTrials.gov every day. These developments have saved at least half a million lives. From 1989 to 2022, the breast-cancer death rate &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21863"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; by 44 percent. Currently, the overall five-year &lt;a href="https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-facts/"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt; for breast cancer is 91 percent, and those diagnosed with the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5833304/"&gt;most severe form&lt;/a&gt; of the disease are living longer than ever before. And yet, despite all of this, not every breast-cancer patient opts for the most effective treatment modalities. This may be because breast-cancer care has become more varied and multipronged at a time when information — and misinformation — has never been more accessible, and when distrust in physicians is rapidly increasing, especially among Republicans. Thirty-four percent of them told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 2022 they had “not too much” or “no confidence at all” that medical scientists were working toward the public’s best interests. That figure has tripled since January 2019. In other words: Why trust a doctor when you can fact-check them instead?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mz000w3b6dmg9rc325@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;“People can come to these conversations with preconceived notions about the effectiveness of these treatments and whether they should do them,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/skyler-b-johnson"&gt;Skyler Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute. “I get the sense that they feel like they know more than me, that I’m more of an enemy than a counterpart trying to help.” Some, particularly those interested in natural healing methods, are wary of conventional therapies — especially chemotherapy and radiation — and their brutal reputation. (There is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29237009/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/15/cancer-radiation-therapy-decreased-use/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that use of both therapies is declining, though chemotherapy is still &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/treatment/breast_cancer"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; in more than half of breast-cancer patients whose disease has spread to the lymph nodes.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mn000q3b6dqebzbaos@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;For more than ten years, Johnson has &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/alternative-medicine-cancer-survival"&gt;studied&lt;/a&gt; people who forgo conventional cancer treatments in favor of unproven treatments. In one of his studies, the breast-cancer patients who made such a decision had a 470 percent increased risk of death in the following five years. He’s hesitant, at first, to say what’s changed in the decade since he began this line of research; social media was around a decade ago, after all. “But I can tell you that the patient behavior has changed,” he said, referring to worsening distrust in doctors and in the health-care system at large. “And I think it’s changed in a way that is likely going to lead to the adoption of more unproven cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ni001b3b6d67b2xngx@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;Today, close to half of Americans have used alternative medicine, ranging from herbal remedies to chiropractic and acupuncture. In 2017, about 20 percent told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; that they’d turned to alternative methods instead of conventional medical care. The practice is especially popular in cancer care. An estimated 50 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine in addition to conventional treatment. It’s harder to pinpoint how many people may be using alternative care &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of standard care, in part because these patients may not be in contact with the health-care system. But, anecdotally, stories about celebrities choosing this route seems to have an impact on the larger patient population. &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-joe-rogan-ivermectin-fenbendazole-cancer-podcast-2013180"&gt;In January,&lt;/a&gt; Mel Gibson went on Joe Rogan’s podcast and said three of his friends had been cured of their stage-four cancers after taking ivermectin and fenbendazole (an anti-parasitic). Since then, Johnson said, “This is not an exaggeration: I am fielding a question about ivermectin currently once a week.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mt000v3b6diabxhn41@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;Personal stories and recommendations wield power too. When Amber Jones, who is in her early 40s and lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed with breast cancer, a friend told her to look up Josh Axe, a practitioner of natural medicine and chiropractic. Axe &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJJ_Q0luTaT/"&gt;often shares&lt;/a&gt; his mother’s cancer-recovery story, which he attributes to natural healing methods. “He’s the reason,” Jones said. “He’s the reason I had the courage to do what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9s8001w3b6dmmyzjm7j@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;In 2022, when she was 38, she had an abnormal Pap smear that turned out to be cervical cancer. Her doctors recommended a radical &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/why-lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-is-unusual.html"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt;, which would remove nearly all of her reproductive organs (her surgeon would leave one ovary, so as not to send her into early menopause) as well as the surrounding tissue. She was terrified of the diagnosis and complied without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n0000y3b6d7zph3tbk@published" data-word-count="26"&gt;“It all happened so fast,” said Jones. “And then you get through the other side … and you just realize, &lt;em&gt;Holy shit, I just had cancer.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nn001e3b6dsef7uo68@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;The surgery was a success: Follow-up tests showed no sign of cancer. But it left her reeling. Recovery was difficult, and it took her six months to feel physically functional again. The emotional impact lingered even longer. “You hear the word cancer the first time, and you think, &lt;em&gt;I’m going to die&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. Within a day of her diagnosis, she started organizing her finances, going so far as to make her teenage daughter the beneficiary of her bank account. “It was just really, really emotionally traumatizing,” she said. “And that feeling didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ms000t3b6dy93lst0s@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;She decided to make some lifestyle changes. She made her own deodorant and planted an organic garden in her backyard. (It has required getting creative when it comes to controlling bugs: “There’s some particular bugs that you just have to hand-pick off,” she said.) She began to drink reverse-osmosis-filtered water, eat grass-fed meats from regeneratively raised farms, and take methylated vitamins. “I fired my cleaning people and was like, &lt;em&gt;I’m doing this myself, old school — baking soda, vinegar&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. “I stopped &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-dye-your-hair.html"&gt;dyeing my hair&lt;/a&gt; and going to salons. I stopped doing my nails.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nw001f3b6diif04rzg@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;And then, after all that, in 2024, Jones received a second cancer diagnosis. She had triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease that grows and spreads more quickly than other types. She was 40 years old now, with a husband and two teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mt000u3b6dmyh8d1io@published" data-word-count="9"&gt;This time, she wanted her treatment to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ml000p3b6di5wyducz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The cancer was stage one, which meant it was still &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/triple-negative-breast-cancer-5-things-you-should-know.h00-158986656.html"&gt;curable&lt;/a&gt;, and her medical team recommended surgery to remove the tumor, plus chemotherapy and radiation to lessen the chance of recurrence. But Jones didn’t want to do any of that. She’d just worked so hard to build her body back up after the hysterectomy. To her, the thought of another surgery, plus chemo and radiation, meant potentially undoing it all. “I just believed boosting my body and my immune system would serve me better,” she said. She expressed her hesitancy toward the suggested treatments at her first appointment with her medical oncologist, who was alarmed. But Jones dug in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200123b6d0kg81dck@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;“Because that was the mistake I made with my first cancer,” she said. “I probably should have fought a little bit harder for myself and not done what I was told to.” Soon after her second diagnosis, Jones began to follow a few alternative-wellness influencers, including Axe and &lt;a href="https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/about/"&gt;Chris Wark&lt;/a&gt;, who declined chemotherapy after surgery for stage-3C colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ou001m3b6dv2xnmzrz@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;Despite her initial hesitation about the surgery, Jones eventually relented on it; getting the cancer out of her body felt like the right thing to do. Afterward, her pathology report showed no sign of disease. “There was not one cancer cell,” she said. “Everything was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9q7001q3b6d0cgi0k8e@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;A week later, Jones again met with her oncologist via telehealth and expressed her relief at the outcome, assuming it would mean no need for chemotherapy and radiation. Actually, her oncologist said, she did still need both to reduce the risk of recurrence. Jones couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mq000s3b6dtjgucu10@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;“I was like, &lt;em&gt;Excuse me? Are you crazy?&lt;/em&gt;” she said. “Like, why are you going to blast my body and destroy my immune system?” If the cancer did return — and at the time, Jones was confident that it wouldn’t — she reasoned that she would need a healthy immune system to fight it. Chemotherapy can be &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/immune-system/cancer-treatments/chemotherapy"&gt;especially destructive&lt;/a&gt; to white blood cells, which can make patients more vulnerable to disease and infection. “Why would you subject me to that if I don’t need it? How do you know I need it?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mp000r3b6d24gko83w@published" data-word-count="16"&gt;Jones ended the call. That appointment was last summer, and she hasn’t seen her oncologist since.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it is still &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/when-is-it-needed"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for those with breast cancer that is at a higher risk of recurring or spreading. Side effects are common, though their severity &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/chemotherapy/chemotherapy-side-effects.html"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; from person to person. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10226821/#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%2097.4%20%25%20(,%25%20(n=25)."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 97 percent of patients reported at least one side effect; fatigue was most commonly reported, followed by loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, Reandeau stayed on the treatment course recommended by her doctor, even though it was rough. “We did numerous different types of chemotherapy, because I kept having allergic reactions,” she said. “I would get the chemo, and then I would have reactions to it, and then they would have to pump me full of steroids to stop the reactions from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

Every day, she consumed soursop tea, apricot kernels, turkey-tail mushroom tablets, and muscadine-juice concentrate to treat her cancer, even though her medical team had told her not to take supplements because they could worsen the side effects or weaken the efficacy of the chemo. (Johnson estimates that one in three patients who use unproven treatments don’t inform their medical team.) “They say you can eat and drink and do whatever you want, but don’t take any supplements,” she said. “Like, you can eat hot dogs, hamburgers, you can have as much ice cream as you want. But don’t take soursop. And I’m like, &lt;em&gt;Well, that doesn’t really seem to make a lot of sense&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

Like usual, her mom took her home afterward, where Reandeau lived alone. “And everything seemed normal,” she said. “And then about a week went by, and I don’t remember pretty much the entire week.”&lt;/p&gt;

Once, she woke up in the bathroom at two or three in the morning, with no memory of how she got there, and found herself surrounded by her own vomit and feces. Her sister took her back to the oncologist, who said she was neutropenic. She was too out of it to know what drugs she received as treatment (“steroids and liquids and all different kinds of medication”), but within a few hours, she was feeling better. Her doctors suggested lessening the chemotherapy dosage, but she had already made up her mind. She would have surgery and rounds of radiation, but she was steadfast in her chemo decision.&lt;/p&gt;

It is treatable, and we have a lot of treatments that can work for a very long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n500163b6dpliheg9o@published" data-word-count="35"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dennis-citrin-yrdm9"&gt;Dr. Dennis Citrin&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist who has been practicing for 50 years and currently works at Cook County Hospital in Illinois, has witnessed how bad recurrent breast cancer can get when those treatments aren’t used.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200133b6d74ulaidz@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;Citrin spent much of his career treating breast-cancer patients at a for-profit hospital chain outside of Chicago called Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Eventually, the hospital was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/08/city-of-hope-to-buy-cancer-treatment-centers-of-america/"&gt;bought by another system&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time, Citrin said, it advertised a holistic approach as part of its marketing. “It was really just simply a marketing ploy, because I’m a very conventional, conservative medical oncologist. We used surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and all appropriate treatments,” he said. “But this was the hook that institution used to get people in.” (The chain faced accusations of misleading marketing claims and &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/1996/03/companies-purport-successfully-treat-cancer-agree-settle-ftc-charges-over-their-claims#:~:text=Cancer%20Treatment%20Centers%20of%20America,%2C%20based%20in%20Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma."&gt;reached a settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission over those allegations in 1996.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n100113b6dy1bnga3o@published" data-word-count="97"&gt;As a result, the hospital attracted a certain kind of patient. “Every month, a woman would come in who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and refused any treatment,” Citrin said. “And her condition was horrendous. I mean, you can’t imagine what her breast would look like.” He has seen women whose tumors grew so large they broke through the skin. One woman hid her breast cancer from her husband as long as she could, until neither of them could ignore the smell. “Her breast literally fell off in the shower, it was so diseased,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n0000z3b6dyiib3szh@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;In 2012, he published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3360900/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; for which he interviewed 60 breast-cancer patients who had chosen alternative treatment instead of conventional therapies. The research was an attempt to identify what motivated these patients, inspired by the horrors he’d seen in his clinical practice. Many of these women told him they’d had bad experiences with “uncaring, insensitive, and unnecessarily harsh” oncologists who dismissed their wishes to incorporate alternative medicine into their treatment protocols or became combative when they asked questions. One woman reported feeling even more alienated when her doctor tried to scare her into conventional treatment, telling her, “You’ll never live to see your grandchildren born.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n400143b6d66jisk9f@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;Others said they were afraid of side effects. Very few of them declined surgery, some refused radiation, and many declined chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Almost as many also refused postsurgical treatment, called adjuvant therapy, which uses a variety of treatment modalities (such as chemotherapy and radiation) and is meant to kill off even microscopic cancer cells to lower the risk of recurrence. The side effects can make adjuvant therapy a hard sell, especially after a test comes back after surgery showing no sign of cancer. In one study, an &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2017/breast-cancer-patients-forego-post-surgery-treatment-due-to-mistrust-study-suggests"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; one-third of breast-cancer patient-study participants either quit or never started their prescribed adjuvant therapy. The study also noted that patients who are more distrustful of medical institutions are even more likely to stop treatment or fail to start.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9og001i3b6d7nfxbdvr@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Citrin tries to see this situation from his patients’ perspectives. “She has no clear evidence of disease, she feels well, she’s recovered from her initial treatment,” he said. So then, “&lt;em&gt;Why do I have to do this? The surgeon told me he got it all!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nk001d3b6dc4wf4kpk@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;The estimated benefit of adjuvant therapy depends on the patient and the cancer. Jones’s oncologist told her that with the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, her chance of the cancer returning would be 5 to 10 percent. Without the treatment, she estimated Jones’s chance of recurrence at 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9r5001r3b6d6vb7ijye@published" data-word-count="24"&gt;“And I was like, &lt;em&gt;Well, that’s 80 percent that it’s not going to happen&lt;/em&gt;,” Jones said. “So I think my chances were pretty good.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s certainly not the choice her oncologist wanted her to make. But medicine in the U.S. is based on shared decision-making between patients and physicians. “It’s our job to give our best possible medical advice and the reason behind that medical advice,” said &lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jennifer_litton.html"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Litton,&lt;/a&gt; a breast cancer oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. “But then it’s absolutely that person’s right to decide what’s best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, Swire-Thompson collaborated with Johnson to study online claims about unproven cancer treatments and what could be done to correct them. One thing that seems to work is highlighting low expertise; pointing out, in other words, that this person doesn’t have the credentials to be sharing this information. But Swire-Thompson noted that it’s hard to beat someone’s personal story, in part because it’s difficult to identify what to correct. “When people hear an anecdote that matches some of their preconceived ideas, it’s really easy to believe in that story,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nz001h3b6db9bbvu63@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;She hasn’t studied this theory formally, and when we spoke, it wasn’t clear how she’d continue her research into cancer misinformation. In April, she received an email notifying her that she’d lost her federal funding because her project was attempting to sway public opinion. “Unlike with other misinformation topics, I don’t think there’s much nuance here,” said Swire-Thompson, who has studied misinformation and what makes people update their beliefs since 2009. “I thought there’d be at least bipartisan agreement that cancer is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9p9001o3b6d1bwhqoiz@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6988779/#:~:text=The%20rejection%20of%20medical%20paternalism,expense%20of%20the%20latter%27s%20autonomy"&gt;2020 &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; titled “The New Age of Patient Autonomy,” the authors note that although the trend toward shared decision-making started gaining traction in the 1980s, the internet, and particularly social media, has tipped the balance of the conversation toward the patient. Today, patients will often have arrived in their physicians’ office having thoroughly researched their condition and the most cutting-edge treatments. The authors suggest physicians may need to reconceptualize their role as “consultants or advisors to patients who will increasingly direct their own care.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ne00193b6dsa8xyauh@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Citrin has a habit of dropping an incomprehensible medical term in conversation and then explaining it in the very next breath. It’s an approach that, he thinks, has helped nudge reluctant patients to consent to conventional cancer treatments. “In my experience, if a doctor takes the time to explain this to the patient in simple terms, most patients stick with it,” he said. “But unfortunately, in the current climate, doctors’ time is limited for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9rq001u3b6dnouw916j@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Johnson said he tries to connect with patients who are skeptical. He has told those who are interested in alternative-care treatments: &lt;em&gt;Try it. But keep in touch, and let’s test again in a few months. &lt;/em&gt;“Unfortunately, physicians will often wash their hands of these people and say, &lt;em&gt;Good luck&lt;/em&gt;,” he said. “And that’s kind of the end of it.” He likes to leave the door open, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9s6001v3b6dcjjwumuh@published" data-word-count="172"&gt;It’s not clear that any one conversation or intervention could have led Lewis, the former MTV VJ who developed stage-four cancer after declining surgery, to change her mind. Although she eventually received a type of alternative chemotherapy called insulin potentiation therapy, which Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says is unproven, she stands by her surgery choice. “On some level, it would have been easier to get rid of the tumor,” she said over the phone. But a double mastectomy would have put her in a body she didn’t want to be in. “I would rather live a shorter life as me than a longer one as someone I don’t recognize,” she added. Recently, Lewis has been on conventional treatments for stage-four cancer — an oral hormone therapy called anastrozole and an injection called fulvestrant — and has received targeted radiation on her spine for pain management. She says she’s in pain right now, but she believes that’s because her body is healing. In March, Macpherson &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/elle-macpherson-on-her-celebration-phase/id1585499926?i=1000700888878"&gt;told Hoda Kotb&lt;/a&gt; that she was in clinical remission.&lt;/p&gt;

When we spoke in March, Jones had been dodging calls from her oncologist, who was trying to schedule an imaging appointment. She’s wary of the radiation, as well as the compression. (“I don’t want to radiate and squish the hell out of damaged tissue,” she said.) She’s also very worried that her cancer has spread, and that imaging only her breasts would miss that. “She keeps following up with me … to do a mammogram,” Jones said of her doctor. “And it’s like, well, what about the rest of my body?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9pa001p3b6dds506wb1@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;In February, she paid out of pocket for a whole-body MRI from a private medical testing company called &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/10/i-tried-the-viral-prenuvo-scan-review.html"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;, which came back all clear. She understands that the test doesn’t replace breast imaging. “But I figured it’s better than nothing,” she said. She knows her cancer might come back, and that if it does, her prognosis will be worse. And so she has decided that, in the end, she’d rather not know if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m putting in all the effort and investing in my body, you know? If it comes back, it comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Do not try this at home.) This dose, Gordjinejad says, would pose a risk to people with kidney problems, and in the general population it could cause stomach pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gordjinejad plans to conduct a similar trial where he gives participants a smaller dose.

If creatine levels are low, this affects energy production in the brain, but also the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/301707-creatine-supplementation-in-depression-a-review-of-mechanisms-efficacy-clinical-outcomes-and-future-directions#!/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;levels of neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; – chemical signals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other – he says.

In 2023, Ostojic and colleagues from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, tested the effects of creatine supplements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3597" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;19 patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers gave 4g of creatine to half the participants, and a placebo to the other half. Then they monitored their symptoms, and the levels of creatine in their brain and muscles. After six months, the team found that those who received extra creatine had improved symptoms, including less brain fog and concentration difficulties. The more severe the disease, the lower levels of creatine in their bodies had been at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The hypothesis was that the brain, under the stress of long Covid, depletes levels of creatine, which is a critical energy-supplying substance," Ostojic says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While creatine isn't a cure for long Covid, Ostojic concludes, it could provide some benefits. But there's more work to do; he wants to better understand potential gender differences at play when it comes to creatine and conditions such as long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ostojic adds that women tend to lose more creatine through their urine and have lower levels of muscle mass compared to men. Since this is where most creatine is stored, it makes sense that women would have less creatine overall. "My preliminary feeling is that women with long Covid might respond better to creatine supplementation [than men]," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;lifecycle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cells and tissues in our bodies use creatine as an energy source at every stage of reproduction, says Stacey Ellery, an NHMRC Peter Doherty early career research fellow at Monash University Australia. This incudes sperm motility, uterine and placental development, as well as foetal growth and breastmilk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Creatine may also have an important role in reducing the damage caused by a lack of oxygen, says Ellery, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2393-14-150" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;such as to foetuses during birth&lt;/a&gt; or in the womb. A lack of oxygen can restrict the ability of cells to generate sufficient energy in crucial tissues, such as the placenta and foetal brain, which can stunt their growth or impact their long-term health, she explains.

We accept the idea that couples influence each other’s habits, moods, and routines. But what if those changes extend far beyond conscious behaviors? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if even depression could shift between partners – not just through shared struggles, but through the very bacteria in your body beginning to mirror those of your spouse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Iranian researcher Reza Rastmanesh presents a surprising theory: depression and anxiety might be contagious among couples – not just through shared &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-adult-depression-linked-to-worse-memory-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional experiences&lt;/a&gt;, but through oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of marriage, healthy spouses living with a partner suffering from both depression and insomnia began to show measurable changes in their mood, sleep, and microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transmission between individuals in close contact partially mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety,” noted the authors of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research, while preliminary, opens a new frontier in how we understand emotional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-related-brain-inflammation-linked-to-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; within intimate relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marriage-might-shift-mental-health"&gt;Marriage might shift mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on couples married for under a year, recruited from two private sleep clinics in Tehran. They selected 268 couples in which one spouse exhibited the “depression-anxiety phenotype” – defined by moderate depression, moderate anxiety, and significant sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these individuals lived with a partner who was initially healthy, free from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; and sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured mental health using validated Persian versions of standard questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The researchers collected saliva to assess cortisol – a stress hormone – and mouth swabs to analyze bacterial composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the healthy spouses had changed. Their depression, anxiety, and sleep scores increased, and their oral bacteria began to resemble those of their affected partner. Even more revealing, women appeared to be more vulnerable to these shifts than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-may-pass-on-depression"&gt;Couples may pass on depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth-to-mouth bacterial transfer sounds unusual, but it is a daily part of close contact. Whether through kissing, sharing food, or simply breathing the same air, couples swap millions of microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, this poses no risk. But the Iranian study suggests that these exchanges may influence &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-americans-have-lost-years-of-time-to-poor-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiota of a healthy spouse started to show elevated levels of bacterial groups previously linked to mental illness. These included Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae. The researchers used advanced DNA sequencing and linear discriminant analysis to track these shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggested a microbial convergence. The oral ecosystems of the healthy partners grew more similar to those of their depressed and anxious spouses. Over time, emotional and biological states seemed to synchronize as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cortisol-rises-with-partner-s-depression"&gt;Cortisol rises with partner’s depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured cortisol, a hormone known to spike under stress. Cortisol can indicate how the body reacts to emotional burdens. At the start of the study, healthy partners had low levels. But after living with a troubled spouse, their cortisol levels rose dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female spouses saw particularly steep increases. In one part of the analysis, women’s cortisol nearly doubled. These hormonal changes paralleled shifts in depression and anxiety scores, reinforcing the theory that stress responses are shared on a physiological level in close relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds weight to the idea that psychological synchrony in couples may not just be behavioral – it might also have microbial and hormonal dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-certain-bacteria-might-worsen-sleep"&gt;Certain bacteria might worsen sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral microbiome is more than just an ecosystem of bacteria. It communicates with the brain through what scientists call the oral microbiota-brain axis. Changes in this microbial network may influence neurological pathways, potentially altering mood and cognitive states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia severity in this study correlated with the presence of certain bacterial groups. Higher levels of Fusobacteria and Spirochaetota, for example, tracked closely with disrupted sleep. Healthy spouses began to show increased levels of these microbes after six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One especially interesting find was that a bacterium called Dialister – belonging to the Firmicutes family – was more abundant in women than men. This suggests that women may absorb and reflect microbial changes more intensely than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-might-unknowingly-share-depression-nbsp"&gt;Couples might unknowingly share depression &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that couples synchronize in fascinating ways. They may mirror each other’s heart rates, align their sleep cycles, or even exhibit similar cortisol rhythms. This new research suggests that oral bacteria may form another point of connection, influencing depression among couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discusses “social closeness” as a factor in microbial exchange. This refers not just to physical proximity but emotional bonds that enable deeper contact. The closer the relationship, the more likely it becomes for microbial and emotional states to influence one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why couples often seem to echo each other’s mental states over time. Depression and anxiety could ripple through households, not just via conversations and behaviors, but via silent bacterial messengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-bacteria-in-newlyweds"&gt;Mood and bacteria in newlyweds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with care. The team excluded any participants taking antibiotics, pregnant women, or couples that had separated during the study period. Oral samples were collected from the palatine tonsils and throat. The DNA was extracted and sequenced using industry-standard protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants provided samples at the start and again six months later. Cortisol was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses included logistic regression, correlation testing, and microbial diversity evaluation. All procedures followed ethical guidelines set by the Iran National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these strengths, the researchers acknowledge limitations. They only collected morning saliva, didn’t account for shared dietary changes, and relied on self-reported mental health scores. Still, the trends they uncovered were consistent and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-change-how-we-treat-couples"&gt;Will this change how we treat couples?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One implication is clear: emotional health within a couple may be more interconnected than we realized. Traditionally, doctors treat individuals. But this study raises the possibility that treating both partners may be more effective when mental health symptoms appear in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study references animal research that supports this view. Transferring gut bacteria from depressed mice into healthy ones produced depressive behaviors. Similarly, probiotics have improved sleep and mood in mice exposed to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that microbial environments might trigger emotional shifts, at least under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fecal microbiota-induced insomnia and depression-like behaviors in mice can be alleviated by microbiota-modulating probiotics,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this effect translates to humans, we may need to rethink mental health therapy – not just for individuals, but for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-holistic-medicine"&gt;The future of holistic medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study hints at larger networks. The oral microbiome is linked to both the gut and ocular microbiomes. People suffering from dry eye syndrome, for example, often have depression or anxiety. These conditions may share more than emotional roots – they may share microbial ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such overlaps suggest that personalized medicine could one day include microbiome mapping. Couples might receive probiotic therapies together or undergo screenings that look at bacterial harmony in addition to emotional wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea aligns with the goals of predictive and personalized care. If bacterial shifts can predict emotional changes, then we might have a new tool for early diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-health-and-invisible-influence"&gt;Love, health, and invisible influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage, as it turns out, is not just a merging of hearts. It’s also a merging of ecosystems. When one partner carries the emotional burden of depression or anxiety, the other may feel it not just psychologically, but biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does not suggest people should avoid relationships with depressed partners. Instead, it encourages a more compassionate and scientifically informed view of mental health. If bacterial imbalances contribute to emotional distress, then treating those imbalances could offer hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to confirm whether these effects are causal. But if they are, they could shift how we define and support emotional health – not only in individuals, but in the shared space between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, couples may influence each other in ways we’re only beginning to understand – and some of those influences might be microscopic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPazJLUFlZRktpU2poWldqN1ZYNHUybmk1QTAycGJBaUlxcFJTV01xanp5YTQ3VTU2dHZvenVacmpBeFpmOTBxbUplNGh2MlZ0TEhOSlB2RjFDaUZLNVM5MGxtamxodnl0TVA2eGNLWUQ4WW1weEd5R3BtekVQNF9SMUNBME1CUEU4V3ZfcWthLUhNMlU</guid></item><item><title>准备好进行心理重启了吗？报名参加我们的5天创意挑战赛。-《纽约时报》 | Ready for a Mental Reboot?

A secret code for a mental reboot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There is, and it’s called creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Creativity isn’t a rare gift reserved for artists. Everyone is creative in some way, whether or not they think so, and research has shown that creative pursuits can improve your well-being and sharpen your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;You can get better at it, too. Cultivating creativity is like warming up before you exercise, said Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist and director of the Center for Mindfulness and Human Potential at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As you practice creativity, your brain becomes more limber. You become more open-minded and curious. Your mood lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Next week, we’re going to help you stretch and strengthen your creative muscles. Each day, you’ll spend a few minutes completing a stimulating and fun expert-backed exercise, with an explanation of the creativity principle behind it. By Friday, you should feel refreshed and inspired. We hope you’ll join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-433ac70e"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To receive each day’s challenge, make sure you’re signed up for the Well newsletter. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/well" title=""&gt;You can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; or below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you already receive the Well newsletter, you don’t need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-12cc40b2"&gt;What you’ll get&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;An email will arrive in your inbox each morning from Monday, June 2 to Friday, June 6.

But one study recently put an even finer point on the trend: Young men in particular are the ones giving up binge drinking, defined as having five or more alcoholic beverages in one sitting for men, or four or more for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer Gen Z men than women reported binge drinking in the last month between 2021 and 2023, according to the April 2025 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study in JAMA;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.

But a closer look shows that the closing gender gap is driven as much, if not more so, by falling bingeing rates among men, especially young adult males. So what’s inspiring young men to drink less or not at all? We looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-numbers-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All young adults were drinking less between 2021 and 2023, compared with the 2017-19 period, according to the study. Young women were binge drinking 13% less, but young men saw an even bigger drop — nearly 21%. So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

A decade later, he’s hosting the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thatsoberguy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:That Sober Guy;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Sober Guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast and thinks that “people are waking up to the fact that … it’s so much cooler and respectable and how many more opportunities there are,” when you don’t drink, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-influencers-and-popular-podcasters-making-it-cool-to-drink-less"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are influencers and popular podcasters making it cool to drink less?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramer, 43, and Saho, 31, are recovering alcoholics. Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho. As he says in one &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brandonsaho/video/7365564795493354782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it helped inspire him to stay sober.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While social media certainly has its downsides and dangers, Ramer describes a “cultural shift” around drinking that’s having a positive effect on young men. “You have a lot of media and podcasts and celebrity people who are sober and open about it,” he says, adding that this openness provides a sense of community and a path forward for people, including young men, who are considering drinking less — or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNblBmNGwweS1TTTZXSWpONzNLTndjYjJzX1kzXy1fbG90ald2XzQ5UURxTjNRaXpfVnhJbWtteTVDbzBvVjl0cTJsR3N4dTJGb2F0Z3ZkRG56TjNpM3d4cEdULVpYUEp4VHYycXkzSXZvNFdHYnN4U1VkWUZoeTR2Y3lEd2xITkdCY1o3MTdtazJoSUhsM2pINFNUdWpmUGJiZEJid0VWeXBGempLZXFFZDJpM2NOaW1CVG1GbXpLOHRBMXEzWWh0TQ</guid></item><item><title>年轻男性第一次喝得比年轻女性少。怎么回事？ -雅虎 | Young men are binge drinking less than young women for the 1st time.

So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho. As he says in one &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brandonsaho/video/7365564795493354782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it helped inspire him to stay sober.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While social media certainly has its downsides and dangers, Ramer describes a “cultural shift” around drinking that’s having a positive effect on young men. “You have a lot of media and podcasts and celebrity people who are sober and open about it,” he says, adding that this openness provides a sense of community and a path forward for people, including young men, who are considering drinking less — or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQV0phU1ZPWU9CcHFxdTV3VXpQa2h6SXFPY1RkeFExWWxfVGpTeXlyWXdSb0EyWmN4d0VhRGZVSFljdktfWmR3bTJKUlRCVjJoWFVoUmU0QUtZdV9JU3dIUnhfVjF2ODJvNlZNTXpDX19ZeDl1LWItNGZQcEZTcnlJbFZB</guid></item><item><title>什么对我的疼痛最好：泰诺或Advil ？ -《纽约时报》 | What’s Best for My Pain: Tylenol or Advil? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPNTA4c2xSSmxXbGx0QUo5NHRFejR3VnFBUlVPZUpnenpNQ1Q4bXhZelB4azlRWkhfRVpDRVdocm9pcUwxZmVtdHhDc0prekVTT0lDcFdxUHBRTk1mZkhZY1ZuSTcyMHd4VXRKY3R2ZWpQU0NvNlFGSl9KYUxid1N5Qnk4bXNCYkd5UzlRc3NJVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Q: I never know which type of over-the-counter pain medication to use for different types of pain, like headaches, sprained ankles or sore muscles.

Seeking help for depression. Living with bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In many ways, the shift in America toward cultural openness around these topics is a cause for celebration, said Christina Caron, a reporter who covers mental health for the Well desk of The New York Times. But the proliferation of online discourse around subjects like trauma disorders and cognitive behavioral therapy can come with a downside: misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s hard to know what’s true,” Ms. Caron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In her new monthly column, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/psych-101" title=""&gt;Psych 101&lt;/a&gt;, Ms. Caron tries to combat that uncertainty by unpacking topics like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/well/moral-injury.html" title=""&gt;what happens when your moral compass is compromised&lt;/a&gt; and how a simple technique &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/well/mind/sleep-cognitive-shuffling.html" title=""&gt;known as cognitive shuffling&lt;/a&gt; can help calm a busy brain. She speaks with people who have experienced the symptoms that she is writing about, as well as clinicians and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Caron is a former clinical research coordinator, so she is familiar with weedy medical terminology. But her goal is to provide readers with trusted — and vetted — health information, without the jargon that can sometimes accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In an interview, Ms. Caron shared how she selects topics for the column and which subjects she wants to tackle next.

She was found to have a large ovarian cyst and waited a year to see a gynaecologist after a referral from her GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After monitoring the cyst for six months, it had grown, so she was put onto the "urgent" list for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Mrs Meechan says she finds it hard to be a mother to her five children when she is in so much pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is now 100 weeks later and she has not been called for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said: "I was under the impression it would be relatively soon as I was asked if I had any holidays planned in the immediate future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"About a year ago I was advised by the GP to try to get in touch with the gynaecology secretary myself and I have been doing that on a regular basis letting them know I am still here and still waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She considered private health care but her surgery would cost £8,000 - something the family could not afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was then she contacted the BBC through &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u187894196" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Your Voice, Your BBC News&lt;/a&gt;.

pledged to bring down NHS waiting lists&lt;/a&gt; and make it easier to get GP appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He set out three priorities: to reduce immediate pressures in the NHS; shift the balance from acute services to the community and to use innovation to improve access to care, promising the health service would carry out an extra 150,000 appointments and procedures in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then at the end of March, Health Secretary Neil Gray &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp319z2q46do" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;launched the Operational Improvement Plan, &lt;/a&gt;which he said would make the NHS "more accessible" and cut into backlogs for patients to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would involve an extra £200m in funding for weekend scan appointments and tests and an expansion of hospital care at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The announcement came after the public spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, said NHS initiatives to improve productivity and patient outcomes have yet to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has been contacted for a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Scottish government said it had delivered around 3,300 additional gynaecology appointments and procedures in 2024-25 and that this year's £21bn health and social care budget would include almost £200m to reduce waiting lists with gynaecology earmarked for extra funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Women's Health Minister Jenni Minto said: "Women's health is key priority for the Scottish government, and we were the first country in the UK to publish a Women's Health Plan, which aims to reduce inequalities in health outcomes for women, in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Timely access to gynaecology services will be a priority in the next phase of our plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Excessively long waits are not acceptable, and I sympathise with any patient whose treatment has failed to reach the standards we all expect from our health system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are working intensively with NHS boards to reduce the length of time people are waiting for appointments and treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 05:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE05QjdYMFJhc3lWWTcxamtDUVp2ZGtxYkVCQjI2eU1OUFltV0ZIaGJWWm5rQldyZ2d0TmRsY2Etd1NSd0xZWnA2UHRHcEcxSl96VTZteG5EaFRKUdIBX0FVX3lxTFBQQnB0eUtSOG43czlDNHQ2aENYbS1RYUZFY0oxODdtR2VwY0JHeWx3LTRjUXc5bWxzNFNOYmF2Zlp1bmdUd0VSXzVROWhqVV84SlIzSFZHV2VlWldsUUhB</guid></item><item><title>为了过上长寿和独立的生活，专家说你需要做这两件事- Fit&amp;Well | To live a long and independent life, experts say you need to do these two things - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQUHFZSlFyUGhDS0h6VU5TUFRkLWtld0hjWEhnR0tOOEtockdUVHFJRGRHNi1jYkRKUlJ2dGd6UEVTUmJJX1V6VFJjS0Ixdml4dklZY3h0dXkzRUNySEFCbTRaXzd2OGlRMkpkUy0yZ1VLMmpzeTkzbi1OZUJab3ZJSFJ0d2VsN0dmWHJjcTV5V09HQ29RZ1RjWl9fYXZCWEg2MTlveGVNbEd6dldFZERJeXlTdWppUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seniors who come to my seated exercise class are concerned about two main things: how to get out of their chair unaided and how to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also keen to have the balance to reach for things in cupboards and be strong enough to tend to their gardens. They want to be able to live independently for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I’ve been speaking to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/catherine-norton-2377291" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/profiles/catherine-norton-2377291" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Catherine Norton&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of sport and exercise nutrition at the University of Limerick, and her exercise physiologist colleague Dr Gráinne Hayes, and they have two major pieces of advice that will help anyone achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing mobility exercises regularly—combined with healthy food choices—is one of the best ways to prevent frailty,” Norton tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-mobility-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Mobility training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simple terms: if you want to keep doing the things you love—whether that’s gardening, dancing or playing with grandkids — mobility matters,” says Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mobility training is one of the unsung heroes of healthy ageing. It helps keep our joints moving freely, improves posture, and reduces the risk of falls and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these aspects lead to reduced risk of injury, improved circulation, and minimised wear and tear on your joints, something which is increasingly an important issue as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WKKLUTKBKHReArYqjdU9oM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WKKLUTKBKHReArYqjdU9oM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mobility training does not outweigh strength training or cardio, but should be incorporated to promote and improve one’s performance, be that for activities of daily living or for sports performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says we should all start mobility exercises now—“the earlier, the better—but it’s never too late to start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like brushing your teeth, mobility should be a daily habit from childhood. That said, people in their 40s and beyond often see real improvements in how they move and feel just by making it a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; World Health Organisation recommends&lt;/a&gt; that older adults should do a variety of exercise which helps with functional balance, three or more days a week. That could mean something like Tai Chi or mobility moves like the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-physical-therapist-says-you-should-do-this-exercise-if-you-want-to-pass-the-sit-stand-test-when-you-re-older" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-physical-therapist-says-you-should-do-this-exercise-if-you-want-to-pass-the-sit-stand-test-when-you-re-older"&gt;sit-to-stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to spend hours on it,” says Hayes. “Even five to 10 minutes a day can make a big difference. Make it simple: a morning stretch and a few minutes of movement before bed. The key is consistency, not perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton has some fun advice too; ”Mobility is about freedom. It helps us stay independent, confident and connected to the world around us. And it doesn’t have to be boring!” she says. “Dance in the kitchen or stretch while watching TV. Every little bit adds life to your years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-eat-a-mediterranean-style-diet"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Eat a Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutrition is a key player in how we move and feel,” says Norton. “A Mediterranean-style diet rich in colourful fruit, vegetables, fish and healthy fats can help reduce inflammation and support joint health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been recommended by various health organisations and experts, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/07-05-2018-fostering-healthier-and-more-sustainable-diets-learning-from-the-mediterranean-and-new-nordic-experience" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/07-05-2018-fostering-healthier-and-more-sustainable-diets-learning-from-the-mediterranean-and-new-nordic-experience" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;the World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton breaks down what to include in your diet to mimic it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein helps maintain muscle strength—think fish, lean meats, eggs, dairy, tofu, beans and lentils.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from sources like oily fish, olive oil, avocado and nuts can reduce joint inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium and vitamin D support bone health—dairy products, leafy greens, fortified foods and safe sun exposure are all helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antioxidant-rich foods, such as berries, peppers, green tea and turmeric can help to ease inflammation and stiffness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydration matters too—dehydrated tissues are less elastic and more prone to injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need some more inspiration?

Adipose (fat) tissue releases inflammatory chemicals that clash with the immune system, which can cause inflammation in the skin, and psoriasis' trademark red, scaly rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team of dermatologists from King’s College &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-29f49ec0-3a74-11f0-80a7-1bbe1091aede"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; analyzed data from over 330,000 white people living in the UK, including more than 9,000 with psoriasis, which affects roughly 7.5million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined 25 different body fat measures using traditional methods, such as calipers that pinch skin folds, and advanced imaging techniques, such as highly specialized X-ray scans, assessing how each was associated with psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found the waist-to-hip ratio on a person was the strongest risk factor for psoriasis, but didn't reveal why specifically that type of fat had the strongest association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ravi Ramessur, lead investigator on the study, said: ‘Our research shows that where fat is stored in the body matters when it comes to psoriasis risk. Central fat — especially around the waist — seems to play a key role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This has important implications for how we identify individuals who may be more likely to develop psoriasis or experience more severe disease, and how we approach prevention and treatment strategies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition that produces inflammatory chemicals, leading to a red, painful rash on the skin (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers measured overall ‘central’ fat around the torso, encompassing subcutaneous fat right below the skin’s surface, and dangerous visceral fat that wraps around the organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between central fat and psoriasis remained consistent regardless of genetic predisposition, indicating that abdominal fat is an independent risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catherine Smith, senior author, said: 'As rates of obesity continue to rise globally, understanding how different patterns of body fat influence chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis is important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that central body fat contributes to psoriasis risk irrespective of genetic predisposition and reinforces the importance of measuring waist circumference and pro-active healthy weight strategies in psoriasis care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to releasing inflammatory compounds, fat tissue hijacks the body’s balance of hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hormone leptin normally signals to the brain the body is full and it’s time to stop eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But fat cells overproduce this hormone, breaking that ‘stop eating’ signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The obesity rate among American adults increased from 21.2 percent in 1990 to 43.8 percent in 2022 for women and 16.9 percent to 41.6 percent for men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overabundance of leptin also stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, leading to a psoriasis breakout of painful rashes and subsequent flare-ups in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a related editorial, Dr Joel Gelfand, a dermatology expert at the University of Pennsylvania, highlights the promise of specific gut hormone therapies – mainly GLP-1 and GIP, which help control blood sugar, digestion, and hunger – as potential therapies for psoriatic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones, sold under brands like Ozmepic, Wegovy and Zepbound, are already used to treat diabetes, obesity, and obesity-related sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 NIH-funded report in the journal Psoriasis analyzed four studies involving 23 patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes who took a GLP-1 receptor agonist drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every study showed significant reductions in PASI scores, a measure of psoriasis severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two studies showed fewer markers of inflammation in layers of the skin and reduced harmful immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also reported improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that the link between fat in the abdomen and psoriasis risk was consistent regardless of whether the people had a genetic predisposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, researchers are exploring whether the drugs could also help manage psoriatic disease, possibly by tackling the inflammation and metabolic issues linked to psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Gelfand, the powerful link between obesity and psoriasis, as well as the evidence that GLP-1 drugs could alleviate symptoms, signals it’s time to launch clinical trials testing the drugs specifically for psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The strong relationship between psoriasis and obesity and the emerging promise of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for reducing psoriasis morbidity is a call to action for large scale clinical trials of GLP1RA monotherapy for treatment of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our current paradigm of just focusing on the skin and joint manifestations when treating psoriasis is outdated in the context of our evolving understanding of the tight relationship of psoriasis, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She said she ignored the symptom, attributing it to her recently inserted intrauterine device, or &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/woman-thought-iud-fell-out-x-ray/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:IUD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;IUD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; Jasmin McKee shaved her head and donated her hair before starting chemotherapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one ever wants to think the worst, so that's why I didn't really think anything of the bleeding and just brushed it off,” McKee said. "Irregular bleeding" is not an uncommon side effect of an IUD according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/intrauterine-devices-iud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that most women experience the symptom after insertion of their IUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any other symptoms, McKee said, were chalked up to her ongoing menstrual struggles. “I'd had quite heavy periods and bad back pain and would be really tired but I always put it down to hormones and my period,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she did attend her annual gynecological exam, McKee’s pap test discovered abnormal cells — and later tests confirmed she had stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's like the world stops moving a little bit,” McKee said. “They're using all these big words and talking at you in a way that's really hard to grasp. It's that numb feeling, I don't think I've stopped feeling like that. It's like I'm living in 'the in-between.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She opted to undergo laser treatment instead of &lt;a href="https://people.com/teddi-mellencamp-rings-bell-end-of-radiation-treatment-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis-11709001" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:radiation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/colon-cancer-180-chemo-treatments-mom-facing-her-end-11703601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that she could preserve her fertility and have children in the future, but was later given the bleak news that the treatment had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, McKee began radiation treatment. “The doctor said it was likely I won't be able to have children naturally and that's the worst outcome for me,” said McKee, who &lt;a href="https://people.com/olivia-munn-froze-eggs-have-future-babies-with-john-mulaney-8647264" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:froze her eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;froze her eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of an IUD&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting chemotherapy, McKee cut her hair and donated it, explaining, “I thought, ‘If I'm going to lose my hair I might as well do it on my terms and do something good with it.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she’s “grateful” she finally had her pap test, explaining, “If I hadn't had it done then I probably would've just kept on putting it off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKee explained, “You can sit and overthink it and you might read other women's experiences online but it's so easy to do. It's literally 10 to 15 minutes of your time and it can save your life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-26-given-bleak-prognosis-after-ignored-post-sex-bleeding-11740824" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 03:45:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5DTE16U0ZCY0ljWFdJRkhQRTRzRGlSSFNsdVJGMkJrTXVhMTZZVnJMRzBjTUJ5cC1oYko1Z0JYWWhSaUppX1F6LTdicVNHejRHUEVTN2cwYThMY0Y4alZVVHhDTDhaeWlfVFMzSTVGY3ZFdDA</guid></item><item><title>科学家将瞳孔扩张与大脑最重要的“工作记忆”水平联系起来- Earth.com | Scientists link pupil dilation to the brain’s all-important 'working memory' levels - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRS1aTER6SFlfNWpnQzVSelN0ajJ3aGEyc1hJUGZyMnB3cUdGSVBzcVN4X2o4a3MxSmo5eUE3S3N3cmRpYXJiaDRtWnRodUFCckZDdXlZT3RaR2lGb1kwemh6V0JGcVkzZDA5V0ZScVlNVFpCSHpQYk9ZS3ZaLVI2azJNb2x6WkVoaHVKSG1GdlZKdEVi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things often happen at the same time in a busy kitchen: plates clatter into the dishwasher and a mental note pops up that the soap dispenser is running low. The brain keeps both thoughts alive for a few seconds, steers the hands, and updates the grocery list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this swift juggle “working memory,” yet most people know it simply as keeping track of what matters right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have spent decades mapping this mental scratchpad, but its quirks still surprise. The latest clue comes from the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh study suggests that the way a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupil-size-during-sleep-decides-if-new-or-old-memories-are-replayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupils change&lt;/a&gt; while they concentrate hints at how well that mental scratchpad is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-working-memory-matters"&gt;Why working memory matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working memory does more than hold stray reminders; it stitches together phone digits until they are dialed, keeps track of a spoken sentence until the meaning lands, and buffers half-finished ideas during problem-solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-our-brain-form-long-term-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-term memory&lt;/a&gt;, it works on a tight clock measured in seconds. Because the capacity is finite – typically three to seven items at once – small differences in efficiency can ripple through reading, mathematics, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists often compare working-memory scores among people of similar age, finding wide gaps. Some differences trace back to genetics, sleep quality, and stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others appear linked to how sharply someone focuses in the moment. Pinning down those fleeting attentional shifts has been tough, so a team at the &lt;a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Texas at Arlington&lt;/a&gt; turned to a simple, involuntary signal from the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-signal-focus-level"&gt;Eyes signal focus level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of psychology Matthew Robison and doctoral student Lauren D. Garner, both from UTA’s &lt;a href="https://camlab.uta.edu/lab-members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAM Lab&lt;/a&gt;, recruited 179 undergraduate volunteers for a set of memory challenges designed to last only a few heartbeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eye-tracking camera, like the one an optometrist uses, recorded pupil size while each participant tried to remember colors, shapes, or letters flashed on a screen. The pupils were expected to widen in the dimly lit lab, yet they also fluctuated with mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found was that the lowest performers on the tasks showed less &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupils-reveal-how-active-the-brain-is-even-during-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil dilation&lt;/a&gt;,” Robison explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the highest-performing participants, pupil dilations were larger overall, and they were more discerning about the information they were asked to recall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-memory-and-larger-pupils"&gt;Working memory and larger pupils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/specific-eye-features-influence-how-others-perceive-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pupil dilation&lt;/a&gt; is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, the same circuitry that speeds the heartbeat under stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research showed the pupils twitch in sync with challenges such as mental arithmetic, signaling rising cognitive load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work links that physical reaction directly to the accuracy of working memory: bigger, more precisely timed dilations tracked with sharper recall across the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study appears in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attention, Perception &amp;amp; Psychophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and its key takeaway has immediate practical value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers, coaches, and clinicians could someday use a non-invasive gaze sensor to see whether a student’s attention slips long before test scores reveal a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attention-and-cognitive-load"&gt;Attention and cognitive load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye-memory link lines up with a well-known theory called “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057/978-1-137-00772-8_677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resource allocation&lt;/a&gt;,” which proposes that the brain funnels more energy – oxygen, glucose, and electrical activity – toward information flagged as important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilating pupil mirrors that surge. When the surge is weak or mistimed, fewer details make it onto the mental scratchpad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday distractions, from buzzing phones to background chatter, can sap that resource. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, practice with activities that demand steady focus, such as playing certain musical instruments or fast-paced video games, has been shown to nudge working-memory scores upward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lifestyle influences mesh neatly with the new pupil data, suggesting the eyes could become a quick biofeedback tool for attention training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-classroom-and-clinic-uses"&gt;Classroom and clinic uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individualized instruction often starts with trial and error. A live readout of pupil patterns could speed the process by showing when a student is overwhelmed or under-engaged in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That information might guide a teacher to slow the pace, rephrase directions, or add a break exactly when it counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that people who more intensely and consistently paid attention, as measured by their pupils being dilated more, performed better on the memory tasks,” Robison enthused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, we found high performers also showed more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupil-size-reveals-hidden-cognitive-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; compared to low-performing participants. This is exciting research because it adds another valuable piece of the puzzle to our understanding of why working memory varies between individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-working-memory-in-shape"&gt;Keeping working memory in shape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While future gadgets may monitor focus automatically, old-school habits still help. Brief pauses during dense reading let fresh material settle before more arrives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizing tidbits into tiny clusters – phone numbers into three short chunks, for example – reduces the load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/practicing-mindfulness-can-quiet-the-noise-of-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mindfulness exercises&lt;/a&gt; that train sustained attention have gained traction, and emerging evidence suggests they may slightly enlarge working-memory capacity over weeks of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even aerobic movement matters. Studies tracking middle-aged adults find that brisk walking improves blood flow to brain regions involved in executive control, indirectly supporting the memory buffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The take-home message echoes common sense: whatever boosts overall &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-belly-fat-may-actually-boost-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; tends to support the few precious slots on that internal notepad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pupils-working-memory-and-future-study"&gt;Pupils, working memory, and future study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UT Arlington experiment adds a clear, measurable signpost to the study of working memory. By tying pupil behavior to test performance in 179 young adults, it builds a bridge between subjective focus and objective outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger studies spanning different ages and cultures are already in the planning stages, aiming to see whether the same patterns hold in childhood development, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/taking-vitamin-d-supplements-may-add-years-to-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mind-diet-may-protect-cognitive-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they do, tracking a tiny change in the eyes might soon guide personalized learning plans, aid early diagnoses of attention deficits, or help engineers design user interfaces that adapt to a person’s real-time mental load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the findings serve as a reminder that the eyes are broadcasting more than mood or alertness – they may be giving away the secrets of how we juggle the small but vital tasks that keep life running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-024-02853-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attention Perception &amp;amp; Psychophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 02:34:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRS1aTER6SFlfNWpnQzVSelN0ajJ3aGEyc1hJUGZyMnB3cUdGSVBzcVN4X2o4a3MxSmo5eUE3S3N3cmRpYXJiaDRtWnRodUFCckZDdXlZT3RaR2lGb1kwemh6V0JGcVkzZDA5V0ZScVlNVFpCSHpQYk9ZS3ZaLVI2azJNb2x6WkVoaHVKSG1GdlZKdEVi</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法， 4种方法可以判断您的补充剂是否真的有效- EatingWell | 4 Ways to Tell If Your Supplements Are Actually Working, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1qZmp0MkhWWm1CajJXSXE0WHBQMk96QUpQWTBoRUVxbHpYY29yaklXdzlBVDZzdnhpcjlfZ1BmNllqZmJLYlJXd19ycnZiY3hiMjdQWklVaWM1ak0zaXJvUFRyN3RZTG9YdWhyOWRTUkx5N3BrS2Nuc1FUZkVwekE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When taking a supplement, it's important to determine if it's being effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for physical or mental changes that match your supplement’s goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use lab tests to track nutrient levels and supplement impact over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many people, starting a new supplement often comes with the hope of general wellness and improved health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But figuring out if that pill, powder, liquid or gummy is making an observable impact can be rather tricky. With so many variables influencing your health, from your diet and lifestyle to underlying conditions, it can be hard to pinpoint if your supplement is actually working. The key is to approach supplementation with a clear, well-defined plan and purpose. In other words, “be sure you’re taking a supplement with a desired outcome and know what that outcome is before you start,” says &lt;a href="https://isabelsmithnutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Isabel Smith, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have your desired goal in mind, follow these expert-backed tips to determine if your supplement is living up to its claims.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-look-for-noticeable-signs-of-improvement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Look for Noticeable Signs of Improvement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To find out if your supplement is truly making a difference, start by looking for noticeable changes that match the intended benefits. Keep in mind that these changes will vary depending on the type of supplement. For example, you may notice improved bone health from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-take-vitamin-d-and-calcium-at-the-same-time-8684625" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D and calcium supplements&lt;/a&gt; or relieve occasional constipation by taking a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8425114" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzannerabi/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Suzanne Soliman, Pharm.D., BCMAS&lt;/a&gt;, says that in general, &lt;em&gt;obvious &lt;/em&gt;signs of supplement effectiveness include improvements like increased energy, less digestive discomfort, better sleep quality, improved mood and enhanced physical performance. On the other hand, she explains that subtler changes often encompass gradual progress over time, such as a reduced reliance on certain medications, shifts in blood markers, changes in appetite or stress response and an improved sense of overall well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Soliman cautions to “be mindful of placebo effects and consider a trial period to truly assess the supplement’s impact.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that improved health outcomes may not always come from the supplement itself but rather the psychological belief that the supplement will make you feel better, which is known as the placebo effect. To see if your supplement really works, give it a trial run. During the trial period, objectively pay attention to signs of improvement while keeping your daily routine, diet and exercise regimen consistent. This way, you’ll be able to tell if the supplement is helping you reach your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-consider-how-long-it-takes-to-see-changes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Consider How Long It Takes to See Changes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While watching for signs of improvement, it’s natural to want instant results. But the reality is that some supplement benefits take time. “Numerous factors, such as the particular supplement, the person's nutritional state, the reason for taking the supplement, dosage, regularity of use and general health, can significantly affect how long it takes to get results from a supplement,” says Soliman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soliman says that typically, some people may notice minor improvements in health outcomes in as little as two to four weeks. However, “it usually takes one to three months of regular use to see more obvious results, particularly when it comes to treating deficiencies or health issues.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for chronic concerns and long-term health goals, Soliman notes that some supplements may not show noticeable effects for three to six months or more. She highlights that depending on the severity of deficiency, “it may take longer for supplements to raise nutrient levels in the body, such as vitamin D or certain minerals.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about how long it will take to see results and set realistic expectations about supplement outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-use-lab-tests-to-track-progress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Use Lab Tests to Track Progress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lab tests can be valuable tools to confirm if a supplement is working by directly measuring the levels of specific nutrients or related biomarkers in your body,” says Soliman. Your doctor can order certain blood tests and panels to measure specific markers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Below are some common supplements and the markers Soliman suggests monitoring:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in the blood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B12 and folate&lt;/strong&gt;: Check serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Methylmalonic acid can also indicate B12 deficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/strong&gt;: An Omega-3 Index test measures the percentage of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/strong&gt;: Check serum vitamin C levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin E&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum alpha-tocopherol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium and magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum calcium (total and ionized) and serum magnesium levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride)&lt;/strong&gt;: An electrolyte panel can assess these levels, which might be relevant for certain supplements or health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory markers (for supplements like curcumin or fish oil)&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider C-reactive protein (CRP) or other inflammatory markers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood glucose and lipids (for metabolic support supplements)&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When supplements can’t be tracked and even when they can, you want to also check kidney and liver function tests (AST, ALT, creatinine, GFR and others),” Smith adds. She emphasizes that these tests are important because the liver and kidneys play a vital role in processing and filtering substances out of the body, including supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High-dose and prolonged use of supplements can potentially damage these organs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, regular tests can help to ensure the kidneys and liver are healthy and functioning at their best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-make-informed-decisions-about-supplementation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Make Informed Decisions about Supplementation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most important factors to ensure your supplement works as intended is making &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;informed decisions about supplementation&lt;/a&gt; by selecting products from reputable brands. Both experts agree that you should choose brands that follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure the supplement contains the ingredients listed on the label and is free from harmful contaminants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Look for independently-verified seals like NSF, USP and ConsumerLab to verify that you’re selecting a trustworthy product.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soliman also recommends avoiding “proprietary blends” without specific ingredient amounts, being cautious of vague, unrealistic health claims and checking if the supplement has scientific backing. Most importantly, you should always disclose all supplements to your healthcare provider and reach out if you have any concerns.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Evaluating whether your supplement actually works requires careful observation, patience and proper testing. To accurately determine its effectiveness, it’s best to take a strategic approach by considering any subtle or obvious shifts in your health, understanding realistic timelines, tracking progress with specific lab markers and choosing supplement brands with third-party verification. Before starting a new supplement, you should always consult a healthcare provider to make sure the supplement is suitable for your needs. With professional guidance and thoughtful planning, you will be able to clearly identify if your supplement is truly delivering on its promises.&lt;br&gt;

In 2023, cardiovascular disease (CVDs) accounted for 17.9 million deaths worldwide. Of these deaths, a significant portion (85%) were due to heart attack and stroke. Though many heart attacks are preventable through simple, consistent daily habits, it is often overlooked. Dr. Vassily Eliopoulos, M.D., a board-certified emergency medicine doctor from New York, known as Dr. Vass, shares five evidence-based habits to protect heart health and reduce the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you never, ever want to be the person who gets surprised by a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/health/how-silent-heart-attacks-are-killing-seemingly-fit-indians/articleshow/121410648.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, here are the five healthy habits that you need in your life. Most heart attacks don't happen out of nowhere. They build slowly through habits that you didn't even know were hurting,” he notes in a video shared on Instagram. Here are the five heart-healthy habits that you can follow to reduce the risk of heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. Something as basic as a walk can reduce the chances of a heart attack. A brisk 10-minute walk after meals can significantly lower blood sugar spikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar spikes contribute to inflammation and plaque buildup in arteries, the key risk factors for heart disease. “Even walking for just 10 minutes after a meal can help lower that postprandial blood sugar spike,” Dr. Vass explained. Research also backs the habit of post-meal walking as it improves glucose control and reduces cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet is critical for heart health. Dr. Vass recommends eating wild-caught fish like salmon or taking a high-quality omega-3 supplement. “Wild-caught fish or a high-quality omega-3 supplement can help to lower triglyceride levels, lower intravascular inflammation, and reduce arterial stiffness,” he said. The American Heart Association emphasizes that omega-3s decrease triglycerides and may lower the risk of coronary artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; also confirm that omega-3 supplementation can reduce cardiovascular events, like heart attack or stroke, in people who already have cardiovascular disease (CVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is non-negotiable for heart health, the doctor said. “Sleeping less than six hours a night can increase heart attack risk by up to 200%,” Dr. Vass warned. It is important to get a good night’s sleep every day, as if your life depends on it. Prioritize sleep, and aim for consistency and eight quality hours a night. Insufficient sleep is linked to higher risks of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;RFK Jr. Openly Tells World To Exit 'Bloated' WHO As Global Health Officials Watch Silently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, exposure to plastics can harm heart health. Dr. Vass advises switching to glass containers to avoid chemicals like phthalates, which are found in plastics. These chemicals are linked to inflammation and arterial damage. “Plastics leak chemicals like phthalates, which disrupt hormones, drive inflammation, and over time, can help to push hardening of the arteries,” he said. “Store food in glass, filter your water, and never heat anything in plastic.” Several studies have found that phthalate exposure is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine blood tests can reveal heart attack risk years before symptoms appear, but standard cholesterol checks may not tell the full story. Dr. Vass urges monitoring advanced markers like apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and high-sensitivity CRP on a regular basis. “These can help show your real heart attack risk, years before any symptoms show up,” he said. “You likely don’t need a prescription. You need the right habits, the right data, and consistency.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 02:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>来自人类伤口的微生物能够以医院塑料为食- ScienceAlert | Microbe From Man's Wound Able to Feed on Hospital Plastic - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOci01bVdTVzQ2ZkRQWlROV2RWM3dBQUxraDJfMW5XckllOGlhaWtvSnNIM1M5eWEtWXVyRURYMWJ4VUdUMDctQzRya2lGaWV2bWt0STJ6YlNyeVhTTnp4VnFKZXdIb3Ywb3o0NFBSM2ZpOVNldEtVN3ViUzh4NWQ3aFJENXVkN3ZQQjk4MUhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Plastic pollution is one of the defining environmental challenges of our time – and some of nature's tiniest organisms may offer a surprising way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, microbiologists have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-plastic-eating-bacteria-actually-work-a-chemist-explains-95233"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; bacteria capable of breaking down various types of plastic, hinting at a more sustainable path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These "plastic-eating" microbes could one day help shrink the mountains of waste clogging landfills and oceans. But they are not always a perfect fix. In the wrong environment, they could cause serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastics are widely used in hospitals in things such as sutures (especially the dissolving type), wound dressings and implants. So might the bacteria found in hospitals break down and feed on plastic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, we studied the genomes of known hospital pathogens (harmful bacteria) to see if they had the same plastic-degrading enzymes found in some bacteria in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8"&gt;surprised to find&lt;/a&gt; that some hospital germs, such as &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, might be able to break down plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131937" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background.jpg" alt="artist impression of pseudomonas" class="wp-image-131937 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Artist's impression of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. (Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is associated with about 559,000 deaths globally each year. And many of the infections are picked up in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients on ventilators or with open wounds from surgery or burns are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html"&gt;particular risk&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection. As are those who have catheters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to move forward from our computational search of bacterial databases to test the plastic-eating ability of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on one specific strain of this bacterium that had a gene for making a plastic-eating enzyme. It had been isolated from a patient with a wound infection. We discovered that not only could it break down plastic, it could use the plastic as food to grow. This ability comes from an enzyme we named Pap1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biofilms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is considered a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461"&gt;high-priority pathogen&lt;/a&gt; by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="162718" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. It can form tough layers called biofilms that protect it from the immune system and antibiotics, which makes it very hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group has previously shown that when environmental bacteria form biofilms, they can break down &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-023-00440-1#:%7E:text=In%20an%20innovative%20approach%20to,overall%20rate%20of%20plastic%20degradation."&gt;plastic faster&lt;/a&gt;. So we wondered whether having a plastic-degrading enzyme might help &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; to be a pathogen. Strikingly, it does. This enzyme made the strain more harmful and helped it build bigger biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; was building a bigger biofilm when it was on plastic, we broke the biofilm apart. Then we analysed what the biofilm was made of and found that this pathogen was producing bigger biofilms by including the degraded plastic in this slimy shield – or "matrix", as it is formally known. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; was using the plastic as cement to build a stronger bacterial community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogens like &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; can survive for a long time in hospitals, where plastics are everywhere. Could this persistence in hospitals be due to the pathogens' ability to eat plastics? We think this is a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many medical treatments involve plastics, such as orthopaedic implants, catheters, dental implants and hydrogel pads for treating burns. Our study suggests that a pathogen that can degrade the plastic in these devices could become a serious issue. This can make the treatment fail or make the patient's condition worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, scientists are working on solutions, such as adding antimicrobial substances to medical plastics to stop germs from feeding on them. But now that we know that some germs can break down plastic, we'll need to consider that when choosing materials for future medical use.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256945/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

I'm an EMT and will never forget coming to work and seeing a friend of mine typing up his report after a co-sleeping fatality call. During the call, he and his partner attempted to resuscitate a baby who was suffocated from co-sleeping. The mom had rolled over onto the baby by accident, not realizing she had done so until she woke up and saw the baby had turned blue. She called 911, but there was nothing my coworkers could do. The baby had been without oxygen for too long."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; DaniloAndjus / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Not only will that mom have to live with the guilt for the rest of her life, but my coworkers on that call will never be able to forget trying to revive a dead infant. Co-sleeping might be temporarily easier to get your baby to settle and fall asleep, but it’s NOT worth the risk. Every parent I’ve tried to warn about it says, 'I do it safely. I’d never fall asleep on my baby.'

There's a space in the bone of your jaw/skull that is being eaten away and filled with pus as the infection is left untreated. Especially on an upper tooth, that infection can easily spread into neighboring tooth structures, possibly requiring IV antibiotics, and can even be fatal. There's a fascial space in the head and neck area called 'the danger zone' because of how easily an infection can spread if it violates that space."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Andreswd / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Ignoring dental cleanings is dangerous.

Early on, Mak decided he would not glimpse his own mortality via his machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Were you scared, I ask. Scared of the power of what you’d done? It’s hard to believe it from this associate professor of radiation oncology at&lt;span&gt; Harvard Medical School. But the longer I talk to him and his co-founder Hugo Aerts, fellow Harvard professor and director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine programme at Mass General Brigham, the more I feel uneasy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They proved in a large clinical trial that the older you look — to FaceAge — the sooner you will die. Although its decision on my photo takes a while because it has to be emailed to Harvard and back, in practice the FaceAge AI makes its judgment in a fraction of a second and from a simple selfie. It also makes a mockery of humanity’s primitive ideas of ageing, distracted by grey hair or wrinkles. It sees us age in ways we ourselves cannot, casting a merciless eye on wasting muscles, bones and eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Not only do the pair believe this AI could be used benignly as a “fifth vital sign” (after temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure) to aid medical decisions, but it has almost unfathomable consequences for society. In an instant we could see the potential longevity of anyone from a prospective husband to a presidential candidate, whether they like it or not. Or get a morning mortality report on our own reflection in a smart mirror. That which we might wish to remain secret, our face, window-like, will betray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It was like a &lt;i&gt;Gattaca&lt;/i&gt; thing,” Mak tells me via video call, referencing the science fiction film in which humans were stratified by their propensity for disease. “Do I really want to know? I don’t really want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We live in a world that has become obsessed, whether through social media filters or surgery, with facial youthfulness. In &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt;, Oscar Wilde seemed to be summing up 2025 when he wrote: “It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.” FaceAge is technology perfect for the spirit of our age: health is indeed skin-deep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/night-skincare-products-overnight-serum-moisturiser-q0w9cd2xl" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Night-time skincare: 5 of the best overnight products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“How old you look matters,” Aerts says. “If you look older than your peers, you die earlier. Nobody has shown this direct correlation between the two before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mak and Aerts have long collaborated on training machines to assist the accuracy of doctors, for example in improving tumour-detection in scans. One day they had the idea that they could help doctors not just with scans, but a metric doctors use to make life-changing medical decisions every day, aka “the eyeball test”. Mak explained that the eyeball test is particularly important in his field of oncology. If he sees two patients of the same age with the same cancer, and one bounds in with rosy cheeks from shovelling snow, and the other looks crumpled and sick, Mak will be inclined to assume the former will withstand a more brutal, more powerful, treatment regime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But what if doctors were fooling themselves as to their own abilities? Aerts and Mak ran a study in which eight oncologists and palliative care specialists were shown faces of 100 terminally ill patients, and asked to judge which had lasted six months. On average they got it right around 60 per cent of the time, according to a study the pair published in a paper in The Lancet Digital Health journal this month. “Not much better than a coin toss,” Mak says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The take-home from that is that humans are not great at assessing mortality from a photo? “Absolutely.” When those doctors were also given the patient’s medical history, mirroring the kind of judgment these experts make thousands of times in their careers, their accuracy improved to about 70 per cent. It is worth bearing this error margin in mind if you are in receipt of a vital prognosis. Could a computer do better? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aerts and Mak got to work on training their AI. Much attention has recently been given to facial age estimation apps trained on teenage faces, primarily used to kick them off social media and porn sites. FaceAge would be the opposite: training AI to pinpoint signs our cellular resilience is winding down, aka “biological age”. It gatekeeps the afterlife, rather than Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the study, FaceAge was applied to more than 6,000 cancer patients who were about to start treatment for radiology, using photos routinely taken by technical staff. It had been trained on data sets of nearly 60,000 presumed healthy people — a number that has since risen to 40 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It said the cancer patients on average looked five years older,” Mak says. “That was when we realised this might be something real, not a gimmick.” The more advanced their cancer, the older they looked. The next stage was assessing whether “looking older” according to AI had meaning, and it did. The older AI estimated the cancer patient’s age, the sooner they died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Those were the two big aha moments,” Mak says. “It was a clinically meaningful signal, it was prognostic. There was useful biological information embedded in the face … You are going to do worse the older you look. You’re more likely to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/the-man-who-is-going-to-live-to-180-or-die-trying-bhm83mhw5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The man who is going to live to 180 (or die trying)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;How does FaceAge do better than our age perception? It isn’t bothered by traditional signs of ageing, assuaged by make-up, hair transplants or fillers. It seems to look at areas we ignore, such as the size of the temporalis, a muscle that governs bite strength. “That’s not something we expected,” Aerts says. The loss of this muscle shows up as hollowing at the temple, which may be a subtle marker for overall frailty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The AI also seems interested in an ineffable peachiness of the eyes. Next is the width of the nose bone, which thins with age. Thus the only cosmetic surgery it is flummoxed by is rhinoplasty, which FaceAge thinks makes a person look older. When FaceAge was asked to predict which of the terminally ill patients would die in six months simply from a photo, it got it right more than 80 per cent of the time, beating the specialist doctors who had access to full medical histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Should doctors be wary of the eyeball test in future? “I think yes,” Mak says. “Some doctors might say, ‘I don’t need AI to tell me how old someone looks.’ That may be fair, but why not have a tool to make your judgment a little better?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Is this leading to AI being embedded in your bathroom mirror or smartphone camera, exclaiming, “Oh, mate, you look rough today!” and alerting your GP? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Absolutely,” Mak says. Their research shows repeated photos over time are even more powerful and accurate than one snapshot. “Looking old is bad; rapid ageing is super bad — you’re even more likely to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mak says the scientist in him knows they have years of research to go before FaceAge could be used as a biomarker in clinical settings, “but the futurist in me believes that this is where this goes next”. Aerts adds: “That would be the dream, that this is your early warning system. ‘Hey, something is up! We don’t know what, but go see your doctor.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The ease of a photo is FaceAge’s blessing and curse. The pair grapple with ethical quandaries no one has yet imagined. “Our team are all a little bit afraid of misuse,” Aerts tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The kiss of a camera lens is less invasive than a blood test or MRI, but those tests are confidential. FaceAge is invasive in another way: anyone with your photo could potentially check your biological age. Do you want that to become part of the recruitment process for your next CEO? Or prime minister? Or health insurance? Your consent may be irrelevant if your holiday snaps are all over Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You could walk into your grocery store and they could do an instant health assessment of you from your photo,” Aerts says. “That is feasible, and it’s not even a gimmick. We can predict this individual’s biological age, and it matters as to how early they will die. Do we want this? This is a double-edged sword — we have to make sure the good outweighs the bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I asked Aerts whether he had been tempted to run a whole bank of photos of well-known figures through FaceAge, and he replied that collectively they had decided against. He ran it on himself and it guessed his age pretty accurately, although he warns it is less reliable in the under-50s. Last month Mak finally caved and nervously did it on himself: it said he was 10 years younger than his real age of 46. “I was surprised,” Mak says. He has three young children “and right now I feel more like 60”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I get my results back. Each of my three photos, one without make-up, puts me somewhere in my thirties — one as young as 32, a full two decades younger than my chronological age. Initially I’m pleased, of course, but then I’m not. My family is riddled with genetic illnesses that took my parents too soon and my knees crack like glowsticks. If FaceAge had said I looked ten years younger I would have been encouraged. Yet this huge gap now makes the whole thing feel phoney, more like the sleazy waiter who pretends I’m the sister to my teenage daughter. Oh, FaceAge, I’m not falling for your tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPbmlWb0dYZ1M2UVhsX05ZeTVyeWk1VVRBVjM4RW1Ua1p4UVJFNGNfR1ZHei1salV4VGxTY3BEMnNCTTdkbE90U0p0Y0N3aHE3MTF2eTgzRkNjWjBLMVBZaUxMRy1GcW1qbTlRVm9SM0hoSVRKYk1OWnB3U1BBT05aN3RFTkZNMzVORVNYQ0tOUFJFTjNFWGxIU0V3U01GaFBNeTI2VDhqaFAxYlNUQ3pPYXVMaEhQZw</guid></item><item><title>老年人锻炼：如何保持定期体育锻炼的动力-德撒律新闻 | Exercising for older adults: How to stay motivated for regular physical activity - Deseret News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQU3FTVjhLcWtNOFU2VzZPTktOSUlmVGlzVVZUUDdDVDlfZnZjblJRUng1R1J2eVYxeFV3YlNxUl9jNWZYRHBpTDJQNlpLSXVhNldoWTByV2pTYlptT2Z4WTRzWS1JSlNtZzcwV3ljOHZadTU3d3g4cnNzRkd5eXBWVVNYTWRDNlhSU3AtLTdYNjFDczVBMWoxcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All adults should do at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength training is recommended at least twice a week to help slow down the loss of lean muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity helps maintain independence in daily activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A group of 16 participants were gathered in a circle at the Murray Senior Recreation Center Tuesday morning, each with the necessary equipment, including a chair and dumbbells, as they followed their instructors through various exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As the participants practiced balancing on one foot, Cathy Jeffs laughed at herself as she struggled to balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The members of the class varied in age and ability but they all did their best to get a workout during the class. The oldest in the class, Verna Harshberger, who at 94 years old wasn’t able to do the standing exercises, modified those exercises for herself while sitting in her chair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jeffs said Harshberger inspires her to come to class because “if she can do it, so can I.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The class also had a few exercises that they had given nicknames to, such as “newspapers,” “sobriety test” and “Lisa’s gargoyle” which was named for another member of the class, Lisa Shadrieck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While doing the “sobriety test” exercise, where they have to step directly in front of their other foot, Shadrieck laughed and said that if any in the group ever actually have to do a sobriety test “we’ll all pass. We’ve been practicing it for a long time,” she giggled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/WFZBSYCB3FEY5AJQZUTYW3BFZM.JPG?auth=d4257fb0deba98fdaee84836c64d0c2a477d75d6e9565474161a0fa17ebb9503&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/WFZBSYCB3FEY5AJQZUTYW3BFZM.JPG?auth=d4257fb0deba98fdaee84836c64d0c2a477d75d6e9565474161a0fa17ebb9503&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;University of Utah kinesiology senior student Brayden Kellogg, center, instructs an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults for his capstone class at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This class is the recreation center’s Overall Fitness class, a free class that includes a variety of exercises which help with strengthening, cardiovascular health and flexibility. The class is taught by kinesiology students from the University of Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Exercise and physical activity are important for all ages, but as people age, staying active is important as it can help maintain independence and allows people to continue with common daily activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at how older adults can stay motivated for regular exercise as well as some guidelines on why physical activity is important and what it should look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/XPGEPYS5EZC4ZNJJYCKNZBFXFU.JPG?auth=1a6b5e041c8503c8c5cdda8980c3ec03540006c7d0c0a5eaad71685f98f33732&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/XPGEPYS5EZC4ZNJJYCKNZBFXFU.JPG?auth=1a6b5e041c8503c8c5cdda8980c3ec03540006c7d0c0a5eaad71685f98f33732&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Pam Everitt participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Why-exercising-is-important-as-you-age" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Why exercising is important as you age&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A major reason for people to exercise as they age is “to be able to maintain your independence and to keep doing the things, the activities of daily living, that are essential to be like an independent person.” said Traci Thompson, an assistant professor of health, kinesiology and recreation at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson said that strength training can help people be able to get in and out of chairs, carry their own groceries, climb stairs, pick up their grandkids and perform other daily activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I think the major reason to lift weights is to keep your independence and keep being able to do all the things that people want to do,” Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/62EXY2D4TFGJTBU6KSYIRPUUEY.JPG?auth=0be7aa9e214aa3bed3c2558fd10a4a8dabfd31c3603d9f764cf2f6b74f931004&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/62EXY2D4TFGJTBU6KSYIRPUUEY.JPG?auth=0be7aa9e214aa3bed3c2558fd10a4a8dabfd31c3603d9f764cf2f6b74f931004&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Verna Harshberger participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cardiovascular exercise also helps in continuing daily independence and maintaining endurance. Thompson said that this can be helpful for attending family activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When my kids were young, my parents wanted to come see them play soccer, right? So they would have to park kind of a long way away from the soccer field and walk all the way to the soccer field,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/3HNTBUTQTVCYTIRTLVYJL2WLRA.JPG?auth=29d0accaba89b8b9dc31388aca78389abcfcc34348bd9fe5ffff6bb2866856f0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/3HNTBUTQTVCYTIRTLVYJL2WLRA.JPG?auth=29d0accaba89b8b9dc31388aca78389abcfcc34348bd9fe5ffff6bb2866856f0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;People participate in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="How-to-be-motivated-to-exercise-regularly" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;How to be motivated to exercise regularly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Staying motivated to exercise regularly can be hard sometimes, but there are a few things that people can do to help them have that motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Rebecca Davenport, the academic program manager for the exercise science, sports and fitness department at the University of Utah, said it is important for people to enjoy what they‘re doing when exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JNF6IIJL25EG5BZFCGYZRDBCIU.JPG?auth=31070aff457d260e5a5fa240007afe5054ef4494e7a86d4d26f5b997b037f2e8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JNF6IIJL25EG5BZFCGYZRDBCIU.JPG?auth=31070aff457d260e5a5fa240007afe5054ef4494e7a86d4d26f5b997b037f2e8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ron Liljegren participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Another thing to pull people in is find out what they do enjoy doing. Some people really love hiking. That‘s their jam. So go get them hiking, have them start there. Maybe they really love swimming,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Davenport added that exercising should be safe and it should be fun. If someone finds the activity that they‘re doing boring then they‘re not going to want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson said remembering why they‘re exercising and what it will help them be able to do can also help in motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For a certain individual, it might be important that they are able to go to Disneyland with their family next year and be able to walk around,” Thompson said. “Another one might be being independent for a long period of time and not having to have someone take care of you.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Social support can also help people continue with an exercise habit, and this can come in many forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5WCCIFKZVBFFNCRCFMN367VG3U.JPG?auth=7894d2ae269439a0822b3b024ae546d033a8fabd96861c38dd81fbb9edbf8b6e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5WCCIFKZVBFFNCRCFMN367VG3U.JPG?auth=7894d2ae269439a0822b3b024ae546d033a8fabd96861c38dd81fbb9edbf8b6e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;People participate in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Signing up for exercise classes can provide motivation because of the commitment to the class and having other people in the class who make it enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The overall fitness class is a great example of this, Jeffs shared that she liked attending the class because she makes new friends and learns new exercises, adding that “everyone has been so nice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jeffs first started attending classes at the recreation center after she came for help with her taxes and learned about all the resources the center had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I’m happy I came,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mely Colotla, another regular attendee of the class who has been going for years, said likes going because she has fun and it helps her “feel good.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Another form of social support is finding a friend or family member to exercise with. “Just knowing that that person is going to be waiting for you to come to the gym can help you get out the door,” Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Recommendations-for-cardiovascular-exercise" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Recommendations for cardiovascular exercise &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Regular cardiovascular or aerobic exercise is important for all adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week."&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;

recommends that adults do strength training at least two days a week. These strengthening exercises should also include every major muscle group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;These strength exercises can be done at home as body weight exercises, with dumbbells or bands, and can also be done at the gym. However, it is important to target each muscle group at least twice a week. It is also recommended to have a day of rest in between strength training days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/2Q2OASTXEJHNZKZX2IUNJR4JZY.JPG?auth=a72bc174646bd54c9f7a28968307bcd73e989a728f6d0504266c9ccdf0f16208&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/2Q2OASTXEJHNZKZX2IUNJR4JZY.JPG?auth=a72bc174646bd54c9f7a28968307bcd73e989a728f6d0504266c9ccdf0f16208&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Cheryl Schumer stretches after participating in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When it comes to deciding how long these strengthening sessions should be, Thompson said it is sort of a “pick your poison” type thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When someone is starting out, strength training should take around 30 to 45 minutes, Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Strength training is important to help slow down the loss of lean muscle, which starts for most people around age 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LVVJ72WY5JE3BIX2XIT7VRV5XA.JPG?auth=269df95b43de059c1f2d686f055c7e66b102fc37333f30bb530408815b9090cb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LVVJ72WY5JE3BIX2XIT7VRV5XA.JPG?auth=269df95b43de059c1f2d686f055c7e66b102fc37333f30bb530408815b9090cb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Frank Bradford participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“In some cases, we can stop it completely, but not forever. It will slowly get us, but to slow down that loss, the very best way to do that is to do strengthening exercises,” Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.silversneakers.com/blog/strength-training-for-seniors-2/#:~:text=Building%20muscle%20isn't%20as,off%20age%2Drelated%20muscle%20loss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.silversneakers.com/blog/strength-training-for-seniors-2/#:~:text=Building%20muscle%20isn't%20as,off%20age%2Drelated%20muscle%20loss"&gt;Silver Sneakers,&lt;/a&gt; strength training can also help keep bones strong, boost mobility, prevent falls, fight depression and slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Focusing on the leg muscles can also be important, because many older adults struggle to get off the floor, according to Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UUKTTZFQIRF2NOVAFRW6224SVQ.JPG?auth=88d55033669fd3c8b463e7e937a28c682ed70866efaa9c8b58901f07636baec7&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UUKTTZFQIRF2NOVAFRW6224SVQ.JPG?auth=88d55033669fd3c8b463e7e937a28c682ed70866efaa9c8b58901f07636baec7&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Heidi Brinker, left, and husband, Kent Brinker, right, stretch after participating in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 22:51:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQU3FTVjhLcWtNOFU2VzZPTktOSUlmVGlzVVZUUDdDVDlfZnZjblJRUng1R1J2eVYxeFV3YlNxUl9jNWZYRHBpTDJQNlpLSXVhNldoWTByV2pTYlptT2Z4WTRzWS1JSlNtZzcwV3ljOHZadTU3d3g4cnNzRkd5eXBWVVNYTWRDNlhSU3AtLTdYNjFDczVBMWoxcg</guid></item><item><title>营养学家如何每天摄入100克蛋白质- Vogue | How A Nutritionist Eats 100g Of Protein Every Day - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNdDFrRFVMZlFPaFZFQ3NXUEpXQXA3Mkk2YS1GMmI4aXlnckFrNHRpSW5wNjRBdXliQXRvS1Zza21BUWRWcC13am1DbWMyQWRJUEpEQmdmQWpzelotSUVCVGwyNnJIR1V3eGZBcTNBMU9DbEdoXy1kUkJaOTFkZk1vTE9TZG9BZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use about 120g of cooked chicken breast, which gives around 30g of protein on its own. I add &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chickpeas-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;extra fiber&lt;/a&gt; and texture, as well as a good boost of plant-based protein. Feta brings even more protein, along with calcium and a salty kick. For the dressing, I mix thick, high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/greek-yogurt-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; with lemon juice, honey, mustard, olive oil, garlic, and herbs. It adds even more protein and makes the salad feel creamy and satisfying, without feeling heavy. This kind of salad has balance built in: protein from multiple sources, plenty of fiber, healthy fats, color, and it is properly filling. Some days I swap the chicken for tuna or shrimp. By the end, I have easily hit around 35g of protein without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am yet to meet a protein bar I really like. They are usually overly sweet, have a strange texture, and never leave me feeling properly satisfied. I would rather have something savoury and whole-food focused. One of my favourite go-tos at the moment is a thoughtful trail mix made of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/nut-protein" target="_blank"&gt;nuts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dinner is where I like to bring in big flavors but still keep everything balanced. One of my favorites at the moment is my Thai prawn meatballs with a peanut and yogurt dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prawns are quick to cook, packed with lean protein, and work brilliantly in meatball form with lemongrass, garlic, and a little ginger. I serve them with a fresh cucumber and carrot salad, a handful of peas or shelled edamame, and that creamy peanut and yogurt dressing, which adds extra protein and healthy fats. I often add rice or noodles for some energizing carbohydrates, but the focus is always on building a plate with color, protein, and good texture. These meatballs also make amazing high-protein snacks and are great to batch-cook. Between the prawns, yogurt, and edamame, I am easily hitting around 35g of protein again. More importantly, it is a dinner that feels vibrant, fresh, and light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final moment of the day is a cup of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO"}' href="https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Holy Cacao&lt;/a&gt;, a collagen hot chocolate drink that has become one of my favorite evening rituals. I make it with organic whole milk and often whisk in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/drinking-collagen" target="_blank"&gt;a scoop of collagen&lt;/a&gt; for an extra skin-supporting, protein-rich boost. It is perfect for satisfying a sweet craving without sending my blood sugar crashing before bed, which can affect sleep. It is a gentle way to top up my protein, adding around 8g depending on how I make it, and it has made a real difference to my skin since becoming part of my routine. Topping up the collagen reserves before beauty sleep always feels like a small but powerful act of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 22:26:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNdDFrRFVMZlFPaFZFQ3NXUEpXQXA3Mkk2YS1GMmI4aXlnckFrNHRpSW5wNjRBdXliQXRvS1Zza21BUWRWcC13am1DbWMyQWRJUEpEQmdmQWpzelotSUVCVGwyNnJIR1V3eGZBcTNBMU9DbEdoXy1kUkJaOTFkZk1vTE9TZG9BZw</guid></item><item><title>关于侵入当地宾夕法尼亚州森林的入侵性蜱虫的知识- WHYY | What to know about the invasive tick that’s taking over local Pa. forests - WHYY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE0xaFZlY2NmX1hNZDZxVG8wd2tkdFJaTGtsZ0hjLVMzSENLWjBFaHRlQWx5RVYwcFdqYUZWU0p6NElHNDktTGVFQXFIeXZDb042SDBtRnh2clNHNlVtc2ZuWC1Scm0wbGkxR296amhoMzZZbTVqdGFBdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="flexible-content-container wysiwyg-styles"&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason they’ve managed to spread so quickly, Price said, is that they’re parthenogenetic, which means females are capable of reproducing asexually without the aid of male ticks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the implications of this mean that a single individual female that lays around 2,000 to 2,500 eggs, all without mating, can create an entire population just by that individual,” Price said. “There’s no other tick in North America that reproduces in this manner. And it’s this unique reproductive strategy that enables the Longhorn tick to very successfully and very rapidly invade new geographic regions across the state and the country.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that migratory hosts, including white-tailed deer and black-capped night herons, are capable of carrying the ticks across vast distances, which also accounts for their rapid geographical spread.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential threats to public health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest questions researchers are asking about longhorned ticks is how much of a threat they pose to humans.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Past research out of Asia has found that longhorn ticks can carry a large variety of pathogens that affect human health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s not 100% clear if it actually vectors those pathogens,” Phillips said. “So even if it has the bacteria or the virus inside of it, is it going to give it to you if it bites you? That’s not 100% clear. So that’s part of what we were trying to figure out in our research.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate that question, Phillips, along with Temple University ecologist Jocelyn Behm and undergraduate student Jackson Fahey, collected longhorned ticks from forested areas around the Philadelphia area, and tested them for pathogens. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932861/"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; were good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the ones that we collected carried any pathogens,” Phillips said. “So if you get bit by one around Philadelphia, you hopefully aren’t going to get a disease right away.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings match with other, previous rounds of testing that likewise found that longhorned ticks aren’t yet carrying some of the pathogens most dangerous to humans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. Price said that some of his lab’s current research has discovered multiple pathogens of human health concern in longhorned ticks collected from Pennsylvania parks and public use areas. Among the pathogens they found is the bacteria responsible for causing Lyme disease, though Price added that studies from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that longhorned ticks are less likely to spread Lyme disease because the bacterium tends to be lost during their molting stage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Price said, the tick is so new that the role it plays in terms of disease transition remains largely uncertain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, past studies have found that longhorned ticks are capable of spreading several pathogens that can be found in Pennsylvania, including&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt; Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt;, a rare but serious disease that can cause encephalitis and meningitis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial agent responsible for Lyme disease, the tick has to be attached for 36 hours before that bacteria can be transferred through the bite to an individual,” Price said. “But with Powassan virus, it’s only about 15 minutes, and that’s just because the virus is maintained in the mouth parts and the salivary glands compared to the Lyme disease bacteria that’s maintained in the midgut of the tick.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added that Phillips’ study helped demonstrate that there is significant overlap in habitat between longhorned ticks and local ticks, which provides a potential pathway for pathogens to be transmitted between the species.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of concern is the fact that longhorned ticks are more aggressive in their pursuit of hosts and more likely to swarm than other ticks, as well as findings indicating that they’re more likely to be found in areas where local ticks typically don’t reside, like manicured lawns. They’ve also been found to affect domestic animals, like dogs, and can pose significant threats to livestock like cattle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, longhorned ticks can be protected against using the same methods recommended for local ticks, including keeping your skin covered, and the use of repellents approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, like permethrin.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. According to their analysis, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1533399861"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small amount of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/18/better-than-nordic-walking-this-old-peoples-sport-melts-fat-with-minimal-effort-even-after-60/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking: this “old people’s sport” melts fat with minimal effort (even after 60).&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-4024188054"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an advantage. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the acidic taste of lemon puts some people off, there are simple ways of incorporating it into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional if you experience digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/02/nearly-60-years-ago-this-psychologist-discovered-the-7-38-55-rule-to-improve-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, antimicrobial and even anticancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.

The pharmaceutical industry likes to promote the latest shiny new medicine. That’s where the money is! Older medications that are available generically rarely get much support. Such seems to be the case for a drug called raloxifene (&lt;strong&gt;Evista&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evista was approved by the FDA in December 1997 for &lt;em&gt;preventing&lt;/em&gt; osteoporosis. In October of 1999 it got FDA’s green light for &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; osteoporosis. Then in 2007 the agency gave the Eli Lilly Company the right to market raloxifene to treat women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Lilly Company’s Enthusiasm About Evista (Raloxifene):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘The FDA’s decision marks a major milestone. For the first time, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis will have one treatment option that can help address two leading health concerns — osteoporosis and invasive breast cancer,’ said Gwen Krivi, Ph.D., vice president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ‘Further, postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer will have an alternative therapy for invasive breast cancer risk reduction.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EVISTA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator or SERM (recently classified by the FDA as an estrogen agonist/antagonist), is already approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In July, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) to the FDA voted to recommend approval for the new uses. Today’s decision and the positive recommendation from ODAC were based on data submitted in November 2006 in a new drug application (NDA), evaluating clinical results from approximately 37,000 postmenopausal women that spanned nearly 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will shortly read how Eli Lilly and Company got into deep trouble with the Justice Department about breast cancer claims. But first, some background on this fascinating compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Did Raloxifene (Evista) Disappear Almost Without a Trace?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women worry about breast cancer, especially if a relative is diagnosed with this challenging disease. Others fear weakened bones and fractures. These days many women get a bone mineral density (BMD) test (DXA or DEXA scan). It can reveal osteopenia (low bone density) or osteoporosis (weakened bones at increased risk for fractures). Once a test reveals a bone problem, doctors frequently prescribe women one of the many newer osteoporosis drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might imagine that a medication that does double duty in the fight against both breast cancer AND osteoporosis would have achieved a certain amount of staying power. That has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been the case for raloxifene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last count, raloxifene does not register in the top 300 prescribed drugs in the US. That means it seems to have been mostly forgotten by both physicians and patients. Instead, doctors prescribe a different SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator) called tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer return after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options include aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole (&lt;strong&gt;Arimidex&lt;/strong&gt;), letrozole (&lt;strong&gt;Femara&lt;/strong&gt;) or exemestane (&lt;strong&gt;Aromasin&lt;/strong&gt;). Such medications are often prescribed after breast cancer surgery to prevent a recurrence. By the way, aromatase inhibitors may &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the chance a woman will develop osteoporosis and bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does Raloxifene Work to Prevent Breast Cancer AND Osteoporosis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the double-duty benefits of raloxifene you have to understand what a &lt;strong&gt;SERM&lt;/strong&gt; is. The idea that a drug could act as both an agonist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an antagonist is, in my opinion, a bit challenging for health professionals to grasp. That’s where the term selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One the one hand, raloxifene binds to estrogen receptors in bone. That means it is an “&lt;strong&gt;agonist&lt;/strong&gt;” in bone. By activating estrogen receptors in bone it increases bone mineral density, enhances bone strength and reduces the risk for vertebral fractures (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10730982/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;, Nov. 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raloxifene has the opposite effect on breast tissue, however. There it acts as an estrogen “&lt;strong&gt;antagonist&lt;/strong&gt;.” In other words, raloxifene blocks the effect of estrogen in the breast. Estrogen is a bit like fertilizer, especially for hormone-sensitive breast cancers. By blocking, or antagonizing, estrogen in the breast, the drug reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Uterine Cancer Comparison:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more tidbit about raloxifene vs. tamoxifen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because &lt;strong&gt;tamoxifen&lt;/strong&gt; acts like estrogen in the uterus, it can increase your risk of cancers of the uterus, including endometrial cancer and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/uterine-sarcoma.html"&gt;uterine sarc&lt;/a&gt;o&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/uterine-sarcoma.html"&gt;ma&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also linked to a higher risk of endometrial pre-cancers. The increased risk seems to affect women over 50, but not younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Raloxifene&lt;/strong&gt; does not act like estrogen in the uterus and is not linked to an increased risk of uterine cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Reader Shares Her Story with Raloxifene:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; My doctor prescribed raloxifene when I was in my 50s because my mother had died of breast cancer. She believed this drug would block estrogen from harming the breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must have worked, as I took it for 15 years without side effects and no bone problems. I stopped taking it then, on the grounds that there couldn’t be much estrogen left in my system. Eighteen months later I had a lumpectomy for an early tumor that was estrogen receptor positive. Get those mammograms!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; When raloxifene (Evista) was first introduced more than a quarter century ago, it was for preventing osteoporosis. It works differently from other common osteoporosis drugs, bisphosphonates like alendronate (&lt;strong&gt;Fosamax&lt;/strong&gt;) or ibandronate (&lt;strong&gt;Boniva&lt;/strong&gt;). That’s because it acts through estrogen receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly, raloxifene behaves in distinct ways depending on the tissues. The bones respond as if they are getting more estrogen–so they get stronger–while it blocks estrogen’s effects in the breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 7700 postmenopausal women found that those taking raloxifene were much less likely to develop estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10376571/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, June 16, 1999&lt;/a&gt;). In 2007, the FDA approved it for breast cancer prevention in high-risk women like you. It blocks the activity of estrogen in the breast and is considered effective for reducing the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40275985/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncology Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, April 10, 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects include swollen legs or fingers, hot flashes, leg cramps and, most worrisome, blood clots. That’s why doctors are supposed to weigh benefits against risks before prescribing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/tamoxifen-and-raloxifene-for-breast-cancer-prevention.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; puts the blood clot risk into perspective:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both tamoxifen and raloxifene increase your risk of developing blood clots in a vein in your leg (deep venous thrombosis) or in your lungs (pulmonary embolism). These clots can sometimes cause serious problems, and even death. In the major studies looking at these drugs for breast cancer prevention, the overall risk of these blood clots over 5 years of treatment was less than 1%. This risk could be higher if you had a serious blood clot in the past, so these drugs are generally not recommended to lower breast cancer risk for anyone with a history of blood clots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lilly and the Law:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the FDA approved Evista for reducing the risk of breast cancer, the Eli Lilly and Company got severely spanked by the Department of Justice. Remember, the FDA did not give the company permission to market the drug against breast cancer until 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evista won approval for use against osteoporosis in December 1997, and Lilly put out a press release hyping the cancer-prevention angle–and drew fire from the FDA. Lilly then launched a $40 million ad blitz in 1998. The print and TV ads were supposed to tout only the osteoporosis claim, but the FDA later issued warning letters to Lilly for implying that Evista had won approval for preventing breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the spring of 1998 a swarm of press reports noted that new data showed Evista prevented breast cancer without tamoxifen’s downside, an increased risk of uterine cancer. Lilly helped fuel the coverage by releasing its results at a major cancer conference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“American pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company agreed to plead guilty and to pay $36 million in connection with its illegal promotion of its pharmaceutical drug Evista, the Justice Department announced today. In pleading guilty to a criminal count of violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by misbranding its drug Evista, the Indianapolis-based company agreed to pay a $6 million criminal fine and forfeit to the United States an additional sum of $6 million. In addition to the criminal plea, Lilly has agreed to settle civil Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act liabilities by entering into a consent decree of permanent injunction and paying the United States $24 million in equitable disgorgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evista is approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. As alleged in the information, under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a company must specify in its new drug application to the FDA labeling for all proposed intended uses for the drug. Once approved by the FDA, the drug may not be legally marketed or promoted for so-called ‘off-label’ uses – any use not specified in an application and approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information alleges that the first year’s sales of Evista in the U.S. were disappointing compared to Lilly’s original forecast. According to the information, in October of 1998, the company reduced the forecast of Evista’s first year’s sales in the U.S. from $401 million to $120 million. An internal Lilly business plan noted that ‘Disappointing year versus original forecast.’ The information alleges that in order to expand sales of the drug, Lilly sought to broaden the market for Evista by promoting it for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information alleges that Lilly’s strategic marketing plans and promotion touted Evista as effective in preventing and reducing the risk of diseases for which the drug’s labeling lacked adequate directions for use. According to the information, Lilly’s Evista brand team and sales representatives promoted Evista for the prevention and reduction in risk of breast cancer, and the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Evista was misbranded when its labeling did not bear adequate directions for each of these intended uses. As alleged in the information, Lilly promoted Evista as effective for reducing the risk of breast cancer, even after Lilly’s proposed labeling for this use was specifically rejected by the FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The FDA Did Eventually Approve Evista (Raloxifene) for Breast Cancer Prevention:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are the FDA’s permitted indications for Evista:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Treatment and Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about side effects, interactions and special precautions &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/braloxifene"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final Words About Raloxifene:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are neither advocates nor critics of this medication. We are somewhat surprised that most physicians have seemingly stopped prescribing raloxifene for osteoporosis and breast cancer prevention. Newer medications are far pricier.

In addition, she says, as you age or gain weight, you’re more vulnerable to a hiatal hernia, where the upper part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. Both stimulate acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CUGQEWLCVVHSTOCAY5GDVJ6UZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Many cases of heartburn can be eased with simple lifestyle strategies and short-term use of over-the-counter medications as needed,” says Michael S. Smith, a gastroenterologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6TT5CNMXVEF3O3TWZESQ2CLQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But chronic heartburn — more than twice a week — can require more serious steps. That’s because it may signal a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), says Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In addition to heartburn, GERD can cause chest pain, a dry cough, shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing, and it can damage your esophagus or even raise your risk of esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Lifestyle changes&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6NMN33UHZE7RA6O3D3BT6IM2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/heartburn/lifestyle-changes-that-deliver-heartburn-relief-a8981533378/" target="_blank"&gt;Lifestyle measures&lt;/a&gt; can be quite effective at keeping heartburn at bay in the first place. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774728" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Harvard study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that women who maintained a healthy body weight; didn’t smoke; got 30 minutes of exercise daily; limited coffee, tea and soda to no more than two cups a day; and ate a “prudent diet” — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fatty fish — were almost 40 percent less likely to develop new heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KNP7UAXPMJDW3OSFPKBUGD3BGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s wise to avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn. “I recommend patients elevate the head of their bed, which takes advantage of gravity to keep acid in your stomach,” says Jacob Kurlander, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. (Do this by placing a foam wedge at the head of your bed. Adding more pillows will elevate only your head and neck, which often isn’t effective.) And try sleeping on your left side, which keeps stomach fluid away from your esophagus, Qin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;For occasional heartburn&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F6DDJ3LFWRBQVJPIXTK72GT6UY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn once or twice a week, it’s generally fine to handle it on your own, Staller says. Start by looking at when it seems to occur. For some people, consuming things like caffeine, fatty food, chocolate, alcohol or peppermint may trigger it. “If you notice heartburn after you eat certain foods, try to avoid them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HTPBMOI2A5BSLN4UTNFN3ZTRMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To cool the burning sensation, you can try an over-the-counter antacid, such as calcium carbonate (Tums and generics) or aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide (Maalox and generics). “They work quickly to neutralize the acid in your stomach and esophagus,” Smith says. But the effects usually last only 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZU24XMZZJBR7ORTGXTLT5USU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn primarily after eating and it tends to last longer than an hour, Smith recommends OTC drugs known as alginates. (Two popular ones are Gaviscon and Reflux Gourmet.) He says they’re like a buffer between your esophageal wall and stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AHURMXSBYZHHNLLTBQAR545XKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For even longer-term relief, you might consider the occasional use of an OTC H2 blocker such as cimetidine (Tagamet and generic) or famotidine (Pepcid, Zantac and generic). They reduce the production of stomach acid, and their effect can last several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;When to see a doctor&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T3BRLQU665HFZOIVXVZIBT5EZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re over age 60 and have never had heartburn but suddenly do, see a doctor, even if your discomfort is only occasional. Your doctor may want to rule out inflammation, precancerous changes or esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24MNZUPXTFH27IGFX3VN4ZYKZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do you have heartburn more than twice per week? It’s also wise to check in with your health-care provider, who may suggest a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). These are OTC or prescription-strength drugs such as lansoprazole (Prevacid and generic), esomeprazole (Nexium and generic) or omeprazole magnesium (Prilosec and generic) that block a pump in the stomach that produces stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z5FUNPUEY5AB5JPPPQCIU47UUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OGAMQEEP4VH2FCXABEXQVZGQWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests a connection between long-term use of these drugs and bone fractures, serious infections and chronic kidney disease, although they’re not common side effects. Still, using them for a couple of weeks is usually safe, says Fouad Moawad, a gastroenterologist at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego and a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association. And most of the research done so far on potential harm has been observational, which doesn’t prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Who needs meds long term?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJRNAMLZWJCRNJ336LQZLWX6D4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you try a two-week course of PPIs and your symptoms don’t improve or they go away and then return, your doctor may want to do an endoscopy, Moawad says. In this procedure, a small, flexible tube with a camera on it is passed through your mouth into your esophagus to examine it closely for reflux-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH7UYMKGWBCNZIFL2M2UUHAKD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you have severe reflux,” Staller says, “you may actually see an ulceration of your esophageal lining.” Your doctor may also want to take a tissue sample (a biopsy) to check for a condition called Barrett’s esophagus or even for esophageal cancer. Barrett’s esophagus, marked by damage to cells that line the esophagus, raises your risk for esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SW3QUGJEANAXDCREGCIBDG7OVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If we see damage to your esophagus, you will need long-term therapy to reduce your risk for more damage or even cancer,” Moawad says. In these cases, the benefits of an extended use of a PPI — indefinitely, if you have Barrett’s esophagus — outweigh the risks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD47MLDTENECVG4DZU5KTYE26Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If testing reveals you have no esophageal damage from GERD but you continue to have frequent, severe heartburn, talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of using a PPI long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CY4T42QSFFBPBOGJEEU2AOKXD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your doctor may also suggest that you switch to the newer prescription acid blocker vonoprazan (Voquezna) for a number of weeks or even months. It’s effective at reducing stomach acid and relieving GERD-related heartburn symptoms, but Moawad says it may carry the same potential health risks as PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SDRMU3DZRNEATOOIXZ6F5CFN6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re taking a PPI or Voquezna, your doctor should regularly check to determine whether you still need the drug or can be weaned off it. The American Gastroenterological Association advises that people take the lowest effective dosage for the shortest time possible. These meds are often used for longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;If you’re having trouble swallowing&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3RNAMWW7BFFRIOVNQYGH4A6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Can you have reflux without the heartburn? It’s possible. Some older adults may have atypical or “silent” reflux, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Symptoms can include a chronic sore throat or cough, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or “even the sense you’ve got something stuck in your throat,” says Kurlander. If you have any of these, testing to measure the amount of acid passing from your stomach into your esophagus can help determine whether reflux is the cause. Lifestyle steps like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt; may help. If they don’t, your doctor may suggest a short course of meds to reduce acid production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

I wish I had more time to live, but I don't want more time as a patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barbara Goodfriend died of MAID in November 2024 after being diagnosed with ALS earlier that year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope that something will get done, something will be accomplished, so that others can have the privilege that I'm having,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-aid-dying-new-jersey-maid/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAID is an end-of-life option provided to terminally ill Americans in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was legalized in New Jersey in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the CDC is yet to announce how many people died of MAID in 2024 across the states where it is legal, officials reported 1,216 deaths in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the law took effect in 2019, a total of 287 people have used MAID to die in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The option for MAID is only given to those who have less than six months to live, have decision-making capacity to request the option, give informed consent and are residents of the state where it is legal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An attending and a consulting physician then determine if the patient is medically eligible for MAID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If found eligible, the patient needs to submit three requests to opt for MAID to their attending physician - two oral requests and one written request for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The process involves a combination of drugs, including digoxin, diazepam, morphine, amitriptyline and phenobarbital into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They slow breathing and heartrate down eventually to the point of stopping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the law, patients must self-administer these drugs. They normally do this by mixing the powdered medications in two ounces of juice and drinking them - which is what Goodfriend opted to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The New Jersey local had spent most of her life as a devoted mother and working in fashion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It usually takes between five to 20 minutes for all the medications to stop the heart from beating, however, many people die within the first few minutes, depending on the severity of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she made her decision to opt for MAID in November 2024, she noted that none of her family members, particularly her daughter, Carol Getz Abolafia, tried to stop her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abolafia later told CBS News that even though the decision to let her mother go was the hardest thing she had done, she ultimately respected Goodfriend's wishes to opt for MAID and die in comfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I think the hardest part in all of this, for me as her only child, is to support something so difficult and so contrary to what you want to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The ultimate love that you can give somebody is to respect their wish, to live the way they wanna live, and to die the way they want to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the day of her death came closer, Goodfriend spent a week with her family saying goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's been a week of family, friends. We've done a lot of crying, all of us, but we've laughed. We've enjoyed being together,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robin Plumer, who has attended nearly 200 MAID deaths in New Jersey, assured Goodfriend she would go to sleep after drinking the drugs and it would be a 'peaceful, dignified death.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, here we are today, and what a strange day this is - that somebody gets to pick the day that they're going to die,' Dr Plumer added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Goodfriend noted that none of her family members, particularly her daughter, Carol Getz Abolafia, (left) object to her choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As the day of her death came closer, Goodfriend spent a week with her family saying goodbyes and asked that her doctor be present in the room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her teary-eyed family surrounded her in her bedroom, Goodfriend died on November 15, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a Gallup poll, about two-thirds of Americans support MAID as an end-of-life choice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But groups such as United Spinal Association fight against the legalization of MAID or what they call 'assisted suicide.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Goodfriend said before her death: 'If it's not a good idea for you, don't consider it, but there has to be a way for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not afraid of dying... I was afraid of living.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 19:22:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOMUtIQ1o3VXBiRG5nWkRjS0NtMnRiZllfTW5ocHdOdGhSUWZqNkZud0ZuVmFUOHkwQjFISkJ2b2c2THh6dHJvV3ZWdnU3X2Z4aU5mWG9sdDFsUGdXd0FvWWFEbHVlS1czcHVxTEhvSmpCYnk0N1dvV1paT2VXV3VVSTJIWW5XbVhvNlBIaU9QYlpaN3J3Z3luMUNQLXpUbDFOa1Exa0EzXzVTUTNld2RLZnQzZHJjMGxFbjNtWNIBwgFBVV95cUxQaUttemNGbHFlTmV5ZkpnZDdVYUdtU2hIOW8yaGQzR2VBZk9XRlNmYVdlajhSTWxSVjZudFFzbU9sUmdjc3hzTGU4c1RvcFVVeldLcTJiRWJ3aW5GRGEwRUlzNGdwQ1FUa3hrREd2QnItWFVXc1FveEJ3eWVXOEZHYzdRZGY4aWdjYlZNZS1SQ053cUxaWW1TeTV2aWREUU1kUDRXd3laYmJUbEZFSFQ0ZUhBZnJGYnRROGFIU1VoUW5xZw</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的图表揭示了世界上最具传染性的疾病如何准备席卷美国-每日邮报 | Startling charts reveal how world's most infectious disease is poised to engulf America - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7109605/US-measles-caseload-surpasses-1-000-health-officials-announce.html"&gt;poised for a measles explosion&lt;/a&gt; if vaccine rates continue to fall at their current pace, scientists warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Striking graphs show there could be more than 11.1 million infections over the next 25 years - 444,000 per year - and roughly 30,000 deaths if vaccination coverage drops 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research from Stanford University estimates that just a five percent decline in coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases and at least 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's the equivalent of 228,000 cases and 320 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a devastating scenario, a 50 percent decline in vaccinations could flood the country with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;the life-threatening disease&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to 51 million cases, including 10.3 million hospitalizations and between 151,200 and 164,700 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the US has confirmed 5,567 measles cases over the past 25 years, averaging 223 per year. In 2019 alone, there were nearly 1,300 cases; in 2020, just 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If rates stay where they are, the US could &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7403205/There-reasonable-chance-lose-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;lose its measles elimination status within two decades.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MMR vaccine, 97 percent effective at preventing measles, dramatically lowers the risk of severe illness. Yet 96 percent of annual cases &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;occur in unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt; people, with one in five hospitalized and three in 1,000 dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stanford research projects that if vaccinations dip by just five percent, the case count of measles could jump to 5.7 million with 2,550 deaths over the next 25 years. In the worst-case scenario, if vaccination coverage were to plummet by 50 percent, cases could exceed 51 million with between 150,000 and 164,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US&lt;span&gt; is facing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;Gaines and Lubbock counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, West Texas, where just 74 percent and 92 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas has confirmed 728 measles cases so far, with over 400 in Gaines County alone. Two children in Texas and one in New Mexico have died. New Mexico has reported 71 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statewide, Texas’ MMR vaccination rate sits at 94 percent, just below the 95 percent needed for herd immunity — but in parts of West Texas, rates are far lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Gaines County’s Loop Independent School District, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;only 46 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergarteners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gaines County also leads the state in vaccine opt-outs, with nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren skipping at least one required shot last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7377063/Texas-cities-measles-outbreak-1-000-cases-study-finds.html" class=""&gt;centering on Gaines County&lt;/a&gt; has since spread to dozens of other states, offering researchers a grim preview of what could happen nationwide if vaccination rates drop to West Texas levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team, whose data was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361"&gt;JAMA Network&lt;/a&gt;, used a computer model for their projections — incorporating randomness to reflect real-world uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They drew on US Census, CDC surveillance, and National Immunization Survey data from 2004 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Falling vaccination rates accelerate measles’ return. Just a five percent drop halves the time until endemic spread, while 10 percent+ declines push the US toward outbreaks within years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The model compared outcomes under current vaccination rates - 87 to 95 percent - and scenarios with rates increased or decreased by five, 10, 25, and 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small declines in coverage could spark major outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the US four decades after a vaccine became available — a feat estimated to have saved 94 million lives — but experts fear that progress is slipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told DailyMail.com: 'We are now in danger of losing the elimination designation, and we were well ahead of the world before.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1,020 measles cases have been confirmed in 31 states this year, with 92 percent linked to 14 outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Schaffner added: ‘Given that the current outbreak continues and its now spawned “daughter” outbreaks among other Mennonite communities and there are yet other small outbreaks, we could potentially lose that elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Here we are stepping back to yesteryear.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gradually rising case count coincides with a rise in vaccine exemptions for religious reasons in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles typically causes high fever, cough, and a splotchy rash, but serious complications like encephalitis (brain swelling) occur in about 1 in 1,000 children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, the exemption rate was about 1.7 percent, before a 2015 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7605285/DISNEYLAND-visitors-exposed-measles-officials-warn.html" class=""&gt;measles outbreak at Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; drew national attention to falling vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2016, exemptions rose to two percent, despite moves by states like California to eliminate personal belief exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend continued, reaching 2.5 percent in 2019 — the year the U.S. saw its highest measles case count since 1992, largely in under-vaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic further disrupted vaccination efforts, pushing exemptions to 2.8 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2023, rates climbed to 3.5 percent, with MMR coverage in kindergarteners dipping below the 95 percent threshold needed for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccine skeptics meanwhile have risen to positions of power, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted discredited claims linking the MMR vaccine to autism and founded the leading anti-vaccine group, Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC and JAMA data suggest exemptions could soon top 4 percent, particularly in rural areas with limited healthcare access and public health distrust, as well as affluent, well-educated urban enclaves drawn to 'alternative' medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vaccine exemptions for public school students are on track to top four percent, up from 1.7 percent a decade ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Parents who withhold their children from vaccination are not randomly scattered throughout the population, they generally cluster, which means you have a close affiliation in schools, which makes people susceptible. And should the virus be introduced in their group, it will rapidly spread,’ Dr Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people with measles develop a high fever, cough, and a blotchy red rash. But serious complications aren’t rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1 in 1,000 children develop encephalitis — dangerous brain swelling that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A rare, delayed complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) strikes about 2 in every 100,000 measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years after infection, it causes memory problems, personality changes, seizures, and worsening brain function, progressing to a vegetative state and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 19:04:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，日光照射可增强免疫系统- ScienceAlert | Exposure to Daylight Boosts The Immune System, Study Suggests - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOajl2d2lINUdNRXFBU0szczZoaWdlME1uQkxMVUltclUzZ2htY2JMSHQ3QUF2WFllVWRaOVkyMXg2TWtXYUlHZEhGLXhIcEdsLWdtNXFrWUk5cF9mSU5GMlV0SnVnYWRJVkVKZ2FzUEhweFNoOTJqTVlMcXNFY2FjOE9CaUU2UV9RSzRXRG5wdjBrbEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Ever found yourself out of sync with normal sleep patterns after late nights or working a night shift? It could be you're experiencing what scientists call &lt;a href="https://sleepcycle.com/sleep-talk/social-jetlag#jump-to-section1"&gt;social jet lag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term describes the misalignment between our internal body clock (circadian rhythm) and our social schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social jet lag associated with irregular sleep patterns and inconsistent exposure to daylight is increasingly common, and has been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36164341/"&gt;linked with a weakened immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of our circadian rhythms through shift work, for example, has been &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pneumonia/sleep-debt-night-work-tied-higher-risk-some-common-infections-nurses"&gt;shown to have a negative impact&lt;/a&gt; on our ability to fight infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These observations reinforce the idea that maintaining a robust circadian rhythm through regular exposure to daylight supports a healthy immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does the immune system know when it's daytime? That is precisely what our research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adn3080"&gt;published today in Science Immunology&lt;/a&gt;, has uncovered. Our findings could eventually deliver benefits for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/60mqPF1l9hU?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This time-lapse shows red fluorescent immune cells (neutrophils) moving through larval zebrafish to eat green fluorescent bacteria that have been microinjected.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First responders to infection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms are a fundamental feature of all life on Earth. Believed to have evolved some 2.5 billion years ago, they enable organisms to adapt to challenges associated with the 24-hour solar day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, these circadian rhythms are orchestrated through a genetically encoded multi-component time keeper called a circadian clock. Almost all cells are known to have the components for a circadian clock. But how they function within different cell types to regulate their behaviour is very poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the laboratory, we use zebrafish – small freshwater fish commonly sold in pet stores – as a model organism to understand our immune response to bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use larval zebrafish because their genetic makeup and immune system are similar to ours. Also, they have transparent bodies, making it easy to observe biological processes under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on an immune cell called a "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5826082/"&gt;neutrophil&lt;/a&gt;", a type of white blood cell. We're interested in these cells because they specialise in killing bacteria, are first responders to infection, and are the most abundant immune cell in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are very short-lived cells, neutrophils isolated from human blood are notoriously difficult to work with experimentally. However, with transparent larval zebrafish, we can film them to directly observe how these cells function, within a completely intact animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cells can tell if it's daytime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our initial studies showed the strength of immune response to bacterial infection peaked during the day, when the animals are active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this represents an evolutionary response that provides both humans and zebrafish a survival advantage. Because diurnal animals such as humans and zebrafish are most active during daylight hours, they are more likely to encounter bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work made us curious to know how this enhanced immune response was being synchronised with daylight. By making movies of neutrophils killing bacteria at different times of the day, we discovered they killed bacteria more efficiently during the daytime than at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then genetically edited neutrophils to turn off their circadian clocks by carefully removing specific clock components. This is an approach similar to removing important cogs from an analogue clock so it doesn't tick anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to the discovery that these important immune cells possess an internal light-regulated circadian clock that alerts the cells to daytime (similar to an alarm clock). This boosts their ability to kill bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next challenge is to understand exactly how light is detected by neutrophils, and whether human neutrophils also rely on this internal timing mechanism to regulate their antibacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also curious to see if this killing mechanism is restricted to certain types of bacteria, such as those we're more likely to encounter during the day. Or is it a more general response to all infectious threats (including viral infections)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research unlocks the potential for developing drugs that target the neutrophil circadian clock to regulate the cells' activity. Given neutrophils are the first and most abundant immune cells to be recruited to sites of inflammation, the discovery has very broad implications for many inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The research described here was led by PhD candidates Lucia Du and Pramuk Keerthisinghe, and was a collaboration between the Hall laboratory and the Chronobiology Research Group, led by Guy Warman and James Cheeseman, at the University of Auckland's Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257224/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Doctors gave him a medication with just a 20 percent chance of working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it failed, they delivered a brutal ultimatum: lose his leg, or lose his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Arceneaux has survived three separate brushes with Vibrio — twice from handling raw shellfish with open cuts on his hand and arm, and once from eating raw oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Richard Empson, 78, had been fishing in Bay St Louis, in Mississippi , on vacation there with his family in the summer of 2016. He waded in the warm water for hours, allowing the flesh-eating bacteria ample time to burrow into his pores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one instance, pain and swelling set in within two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he reached the hospital, blisters had formed and emergency surgery was underway to save his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He lived, but his arms now bear deep scars stretching to his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often contracted through small cuts or scrapes, Vibrio vulnificus hijacks the bloodstream and unleashes a cascade of flesh-destroying toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It starves tissues of blood and oxygen, turning skin black and muscle into sludge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not caught in time, a minor wound can spiral into a life-threatening emergency — sometimes in less than 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;About 150 to 200 V. vulnificus infections are reported to the CDC each year and about one in five die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The CDC has not issued an annual report on Vibrio in the U.S. since 2019, when 2,685 infections were recorded—but trends suggest cases are rising. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;A sweeping review of CDC data from 1988 to 2018 revealed that Vibrio wound infections on the East Coast surged eightfold, from about 10 to over 80 cases per year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Rising ocean temperatures are making colder regions like Alaska, the Baltic Sea, and Chile more hospitable to Vibrio, with scientists flagging them as potential hotspots. Paired with high seafood demand, coastal recreation, and climate change, experts warn of a sharp rise in infections—and deaths—in the near future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the Bay St. Louis ER, when Empson mentioned the beach, hospital staff called a surgeon and rushed him to ICU. Doctors fought to stop the infection, but warned his odds were just 20 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Empson got back to his family’s beach house, he began experiencing early signs of vibriosis – swelling and pain in his foot, fever, chills, and blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tried to leave town to return to a hospital near his home in Baton Rouge, but he and his family realized they wouldn’t make it. They went to a hospital near their stay in Waveland Beach, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We got to the emergency room in Bay St. Louis, and when they found out we’d been at the beach, they were calling for a surgeon, and they immediately moved me into intensive care,’ Empson told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/outdoors/two-louisiana-anglers-live-to-tell-their-stories-about-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-coastal-waters/article_fe94e2d5-7ea4-41a4-994d-73e20d918c35.html"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then attempted to stop the infection in its tracks, but Empson was told the chance of it working was about 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I told him to take the leg, that I could learn to walk again,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His niece Angelle Daggett &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/baton-rouge-man-defies-odds-after-catching-flesh-eating-bacteria-on-gulf-coast/article_3fac1452-4bac-11e6-a23f-0fbf97af9add.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘When he went in for surgery, his blood pressure [was so high] he should not have been alive.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Empson spent weeks in rehabilitation therapy to relearn how to walk. He needs two canes to get around, do yard work, and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These days, he does not wade into the water, staying on the bank instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio can enter the body through the smallest break in the skin, even a papercut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It launches a rapid attack, releasing toxins that invade and kill tissues, disabling immune cells that rush to the body’s defense, and invading the bloodstream, raising the odds of an infection leading to sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within about 48 hours of exposure to the bacteria, toxic enzymes ravage tissue under the skin, liquifying muscle and fat, and leaving the skin blackened and rotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laura Barajas, mother to a six-year-old boy, became sick with vibriosis in late July 2023 days after eating the fish that she had purchased at a local market in San Jose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Arcenaux has been infected with the bacteria on two different occasions through cuts on his arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first time he was infected, he got a small cut on his arm while about five dozen crabs, having reached into a water-filled bucket to lift one out one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That was on a Thursday, and within 24 hours I was on the way to the hospital and had surgery within two hours,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Arcenaux was able to avoid amputation. Doctors typically administer high doses of antibiotics intravenously and can sometimes halt the infection’s spread by removing dead tissue on the arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was 36 hours at the Baton Rouge General for the next one, he said. ‘To survive, I’m lucky twice, very lucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio requires warm water to grow and proliferate, making Gulf Coast beaches prime breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH) data indicates there are about 10 to 15 cases per year in the state and has not recorded any steady increases in recent years, though cases fluctate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most get the infection from skin contact with seawater (80 percent) or consumption of raw seafood (20 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barajas had to undergo a quadruple amputation. Her friend Anna Messina shared that Barajas’ 'fingers were black, her feet were black her bottom lip was black' and her kidneys were failing as the vibrio bacteria ravaged her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura Barajas, a 40-year-old mother from San Jose, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12527459/California-woman-loses-limbs-undercooked-TILAPIA-fish.html"&gt;underwent quadruple amputation&lt;/a&gt; after contracting a severe Vibrio vulnificus infection from undercooked tilapia she prepared at home in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria — which the CDC warns can cause life-threatening sepsis — left her in a medically induced coma with failing kidneys and necrotic limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barajas, who has a six-year-old son, survived but faces a lifelong disability.

            &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;JERUSALEM (JNS) – Stand up paddle boarding has been variously described in Jewish and Israeli sources as “a good metaphor for life” and as an activity for which the Jewish state, and particularly its Dead Sea, is a “paradise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But according to seven Israeli doctors and researchers from the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, who published their findings this month in the &lt;em&gt;Israel Medical Association Journal&lt;/em&gt;, stand up paddling can lead to life-threatening health problems even in people who are in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The possible health advantages boasted by SUP include core muscle training and cardiovascular benefits,” the scholars, led by Dr. Maguli Barel, write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“SUP has been promoted as a sport that both promotes fitness and strength and is enjoyable,” but it “may be associated with sudden changes in blood pressure and increase in shear stress that may play an important role in atherothrombosis,” they add, of blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scholars’ data suggests that stand up paddling “may also trigger life-threatening coronary events, even in fit individuals,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-module bg-silver moved"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-inner"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-items"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-item"&gt;
&lt;p class="related-articles-item-text"&gt;The researchers note that the sport, which is “a mix between canoeing and surfing,” involves someone standing “upright on a surfboard” and propelling themselves via a single paddle. “It is an emerging recreational activity that is attracting public attention and gaining popularity because it promotes fitness, strength and improved balance,” they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scholars studied five men and one woman—whose ages ranged from 41 to 69 and who were all fit—who experienced sudden cardiac arrest or a heart attack while paddling. “All patients were discharged alive,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A review of the literature showed a paucity of scientific evidence to substantiate the proposed health benefits of SUP surfing,” they wrote. “Our cluster of acute cardiac events occurring during this activity calls for heightened public awareness to better understand the physical demand required to practice SUP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a need for more data regarding the cardiovascular clinical aspects of this water activity and the risks it entails,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They note that their medical center is located near “an active and popular sea sport center with many different attractions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the six subjects, a 41-year-old man, was “otherwise healthy” but found collapsed, lying on his surfboard a few yards from shore “with his head in the water,” they write. Bystanders, who performed CPR immediately, managed after half an hour to help his blood circulation resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-540109" src="https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/05/F240523MG022-1320x880.jpg" alt="Stand up paddle board"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A man stand up paddle boards in the Kinneret, in the northern Israeli town of Tiberias, May 23, 2024. Credit: Michael Giladi/Flash90.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“He was evacuated to our center in critical condition and was sedated and intubated,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another otherwise healthy man, 47, collapsed on a beach a few minutes after stand up paddling, and a third man, 69, complained of chest pain while paddling with his son and collapsed when they returned to shore. “He was pulled from the water by his son,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The other three patients were a 46-year-old woman who developed chest pain while paddling a few hundred yards and made it back to shore, a 67-year-old man who raced a friend some 1,000 yards to shore with “intense paddling and surfing” before experienced chest pain and shortness of breath and a 57-year-old man who had a heart attack after feeling chest pain and shortness of breath while paddling a few hundred yards from the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Most incidents occur during summer months, which are characterized by elevated temperatures and usually high humidity. These conditions are known to significantly impact heart rate, and exercise intensity potentially exacerbates cardiovascular strain,” the researchers wrote. “Two of our patients had a previous heart condition but were asymptomatic and were able to perform vigorous exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sudden cardiac arrest in recreational athletes, while rare, can be a significant concern,” they added. “This condition refers to an unexpected death due to cardiac causes within a short time frame, often during or immediately after physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

My perfectly healthy four year old not being able to walk scared me. I had no idea [what was wrong with her].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We went camping on Mother's day weekend so [the tick] had been there for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As soon as she woke up she couldn't walk and she was crawling on the floor. Think of somebody that's been intoxicated by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-ed98c730-371c-11f0-9a61-af4c39c1af23"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. That's why we took her to the hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After rushing her to the emergency department, doctors found a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13830053/Man-61-deadly-tick-borne-infection-brain-doctors-report-case.html"&gt;dime-sized tick latched onto Madeline's head&lt;/a&gt;, which was causing tick paralysis, a rare and life-threatening condition caused by a neurotoxin released by certain ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice added: 'The paralysis affected her whole body and she was unable to make eye contact with anybody. It caused complete paralysis from the bottom and it was working its way up to her hands and her head and she was not even able to sit up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline and her family spent the weekend camping to celebrate Mother's Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Justice had to pull her daughter around the hospital in a wagon because Madeline couldn't walk by herself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tick paralysis is rare and there is no formal monitoring of the condition, so it is unknown how many cases occur per year. It's been documented worldwide and is more commonly seen in children and adult men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been documented in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paralysis is caused by a neurotoxin from tick saliva, and the condition has been associated with 40 different species. In North America, most cases are associated with the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the condition is caught early and the tick is removed, paralysis will reverse and a complete recovery is expected, typically within 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not diagnosed and left to advance, it can lead to respiratory failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include weakness, paralysis beginning in the legs and rising, loss of coordination, difficulty breathing and paralysis of the respiratory muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They usually occur two to seven days after a tick bite.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed to the hospital, doctors ran tests and did a CT scan on Madeline that revealed no significant findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then referred her to a more advanced children's hospital three hours away where a neurologist performed tests on her to check the toddler's reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors discovered a female Rocky Mountain wood tick, which has toxic saliva that caused paralysis in Madeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline's mom said the family is always outside and will be vigilant about checking for ticks from now on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice said: 'The next morning [the neurosurgeon] came in and he noticed she couldn't use her hands. We tried to play [a game] and she couldn't pick up the checkers to put them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said "something's not right" and all of a sudden, he just asked "are you guys outside a lot?" We live outside and our family goes camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As soon as he asked, he checked her head. Two seconds later he said he'd found the diagnosis and it was the tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologist discovered a female Rocky Mountain wood tick on her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice continued: 'I felt sick and I wanted it removed immediately. It was in her blood. Only females produce that neurotoxin in their saliva and whenever they bite their saliva produces a numbing agent so Madeline wouldn't feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were concerned it could cause Lyme disease because it can cause long term effects on children and adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease is another tick-borne illness, but it is not caused by a neurotoxin as with tick paralysis. Lyme is a bacterial infection that causes flu-like symptoms and it is not reversible by simply removing the tick - doctors must prescribe antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline's mom, Justice (left), said she was terrified when her daughter woke up not being able to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline was able to walk again four hours after the tick was removed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once her doctors realized the cause of her paralysis, they removed the tick from her head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madeline was able to walk again four hours after the tick was removed and she was given a dose of doxycycline - an antibiotic - to reduce the risk of Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the ordeal, Justice said she will now 'be so vigilant' about carrying tick repellant and checking Madeline for ticks and urges other parents to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I never thought a tick bite would lead to all this. I've never seen anything like it before. She still wakes up in the morning and her legs are a little stiff but once she starts walking throughout the day it's like normal again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Check your kids [for tick bites] and be adamant about checking their heads, behind their ears and even their waistline. There's a possibility that could happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So when my editor asked if I would cut them out completely for a week and write about how it impacted me, I thought it would be pretty anticlimactic. Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The week-long experiment served as a sobering look at how I actually ate compared to how I &lt;em&gt;thought &lt;/em&gt;I ate. Ever since the experiment ended, my grocery shopping has completely changed. Here, I share how the experiment went and what I learned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Trying to Cut Out Ultra-Processed Foods Changed My Meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before beginning the experiment, I had to determine the line between processed foods and ultra-processed foods. Technically, any food that has been changed from its natural state is processed—even if that only change was washing, chopping or packaging. Even a frozen bag of mixed vegetables is processed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultra-processed is a little different. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-are-they-bad-for-our-health-2020010918605" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; are industrially manufactured products that often contain additives and other ingredients that aren’t typically found in a home kitchen. With this in mind, I decided that any food with an ingredients list containing anything I didn’t recognize or could easily source was ultra-processed. If I couldn’t make the food at home based on the ingredients list, it was a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to begin my experiment of nixing ultra-processed foods starting with the foods I already had at home. I wanted the first part of the week to serve as a reality check for how many ultra-processed foods were currently part of my diet and the second part to be after I went grocery shopping, to see how cutting ultra-processed foods out impacted what I bought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I typically start the day with the same breakfast: a bowl of fruit, Justin’s Almond Butter and trail mix. The almond butter only had two ingredients, so I was all good there, but looking at the ingredients for the trail mix, I realized it was more processed than I thought. Besides nuts and dried cranberries, it contains mini peanut butter cups, which made for a long ingredients list full of additives. Instead of having it, I switched it out for Purely Elizabeth granola, which didn’t have any additives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the day, I wanted a snack. I was craving some naan crisps and hummus. Unfortunately, the naan crisps had an ingredients list I just couldn’t replicate in the kitchen, making them a no-go. Instead, I had my hummus with some Simple Mill crackers, which were made only with ingredients I could recognize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For lunch, I planned to have a salad with leftover salmon and Parmesan cheese. The hurdle here came down to the dressing. All the salad dressings I had were full of additives. This experiment was already turning out to be harder than I thought. Instead of dressing, I topped my salad off with olive oil and some rosemary and basil from my garden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinner was chicken, green beans and rice. It was the first meal of the day I didn’t have to alter. I always crave something sweet for dessert and my recent go-to has been Tru Fu chocolate-covered fruit. I thought this would still get a pass, but due to the chocolate, the ingredients list was super long. I’ll admit it. I cheated here and still had a handful of the fruit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/sneaky-ways-youre-adding-calories-to-your-diet-according-to-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I had the same breakfast as before with the Purely Elizabeth granola taking the place of trail mix. But once again, lunch was a hurdle. Not wanting a salad, I was planning on heating up a Fillo tamale. These tamales are labeled as vegan and preservative-free, so I assumed they weren’t ultra-processed. Unfortunately, the ingredients list proves otherwise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of the tamale, I made a salad using tofu as my protein. I topped it off with olive oil and herbs like I did yesterday. At least my garden herbs were getting good use! I had to admit, it had just as much flavor as when I used a bottled salad dressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinner was homemade kimchi fried rice, mixed vegetables and tofu. Nothing ultra-processed here! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/food-people-over-50-should-eat-more-of-according-to-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Food Nutritionists Are Begging People Over 50 Start Eating ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Food Nutritionists Are Begging People Over 50 Start Eating ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch was easier for me today because I had leftover kimchi fried rice. It was snack time that was today’s hurdle. I was craving something sweet, and I knew my tried-and-true chocolate-covered fruit was out. Instead, I had Simple Mills honey cinnamon crackers, which had a simple ingredients list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That afternoon, I got &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/khloe-kardashian-surprising-new-snack-release-khloud-protein-popcorn-target" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Khloe Kardashian’s new protein popcorn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Khloe Kardashian’s new protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt; in the mail sent to me by her publicist. I like the idea of a protein popcorn, but since it was made with whey protein powder (not an ingredient found in the common kitchen), I couldn’t try it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dinner I had planned for tonight was vegan chicken tacos, made with Daring plant-based cajun chicken. This dinner ended up being full of ultra-processed landmines. Not only was the plant-based chicken ultra-processed, so were the organic corn and wheat tortillas and Siete tortilla chips. The only non-ultra-processed ingredients were the pico de gallo and guacamole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a big lesson to me that just because something was plant-based or organic didn’t mean it wasn’t ultra-processed, or even healthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-foods-for-memory-brain-health-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Foods to Eat Daily for Better Memory, According to RDs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Foods to Eat Daily for Better Memory, According to RDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I opened the pantry and realized I was completely out of almond butter for my breakfast. I did find a jar of peanut butter, but the ingredients list was full of additives. Since nut butter was the only protein-containing ingredient in my breakfast, this meant my meal had no protein whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not surprisingly, I was starving by the time lunch rolled around and decided to walk to the local deli. Eyeing the menu, I tried to figure out which item was the least processed. I opted for a Greek hummus wrap. This still left questions: What was in the wrap? What about the hummus? This showed me that eating out while avoiding ultra-processed foods is super tricky since you don’t have access to the ingredient lists. My wrap also came with a side of potato chips. Not being able to resist, I ate them. I blame the lack of protein at breakfast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For dinner, my partner and I wanted to order some takeout. We decided sushi was the least processed option. I enjoyed my tuna rolls without worrying about what was in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, I always treat myself to a slice of banana bread from a local French bakery. Everything is made fresh on-site, so I figured my banana bread didn’t count as ultra-processed; I could make it at home if I wanted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For lunch, I bought a tossed salad. The only ultra-processed ingredient was the Caesar dressing I asked for; a similar hurdle to when I make my salads at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For dinner, my partner and I made pasta with chicken sausage we bought from the local butcher’s market. Chicken sausage is certainly processed and not the healthiest, but at least we bought it from a local source. But I had to admit to myself that it likely didn’t make it much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, my partner and I planned our meals for the following week based on avoiding ultra-processed foods. Our dinners tend not to have ultra-processed foods anyway, but it was much easier to eat non-ultra-processed foods when the grocery shopping was based around it—including snack choices. That night, we had roasted chicken and green beans for dinner. It was simple and filling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though my fridge and pantry were stocked with plenty of non-ultra-processed foods, I still found myself reaching for some Siete chips at lunchtime and some chocolate-covered strawberries for dessert. Otherwise, I avoided anything ultra-processed the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What a Week of Trying to Cut Ultra-Processed Foods Taught Me&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I learned from my week-long experiment of trying to avoid ultra-processed foods is just how much they are ingrained in our modern food system. Even some of my go-to “healthy” staples, like trail mix, plant-based chicken, salad dressings and chocolate-covered fruit were more processed than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it was easier to make substitutions than I realized. It turns out that a salad topped with olive oil and herbs is just as flavorful as one topped with a bottled dressing. And some brands are making a conscious effort to only use simple ingredients, like Simple Mills or my trusty almond butter favorite, Justin’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also learned that avoiding ultra-processed foods is infinitely easier when you base your grocery shopping around it and plan your meals accordingly, including figuring out what you’re going to eat when a craving for something sweet or salty hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I am absolutely going to be even more mindful of reading ingredient lists when I grocery shop. But I will admit that there are some foods I’m just not going to replace, like my beloved chocolate-covered fruit. Everything in moderation, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/day-of-heart-healthy-eating-according-to-a-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: ‘I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: ‘I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-cutting-out-ultra-processed-food-for-a-week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Tried Cutting Out Ultra-Processed Food for a Week and I Was Shocked by What I Learned’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘I Tried Cutting Out Ultra-Processed Food for a Week and I Was Shocked by What I Learned’&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on May 26, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFA2cm1vTTdrYTFlb0c2elNDWTZ5Z3JFcjBaYXhHSTZDQlVJOHpFU2RIejZjX3U1RWh0Wl9Iakl5Q1lSay1zY25XYmdtc2RyZnZzTWN5enNSVHM3RlRYRF8yMUJ5N05VMG9nLVFhMkY0cmtEZTlvY2NJVw</guid></item><item><title>大麻二酚显示出通过针对大脑多动症治疗小鼠阿尔茨海默病的前景- PsyPost | Cannabidiol shows promise for treating Alzheimer’s in mice by targeting brain hyperactivity - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOaHV4cXpYWXlJS003SUF2RnJ3eTVtaFNkNEZ0UFk1NjJVOE5fNjV6SV93LUEwd0lXb0M2LUZhNTEwY2lyTDVlckxxdHdmWExhcWR1Mm8xNUZqNXE1eUhPTGdvd28ybWkzVkRsNWZ3MjhYYXh4a2dEaS1zbGd4cGhMZE8tc0dTWlozanh2U3hkYnJBSlpWNGV5UWdsbnNHOWJva2laMXUzei1vTGUzRC0wYU1rbEJhUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02789-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides preliminary evidence that cannabidiol, a compound derived from cannabis, may reduce cognitive decline and brain pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that chronic administration of cannabidiol improved memory performance and reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques—one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. These benefits were linked to cannabidiol’s ability to regulate overactive brain cells in a key region involved in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of the main components of cannabis. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it does not produce a high and is generally considered safe. In recent years, researchers have been exploring its potential therapeutic effects on various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. One area of interest is whether CBD can calm excessive brain activity, a problem observed in people and animals with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, based in China, conducted a series of experiments to test whether CBD could reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s in genetically modified mice known as 5×FAD mice. These animals are widely used in research because they develop Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, including memory loss and the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. The researchers administered a low daily dose of CBD to these mice for just over a month and then assessed their behavior, brain activity, and the extent of brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate memory function, the mice completed a series of behavioral tests. In a novel object recognition test, CBD-treated mice spent more time exploring new objects, indicating improved recognition memory. In two separate spatial memory tasks—the Morris water maze and the Barnes maze—CBD-treated mice learned the location of a hidden platform more quickly and remembered it better than untreated mice. These improvements in memory occurred without changes in general motor function or anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that CBD had specific effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond behavior, the researchers looked directly at the brains of the mice. They found that CBD treatment led to a reduction in amyloid-beta plaques, particularly in the dentate gyrus, a part of the hippocampus that plays an important role in learning and memory. The reduction was most noticeable in smaller plaques, which are typically newly formed. This suggests that CBD may help slow the formation of new plaques rather than clear out existing ones. Importantly, the extent of plaque reduction in the dentate gyrus was strongly associated with the improvements in memory, highlighting the relevance of this brain region in both pathology and treatment response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also investigated how CBD might achieve these effects at the molecular level. The researchers focused on glycine receptors, which help regulate electrical activity in the brain by dampening excessive neuronal firing. These receptors are particularly abundant in the dentate gyrus. Previous studies have shown that CBD can enhance the activity of glycine receptors by binding to a specific site on the receptor protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using genetic techniques, the researchers disrupted glycine receptor function in some mice to test whether these receptors were necessary for CBD’s effects. In mice where glycine receptors in the dentate gyrus were either knocked down or altered to prevent CBD binding, the beneficial effects of CBD disappeared. These mice showed no improvements in memory and no reduction in amyloid-beta plaques, strongly suggesting that glycine receptors are a key mechanism behind CBD’s therapeutic action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore how this might affect brain function, the researchers used several techniques to measure neuronal activity. In untreated Alzheimer’s model mice, neurons in the dentate gyrus were overly active, firing more rapidly than normal. Chronic CBD treatment reduced this hyperactivity, bringing the cells’ behavior closer to normal levels. This calming effect was not observed in mice with disabled glycine receptors, further reinforcing their central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also recorded brain activity in living mice by implanting electrodes and using calcium imaging, a technique that tracks real-time cellular activity. They found that after CBD infusion, many neurons in the dentate gyrus showed a marked drop in activity. In contrast, mice with a mutated version of the glycine receptor that could not interact with CBD showed little to no change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, there are several limitations to the study. First, the research was conducted in mice, not humans. Although animal models are useful for understanding disease mechanisms and testing treatments, they do not capture all aspects of human Alzheimer’s. Second, the study only used male mice, and future research will need to explore whether the same results hold true in females. Third, while the study identified glycine receptors as an important target for CBD, the compound interacts with many other receptors and systems in the brain. More work is needed to understand how these other pathways may contribute to its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that CBD has potential as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. By reducing abnormal brain activity and slowing the formation of harmful plaques, CBD may help preserve memory and cognitive function. The study also highlights the importance of glycine receptors in regulating brain activity and offers a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02789-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cannabidiol ameliorates cognitive decline in 5×FAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease through potentiating the function of extrasynaptic glycine receptors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jin Jin, Chonglei Fu, Jing Xia, Heyi Luo, Xianglian Wang, Si Chen, Huanhuan Mao, Kai Yuan, Lin Lu, Wei Xiong, and Guichang Zou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 18:01:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOaHV4cXpYWXlJS003SUF2RnJ3eTVtaFNkNEZ0UFk1NjJVOE5fNjV6SV93LUEwd0lXb0M2LUZhNTEwY2lyTDVlckxxdHdmWExhcWR1Mm8xNUZqNXE1eUhPTGdvd28ybWkzVkRsNWZ3MjhYYXh4a2dEaS1zbGd4cGhMZE8tc0dTWlozanh2U3hkYnJBSlpWNGV5UWdsbnNHOWJva2laMXUzei1vTGUzRC0wYU1rbEJhUQ</guid></item><item><title>“它看起来无害，但它很危险” ：人们正在分享我们所有人所做的常见事情，这些事情实际上是超级危险的-雅虎 | "It Seems Harmless, But It's Dangerous": People Are Sharing The Common Things We All Do That Are Actually Super Risky - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNVlN2UFhSU0YtZnM4YlhLNVB0Vm1qZzJrS2pRMjg4dHd5OWczRzBXb015cHAxUDBVUkJjTGR6QWJOakJxa1hIX1RjXy1DbXFxUmJMYV9VclJpa01aWUoyQ2wxOU5pSzdNNS1QM1FCODdseVRIaDZtdTNEQ1huam5LZjE5bWpZeGtmckU3d3NNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you're like me, and spend too much time listening to people yap on TikTok, you've probably come across a few "Things I Would Never Do As A..." videos, wherein people, such as doctors, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@travelingnurse/video/7210784199446498603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nurses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nurses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyspinedoc/video/7121359501004901675" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurosurgeons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;neurosurgeons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zemparamedic/video/7151201954079771946" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paramedics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt;, share the things they would never do as experts in their fields.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I always find their takes so enlightening and fascinating, so I thought &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/harmless-things-that-are-actually-dangerous" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'd also ask the BuzzFeed Community;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;I'd also ask the BuzzFeed Community&lt;/a&gt; to share with me all the seemingly harmless, but possibly risky things we all do way too often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had everyone from car mechanics to attorneys to everyday people write in.

I would have to say disregarding the condition of your vehicle's battery can seem harmless, but can be very dangerous. If you hear a clicking noise when you turn the key in your car's ignition, it could be an indication of a more serious problem with your car battery. Those batteries work off of a chemical reaction and make hydrogen gas, which then vents in fairly large quantities into your hot engine compartment full of hot metal, explosives, flowing electricity, and sparks... hydrogen is SUPER flammable!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The white crust on the outside of an older battery is the corrosive acid eating the metals, so you can bet if that acid is getting out, hydrogen (which is the smallest molecule that we know of) is getting out.

She added that she always wore SPF and has never been a 'sun-worshipper'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kerry-Ann initially dismissed the main red-flag sign of skin cancer, a growth or unusual patch on the skin, assuming it was just a pimple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kerry-Ann was self conscious following her surgery but is now using her platform to raise awareness for the subtle signs of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite lockdown restrictions, Ms Buckell was seen quickly and, following a biopsy, she was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma—a common form of skin cancer, affecting around 75,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Buckell had missed the main symptom of the disease— a growth or unusual patch on the skin, which usually affects areas that are exposed to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, as is usually the case with basal cell carcinoma, unlike ultra-deadly melanoma, it had not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had read about people who loved being in the sun who had got skin cancer, but that wasn't me, so it left me very confused when they confirmed my diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It hadn't spread. But the realisation that I had cancer was hard to swallow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biopsy removed the growth and Ms Buckell recovered well—until three years later in November 2024, when she noticed another spot on the side of her nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She tried to burst it with her fingers, but the spot would not stop bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I noticed another spot, this time double the size, that wouldn't budge'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kerry-Ann is a single mother, to her son Albie, who was just 10 months old when she was first diagnosed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kerry-Ann now wants to do everything she can to encourage skin safety, warning her clients of the dangers of sun exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two weeks later, the spot was still there, and, as a single mother to her 10-month old son Albie, Ms Buckell was becoming increasingly concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As much as I tried to stay in denial, I knew what it was', she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hairstylist was referred to a dermatologist who confirmed that the cancer was back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Buckell had the disease removed, which left her with a big black hole on the side of her nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This time, it was much bigger,' she said. 'It was scrapped off and I was left with a big gaping black hole on my face that made me really self-conscious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Buckell's nose has since healed and she has recently opened up her own hair salon after taking a course in trichology—the study of diseases and disorders of the hair and scalp—to help her understand warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also checks her client's scalps for any signs of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never did I think skin cancer would appear as a regular looking spot', she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm now doing everything I can to encourage skin safety.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now urging people to take precautions before heading out into the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It might leave you glowing at first, but it could result in your life being on the line.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It takes a scarily low number of sunburns – only five – to make you vulnerable to skin cancer, which kills more than 2,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadliest type is melanoma, which penetrates into the deep layers of the skin and can spread to other organs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-melanoma skin cancers, like basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, are slow growing, starting in the top later of skin, meaning that doctors can almost always cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include a spot that won't stop bleeding—due to the fragile nature of the tumours—a bump that appears darker than the surrounding skin, and crusty patches of skin that feel rough or itchy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst this type of skin cancer is relatively harmless, patients often have to undergo invasive operations to remove large chunks of their skin, in order to remove the cancer—which in some cases can be disfiguring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most harmful type of sunrays are UVB rays which hit the outer most layer of the skin and cause sunburn, as well as UVA rays which penetrate much deeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both of these are ultraviolet, meaning they can cause skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A worrying 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of sunburn and using sunbeds, according to Cancer Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But too often, people delay getting help because they’re unsure whether their symptoms are serious. This hesitation can lead to dangerous outcomes, especially for stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/giving-patients-these-two-drugs-after-a-heart-attack-could-save-thousands-of-lives/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; patients. Both conditions are leading causes of death, and the time between the first sign of trouble and medical treatment—often called the “golden hour”—can decide whether someone recovers fully, survives with a disability, or dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are working on a tool that could change how people respond to these emergencies. A new &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-smartphone-app-successfully-treats-tinnitus-in-clinical-trial/"&gt;smartphone app&lt;/a&gt;, known as ECHAS (Emergency Call for Heart Attack and Stroke), helps people decide when to seek emergency medical care. Built with insight from neurologists and cardiologists, the app is meant to catch heart attacks and strokes early, when treatment works best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="closing_the_delay_gap_in_emergencies"&gt;Closing the Delay Gap in Emergencies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, the problem isn't just knowing what to do—it's knowing when to act. Studies have shown that most patients experiencing a stroke or heart attack fail to recognize their symptoms as life-threatening. This delay in calling 911 or going to the hospital often results in missed opportunities for treatment that could save the brain or heart muscle from permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Screenshots of ECHAS (Emergency Call for Heart Attack and Stroke) including stroke question, myocardial infarction question, finger-tapping, and final suggestion.

For heart attacks, early blood flow restoration—called reperfusion—can lower the chance of death and long-term &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/hidden-muscle-fat-significantly-raises-heart-disease-risk-study-finds/"&gt;heart damage&lt;/a&gt;. But this kind of care depends on quick decisions and fast action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue is even worse in communities with limited access to healthcare or where patients face economic or language barriers. Prehospital delays are a big reason why health outcomes are unequal. Solutions that help close these gaps, like ECHAS, could improve care for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="from_emergency_room_to_app_store"&gt;From Emergency Room to App Store&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECHAS app was designed by researchers from the &lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia Health&lt;/a&gt; system, &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northeastern University&lt;/a&gt;, among others. It simulates the questions a neurologist or cardiologist would ask in an emergency room, but delivers them directly to your phone. The app asks about symptoms, medical history, and includes a simple finger-tapping test. This test can reveal weakness on one side of the body—a possible sign of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gathering this data, ECHAS calculates a risk score. It then tells the user what to do next: call 911 immediately, speak with a medical hotline, or contact a primary care doctor. This approach is designed to balance sensitivity and specificity. In medicine, sensitivity means catching every possible emergency case, even if it means some false alarms. Specificity means avoiding unnecessary panic. While both are important, early versions of tools like ECHAS focus on sensitivity to avoid missing real emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart attack and stroke are two leading &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fatty-liver-disease-doubles-risk-of-death-from-several-diseases/"&gt;causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia and the U.S.,” said UVA Health neurologist Dr. Jonathan R. Crowe, who helped lead the study. “We hope ECHAS could help save lives by reducing delay and helping patients get the heart attack and stroke care they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="testing_the_app_in_real_life_settings"&gt;Testing the App in Real-Life Settings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if ECHAS could really work, researchers tested it in a hospital setting with 202 emergency room patients. These patients used the app after they had already been examined and treated. Of the group, 57 had stroke symptoms and 145 had heart attack symptoms. The average age was 62, and more than half were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app accurately identified all patients who later needed to be admitted to the hospital. That’s a sensitivity rate of 100%—a strong result in early testing. It also worked fast: the app flagged &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-blood-test-could-revolutionize-stroke-diagnosis-and-treatment/"&gt;stroke symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in under two minutes and heart attack signs in about one minute. These quick responses could make a critical difference outside the hospital, especially in rural areas or crowded cities where emergency services may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In heart attack and stroke care, time can make the difference between life and death,” said Crowe, who also works in the UVA School of Medicine’s Department of Public Health Sciences. “We need solutions like ECHAS that are accurate, fast and easy to use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another positive sign? People found the app easy to use, even without medical training. This makes it a promising option for widespread use among people who may hesitate to go to the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/12-year-old-boy-reunites-with-hospital-ship-that-transformed-his-life-a-decade-ago/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; or can’t tell if their symptoms are serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="toward_widespread_access"&gt;Toward Widespread Access&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app isn’t on the market yet, and the researchers are clear that more testing is needed. They hope to run larger trials and improve the tool based on feedback. Funding from early backers, including JanaLee Cherneski and Ian Desai, made the first study possible. Now, the team is working with UVA’s Center for Telehealth to apply for a grant that would allow further study within Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Distribution of the ECHAS (Emergency Call for Heart Attack and Stroke) score and appropriateness scale score (ground truth) with the median indicated by the blue line in 202 study participants.

By providing an evidence-based, medically guided decision tool right on a smartphone, ECHAS could help solve one of the biggest problems in emergency care: hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people wait too long to seek help, it’s not just a personal risk—it puts strain on &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/heart-disease-risk-closely-linked-to-biological-age-study-finds/"&gt;healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt; and increases costs. Early treatment leads to better outcomes, shorter hospital stays, and less need for rehabilitation. So a tool that prompts faster care could have far-reaching effects on public health and health equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crowe is hopeful. “We want people in Virginia and around the world to be able to use their smartphones and tablets to reduce delay and help them get the care they need, especially in medical emergencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings were published in &lt;a href="https://formative.jmir.org/2025/1/e60465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JMIR Formative Research&lt;/a&gt;.

Using large-scale genetic data, the researchers found overlapping biological pathways—especially those related to immune system function—between disorders such as depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and both COVID-19 infection and hospitalization risk. These findings suggest that the link between mental illness and vulnerability to COVID-19 may stem not only from environmental or behavioral factors, but also from shared genetic foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on mental health around the world. But long before the virus disrupted daily life, researchers knew that people with psychiatric conditions tend to experience worse physical health outcomes in general. Over the course of the pandemic, several studies confirmed that individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders were more likely to contract the virus, experience more severe symptoms, and face higher mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raised the question: is the link between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 outcomes solely due to environmental or lifestyle factors, such as living conditions, medications, or health behaviors—or are there shared biological underpinnings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this possibility, a team of researchers from institutions in Spain and Australia conducted an in-depth analysis using data from the largest available genome-wide association studies. These studies identify common genetic variants that are more frequently found in individuals with specific traits or conditions. The team focused on seven psychiatric disorders: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. They also included a general “P-factor,” which represents a shared genetic liability across mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared these datasets with two COVID-19 outcomes: confirmed infection and hospitalization. Importantly, the researchers did not just look at whether the disorders and COVID-19 were linked—they tested whether there were shared genetic variants and whether those variants might play a causal role in increasing susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analyses revealed significant genetic correlations between depression, ADHD, PTSD, and the P-factor with both COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. Anxiety also showed a positive correlation with hospitalization, but not with infection. In contrast, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder did not show significant genome-wide associations with COVID-19 outcomes, though local overlaps were still detected in specific regions of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand where these overlaps occurred, the researchers divided the genome into over 1,700 independent regions and used a method called pairwise GWAS to identify which regions were shared between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 traits. They identified several specific genomic regions that appeared to be causally shared—mostly located on chromosome 17, a region already linked to immune and neurological functions. These regions contained genes involved in immune response, stress regulation, and thyroid function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable gene identified was &lt;strong&gt;THRA&lt;/strong&gt;, which is involved in thyroid hormone signaling. It was found to be shared between depression, bipolar disorder, and COVID-19 infection. Dysfunctions in thyroid hormone receptors have been linked to mood disorders and immune deficiency, which could explain how this gene contributes to both psychiatric conditions and vulnerability to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another gene, &lt;strong&gt;CRHR1&lt;/strong&gt;, was shared between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and COVID-19 hospitalization. CRHR1 plays a central role in the body’s stress response and also affects immune regulation. This dual role suggests that individuals with altered CRHR1 function may be more vulnerable to stress-related psychiatric disorders and at the same time experience an impaired immune response to viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene &lt;strong&gt;BPTF&lt;/strong&gt;, linked to immune cell function and neurodevelopment, was shared between the general P-factor, depression, PTSD, and COVID-19 hospitalization. This convergence hints at the possibility that common disruptions in immune regulation may increase both the risk for psychiatric conditions and the likelihood of serious complications from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go a step further, the researchers also used causal inference methods to explore whether genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders could directly increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. These methods mimic randomized controlled trials by using genetic variants as natural experiments. They found evidence suggesting that depression, ADHD, and PTSD might causally increase the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. PTSD and the general P-factor also showed evidence of a causal effect on hospitalization risk. Interestingly, bipolar disorder appeared to be linked to a slightly reduced risk of hospitalization, though this finding was not consistent across all statistical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored potential drug interactions with the identified genes. For example, CRHR1 interacts with medications like fluoxetine—an antidepressant that has shown anti-inflammatory effects in some studies—and corticosteroids like budesonide, which are used to treat respiratory conditions. This opens up the possibility of repurposing existing medications to improve COVID-19 outcomes among people with psychiatric conditions, especially those who may be genetically predisposed to worse illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these compelling findings, the study has several limitations. All of the genetic data came from people of European ancestry, so the results may not apply to other populations. Some of the psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and ADHD, may have lacked sufficient statistical power to detect certain effects. And while genetic methods can suggest potential causal relationships, they rely on assumptions that can be difficult to fully verify, especially when datasets share overlapping participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex differences were not examined due to data constraints, and other important variables like body weight or vaccination status could not be included. The study also did not examine complex interactions between genes, which may play a role in shaping both mental health and infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this research offers a new perspective on the biological relationship between mental illness and infectious disease. Rather than viewing the increased vulnerability of people with psychiatric disorders to COVID-19 as a purely social or behavioral issue, the findings suggest that underlying genetic factors—especially those linked to immune system function—may play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02643-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Genetic analyses point to alterations in immune-related pathways underpinning the association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Anna Monistrol-Mula, Santiago Diaz-Torres, Mireia Felez-Nobrega, Josep Maria Haro, Sarah E.

Suffice to say, this is the latest in a long line of putative health benefits for vitamin D supplementation, most of which have failed to live up to the initial hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Time to declare my interest: despite my scepticism, vitamin D is the only supplement I take. To be candid, I have no idea whether a) I need it and b) if it is doing me any good, but I am well aware that low levels of the vitamin are associated&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; with an increased risk of developing health issues ranging from rickets and osteoporosis, to stroke, heart attack, cancer and diabetes. Plus most of us in the UK should be taking supplements, according to longstanding guidance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although best known for its action on bones, vitamin D receptors are found on cells throughout the body, including the immune system, so adequate levels are thought to be vital for much more than a healthy skeleton. While foods like oily fish, eggs and artificially reinforced powdered milk, bread and breakfast cereals can supply some of our daily requirements, most — about 80 per cent — comes from internal production in our skin, driven by the action of sunlight. Hence the nickname “sunshine vitamin”. However, in the UK the sun isn’t powerful enough for much of the year to fuel the process and levels dip dramatically in the darker, cloudier winter months. And the further north you live in the UK, the bigger the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/vitamin-d-supplements-ageing-cch2j258r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin D supplements could counter ageing, study suggests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All of which is compounded if you have dark skin, or cover up/use high SPF sunscreens to protect yourself. Little wonder, then, that deficiency is common. Estimates vary but guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggests that over the whole year about 23 per cent of 19 to 64-year-olds in the UK have vitamin D deficiency (a blood level under 25 nmol/L), rising closer to about 40 per cent between January and March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hence long-established, yet widely ignored, guidelines advocating that everyone takes supplements (typically 10mcg or 400iu a day over the age of one) from October to March, and throughout the rest of the year for other groups such as children, pregnant women, those who don’t see much sun or have darker skin. I follow this guidance, but is it doing me any good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Just because lower levels of vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of a range of illnesses doesn’t mean that supplementation will protect against them. Numerous trials have concluded just this, with the consensus being that taking extra vitamin D doesn’t, in general, significantly reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke, or of developing cancer, and autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Covid is one example of this apparent paradox. While research during the pandemic suggested that people with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to develop serious chest complications, it’s still not clear if supplementation improves outcomes (some studies suggest it does, others that it doesn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are a number of reasons that the results of much of the research into protective effects of vitamin D have been inconclusive or disappointing. Low levels of the vitamin can be a marker of poor general health — they tend to be lower in some higher-risk groups such as the obese and those with some types of kidney and liver disease — and supplements won’t change this. There is also still some controversy over what constitutes healthy levels, with a large grey area between recognised deficiency and normal readings. And many of the studies include people with varying levels of the vitamin (some normal). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Could part of the problem be that supplements may help to ward off long-term illnesses in the minority at the lower end of the spectrum, while doing little or nothing for the majority towards the upper end? We know that they work well in extreme examples like rickets (where the bones “soften” due to vitamin D deficiency), but that doesn’t automatically translate into a stronger skeleton for the rest of us. Or, as a vitamin D researcher once told me “putting more petrol in your car won’t make it perform any better, Mark, but you don’t want to run out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I am clear on one thing: vitamin D deficiency is best avoided and it is common. So I will carry on taking my supplements (I take 20mcg/800iu of D3 a day) during the darker months. They are cheap, and safe in sensible dosage. And I would advise that you do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;To test, or not to test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• My local NHS laboratory uses the following reference ranges for vitamin D blood tests. Over 50 nmol/L = adequate, 25-50nmol/L = insufficiency, under 25 nmol/L = severe deficiency.&lt;br&gt;• Nice advises against routine testing of vitamin D levels unless someone has suspected or confirmed osteoporosis and other bone disease, or unexplained chronic widespread pain. &lt;br&gt;• Rather than test those at high risk of deficiency because of lifestyle or underlying medical conditions, Nice says they should be advised to take supplements.&lt;br&gt;• If you still want to know your level, DIY home tests are available. Boots sells one for £7.99.&lt;br&gt;• Recent research suggests that weaker sunscreens (SPF15 or below) do not interfere with vitamin D production in most users (you need surprisingly little sun exposure to meet demand). Higher SPFs do — another reason to consider supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxPREJjel96N0JjRHBXWFJOTUdxVlpLYXl6elB1bUV4QjdEaGRKNzJvX0tZMXY1TWhnMDY0WUtpa1BLdUo4c0N0RktEU1BGWFFOTDFXNEZzRllWbVhESjdueGlEYzhsU2NjNjNHbl81WFJ3TkhEZVBHWWlSX1JkVy1hOVJ2RWV3NzhYREswaERTNWVfVnp5a1BnSWNzdjQ2WVQ2T3JTMmkxcWRLamhHMUxiby1Ca09kX055OWFjNmcyeDVpZjQ3Z0E</guid></item><item><title>罗氏将针对超级细菌的抗生素转移到测试的第三阶段-路透社 | Roche moves antibiotic against superbug into Phase 3 of testing - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxNYUlxYnUxVndvSGhMcE1tM3FwSnFwYnYtdjFZSkJvaWhQNC1FRV9YeFdoWWRHOUZRc2x5QnFXZk1kU2VEWm1haFU2Y3hMcE5QTHA3MDMtVlUzTmpwOFo3YkhjS0tMT2VyTUpOVlp3VF9HR1dOUFcxV1BCX29QU3ZDR0FDRUJseHVZWVQtN3NfV0xFeUFJYjdMU1ZJckltdzBHT0FNblhmeXg4blk4Mzh2SEJhai1UVjFwek1FTndFcHZKaE45eGhDVkxoLXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 15:44:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxNYUlxYnUxVndvSGhMcE1tM3FwSnFwYnYtdjFZSkJvaWhQNC1FRV9YeFdoWWRHOUZRc2x5QnFXZk1kU2VEWm1haFU2Y3hMcE5QTHA3MDMtVlUzTmpwOFo3YkhjS0tMT2VyTUpOVlp3VF9HR1dOUFcxV1BCX29QU3ZDR0FDRUJseHVZWVQtN3NfV0xFeUFJYjdMU1ZJckltdzBHT0FNblhmeXg4blk4Mzh2SEJhai1UVjFwek1FTndFcHZKaE45eGhDVkxoLXc</guid></item></channel></rss>
