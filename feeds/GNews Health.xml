The kidneys play a critical role in filtering waste, balancing fluids, and maintaining electrolyte levels in the body. Poor dietary choices, particularly at breakfast, can place unnecessary strain on these vital organs. While breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, not all options are beneficial for kidney health. Some common breakfast foods can exacerbate kidney issues, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Understanding which breakfasts to avoid can help protect renal function and support long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How To Know If You Have Kidney Stones?

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/press-room/ultra-processed-foods-lead-to-higher-risk-kidney-disease-new-study-finds" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in the National Kidney Foundation found that higher consumption of processed meats was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to their high sodium and phosphorus content. These meats are high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of kidney disease over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, processed meats contain preservatives like nitrates and nitrites, which have been linked to kidney strain. Regular consumption may also contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress, further burdening the kidneys and increasing the likelihood of long-term complications. For individuals with compromised kidney function, consuming these products can accelerate kidney damage. A healthier alternative is to opt for fresh, unprocessed protein sources, such as eggs, legumes, or plant-based options, which provide nourishment without overloading the kidneys. Limiting processed meat intake and focusing on a kidney-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can further support long-term kidney function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugary cereals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary cereals are convenient, but their high sugar content and artificial additives can negatively affect kidney health. Excessive sugar intake can contribute to obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are major risk factors for kidney disease. Moreover, these cereals often lack essential nutrients, providing empty calories that fail to support overall health. Swapping sugary cereals for whole-grain options like oatmeal, bran flakes, or muesli can provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, promoting better kidney function while keeping you full and energized throughout the morning, while also stabilizing blood sugar levels, supporting heart health, and reducing long-term risks associated with chronic lifestyle-related conditions. Over time, replacing processed cereals with nutrient-dense alternatives also helps maintain digestive balance, supports immune resilience, and lowers inflammation, offering comprehensive benefits that extend beyond kidney protection and overall metabolic health. Including fresh fruits, nuts, or seeds as toppings further enhances nutritional value, boosts antioxidant intake, and offers natural sweetness without overloading the body with harmful refined sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which breakfast food do you think is most harmful to kidney health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flavored yogurts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt can be a healthy breakfast option, but flavored varieties often contain added sugars, artificial flavors, and phosphates that may silently strain the kidneys over time. High sugar intake contributes to weight gain, insulin resistance, and metabolic issues, all of which increase the likelihood of developing kidney-related problems in the long run. Phosphates, especially those found in processed dairy products, can disrupt mineral balance and harm renal function when consumed frequently or in large amounts. Regular overconsumption of these additives not only burdens the kidneys but may also trigger low-grade inflammation, raise blood pressure, and aggravate existing conditions like diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular disease. Choosing plain, unsweetened yoghurt and pairing it with fresh fruits, chia seeds, or a handful of nuts delivers beneficial probiotics, essential vitamins, and nutrients that support both digestive and kidney health, without the risks. It also helps maintain gut microbiome diversity, improves nutrient absorption, and supports sustained energy and mental clarity throughout the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pastries and baked goods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastries, muffins, and donuts may be tempting, but they’re loaded with refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and simple carbohydrates, making them poor choices for kidney-friendly breakfasts. These ingredients cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and increase the risk of obesity, which in turn puts extra pressure on already vulnerable kidneys. To make matters worse, many commercial baked goods also contain hidden trans fats that trigger inflammation and gradually compromise kidney function. Smarter alternatives include whole-grain muffins, homemade baked treats with natural sweeteners, or options prepared with minimal oil, which can satisfy morning cravings while still supporting long-term renal health and overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches are convenient but often come with excessive sodium, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. These components can elevate blood pressure, increase cholesterol levels, and strain kidney function over time. Processed meats combined with refined bread further exacerbate these risks, leaving the body more vulnerable to lifestyle-related diseases. Preparing a homemade breakfast sandwich with whole-grain bread, fresh vegetables, and lean protein offers a safer, more nourishing alternative. This approach maintains the convenience of a quick breakfast while supporting kidney health, boosting overall nutrition, and reducing long-term risks associated with processed fast food options. Thus, it is best to avoid or consume in moderation whenever possible, as regular dependence on such meals may gradually weaken metabolic balance, compromise heart health, and increase overall vulnerability to chronic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instant noodles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant noodles may seem like a quick breakfast solution, but their high sodium content poses a significant risk to kidney health. Flavor packets often contain salt and MSG, which can cause dehydration and increase blood pressure—both harmful to renal function. Over time, regular consumption of such high-sodium foods can contribute to kidney strain. Instead, preparing a homemade soup or noodle dish with low-sodium broth, fresh vegetables, and lean protein provides a nourishing, kidney-friendly start to the day without compromising taste or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also Read: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/aiims-gastroenterologist-reveals-10-gut-friendly-snacks-for-daily-health-and-digestion/articleshow/123844292.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;AIIMS gastroenterologist reveals 10 gut-friendly snacks for daily health and digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fruit juices&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial fruit juices, while often marketed as healthy, can contain high levels of added sugar and lack the fiber found in whole fruits. These sugars contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and elevated blood sugar, all of which negatively affect kidney health. The absence of fiber also causes rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Choosing whole fruits or making your own low-sugar juice allows you to enjoy the natural benefits of fruit while preserving kidney function and supporting overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pancakes and waffles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancakes and waffles made from refined flour and topped with syrup are high in simple carbohydrates and sugars, which can lead to weight gain and increased blood sugar. Syrups and toppings often contain high fructose corn syrup, which can further stress the kidneys. Opting for whole-grain versions and topping them with fresh fruit or a dollop of plain yogurt can make these breakfast favorites more kidney-friendly, offering balanced nutrition without compromising flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-that-often-go-unnoticed-according-to-a-top-ny-cardiologist/amp_articleshow/123864579.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read more: High blood pressure symptoms that often go unnoticed according to top NY cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;If this inspires you to curb your drinking, there’s a variety of directions to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, if you suspect you have alcohol use disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;talk to your doctor&lt;/a&gt; or a mental health professional who is trained in substance use. &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt; maintains a database of mental health professionals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to cut back or cut out drinking, the experts who spoke to HuffPost gave a few tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you normally have three drinks on a Saturday, have two, Martinez said. Or, if you drink every night of the week, reduce the number of nights you do drink, Martinez suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might want to have more days where they just don’t drink at all ... and having no alcohol days is a good thing,” Martinez added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your drink’s percentage or Alcohol By Volume (ABV) number is also an important factor. “It’s not just how much you drink, it’s ... how much alcohol is in it,” said Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many craft breweries make high-percentage IPAs, which are often 8% or even 9% alcohol, much more than what’s considered to be a standard drink, which is a 12-ounce 5% beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you drink one high ABV beer, you’re having the equivalent of one and a half standard drinks. If you have two high ABV beers, it’s the same as having three standard drinks, Martinez said. “Having lower ABV beverages can also be a way to cut down. You just want to reduce the amount of pure alcohol that you’re getting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a wide variety of non-alcoholic beers, wines, and &lt;a href="https://tasty.co/article/hannahloewentheil/best-mocktails" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt; available at many stores, restaurants, and bars. Instead of drinking booze, you can opt for a non-alcoholic option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheller also recommended listening to podcasts like &lt;a href="https://www.soberpowered.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Sober Powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hellosomedaycoaching.com/podcast/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Hello Someday&lt;/a&gt; and reading books like “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1912023385?tag=buzz0f-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=7941958%2C1%2C10%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober&lt;/a&gt;” for support and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

But scans revealed potential complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her babies were growing but not moving in utero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not happy. I was sick most of the time. I was crying and stressed," Sam said of her third trimester. "We had no clue what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only became clear when the girls were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital leads global breakthrough in childhood cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the doctors, they ran to a corner, and everyone was so shocked in that room," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El and Ally were conjoined - attached at the pelvis.  Medical staff whisked them away before Sam could see or hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described being in shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not able to accept it suddenly when this happened," Sam said. "But then I came to my senses, like, you know, where are my kids?  I want to see them. " &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to visit her girls in the NICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen conjoined twins before, but they were looking so beautiful, so incredible," Sam said. "I started crying, and I was so happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was daunting, overwhelming, and medically challenging, but Sam was happy because El and Ally were so happy. They were joyful babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their parents believed their best life would come through a separation surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For my kids, I was really concerned about their growth, about their life," Sam said. "We were not able to go outside. If we go outside, it was so hard to explain to people around us.  It was so hard to keep our privacy. Everybody wanted to take pictures, to ask questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were health issues as well.  If one of the girls was so sick she had to be hospitalized, the other did too. If one was awake, the other twin couldn't sleep. And their parents knew, as they got older, they would want to be able to walk, run, and play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family was living in the Middle East, and Sam searched the world for the best doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just took my laptop, and I started looking for all the hospitals, articles, and research papers," Sam said. "How many conjoined twins are there in the world? What kind of conjoined twins exist?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family moved to Seattle, and within days, Sam wheeled the girls into Seattle Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, it's not often we get these patients dropping into our clinic in this way," &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" target="_blank" title="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Dr. Caitlin A. Smith&lt;/a&gt; said.  Smith is the co-director of the Reconstructive Pelvic Medicine Program at Seattle Children's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I obviously knew there was going to be a lot of work involved to evaluate them and make sure that we could separate them," Smith said.  "A lot of conjoined twins have organs or blood supply that cannot be separated. It's not safe. One of them won't be able to survive being separated because of their anatomy.  We needed to establish that their pelvic organs could be separated safely. And each of them has, you know, bladder, bowel, and gynecologic function. And so that was the main question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital opens first mental health pediatric urgent care clinic in WA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's assembled a team including urologists, gynecologists, plastic surgeons, and neurosurgeons.  "The team was ultimately about 30 people," Smith said. Counting our anesthesia team, our nursing staff.  We had great scrub techs and circulators in the OR that day that we're lucky to work with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six months, they met monthly to plan. They ran a practice session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally, when the girls were 15 months old, they went into the operating room for an 18-hour surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think about surgery all the time, and we have very focused plans. Patients are very complex, but I've never thought about an operation for six months before," Smith said. "The relief, I think, that they were separated safely was really rewarding for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, months later, El and Ally are quickly learning to use their new mobility.  Sarah Lewis and Maya King are physical therapists at Seattle Children's, working with the girls since they were discharged from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since we've seen them, they've been able to pull themselves up into standing positions and work on standing for the first time," Lewis said.  "We try to make it fun for them, to entice them to do what we're trying to get them to do. So what we're working on is some sitting to standing so that they build strength in their leg muscles and prepare their hip muscles for standing and walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another piece of their development is more emotional.  For more than a year, the twins only knew life together - then one day woke up to this dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were smiling and they were also confused, like 'What's going on and why is she in another crib?" Sam said of the girls' post-operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have different personalities, different likes and dislikes. But there's some way they're still connected with their emotions. They start noticing, 'Where's my sister and why am I here alone,' so I think they always want to be together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be together, but now it's by choice. And Sam has something she initially missed out on as a new mom. When the girls were conjoined, it was very difficult just to hold them. Now, she can finally get her cuddles. "I'm hugging them, and I'm kissing them every time," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all their progress, El and Ally have a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They still have a lot of appointments with the kidney doctors, with urology, with the plastic surgeons, and the developmental doctors.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with rheumatoid arthritis usually depend on drugs to control pain in their joints. But this summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved a different sort of treatment. It's a device that activates the body's own system for regulating inflammation. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on one of the first patients to get this device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: In the summer of 2019, just after her 30th wedding anniversary, Lynn Milam's life took a sudden turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LYNN MILAM: I had bent down in front of my kitchen sink and noticed this unusual pain in my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It was the first sign of rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the lining of joints. Milam says pretty soon, everything hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: My back, my knees, my ankles, my shoulders, my neck - my whole body had become affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Milam tried physical therapy, acupuncture, steroids and even the latest costly immune drugs. Nothing worked. Stairs were a no-go. Even a gentle touch sent pain radiating throughout her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: My children could not hug me. You know, I couldn't hold my husband's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So when her rheumatologist suggested a clinical trial, Milam said yes. The trial involved a device that delivers pulses of electricity to the vagus nerve, which carries signals between the brain and internal organs. Dr. Peter Konrad, a neurosurgeon at West Virginia University, was part of a nationwide study of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER KONRAD: It's the size of a lima bean. I mean, that's pretty cool when you think about an implant. It doesn't have wires going places. Everything's all built on a little chip, and then it's contained in a little silicone jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The stimulator, made by SetPoint Medical, is placed through a small incision in the neck. Konrad says it's a lot like devices used to control epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KONRAD: Neurosurgeons have been putting vagus nerve stimulators in for epilepsy for two decades, so it's not like we didn't know how to put a device on the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: For Milam, the operation itself was easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: I've had dental surgery that was more of a process than this surgery was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: There was a hitch, though. Because the device sits so close to the vocal cords, Milam's voice was temporarily limited to a whisper. A second procedure fixed that, but left her voice slightly lower than it had been. Milam says she'll accept that for a treatment that did what drugs could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: Three weeks in, my elbow pain was completely gone. Then my hands - my hands didn't hurt anymore, the swelling started going away. Everything started, like, going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The idea that electrical impulses could alter the immune system was not immediately embraced by the medical community. Dr. John Tesser is a rheumatologist in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHN TESSER: I, like probably all of my colleagues, was somewhat skeptical (laughter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Then Tesser began to look at how the device works. By stimulating the vagus nerve, it activates a reflex in the brain. That reflex instructs cells in the spleen to stop making inflammatory proteins called cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: This treatment is utilizing the body's own mechanism of managing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It rarely produces the sort of recovery that Lynn Milam experienced. But Tesser says the pivotal clinical trial found that patients who had not responded to even the most powerful drugs often saw meaningful improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: Thirty-five percent of the patients did achieve that in this very difficult-to-treat group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Significantly more than in a comparison group, whose stimulators had not yet been switched on. Tesser says rheumatoid arthritis may be just the first disease treated by stimulating the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: There are implications for all kinds of systemic autoimmune diseases. So we're talking multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: For Lynn Milam, the stimulator has restored her ability to climb stairs, cook and travel. It's also restored a bond with her husband, Donnie, who wanted to celebrate her recovery by renewing their vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: So that's what we did. And that night, to me, meant more than our wedding. It was like a rebirth of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Donnie Milam says he's just happy to be back doing everyday activities with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONNIE MILAM: Walking the dogs, holding hands. Just the simple things. And hugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF SHOPAN'S "LEFT ON READ")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of those patients, 151,180 (33.92%) had a Paxlovid prescription within the treatment period, and 18,663 (4.20%) had been diagnosed as having long COVID.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjusted cumulative incidence of long-COVID estimates were 4.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.40 to 4.66) for treated patients and 4.60% (95% CI, 4.51 to 4.68) for untreated patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a small protective effects among patients aged 65 years or more, the authors said. There was no effect for other ages, and no effect seen between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it may have a small protective effect among higher-risk patients and on certain symptoms, the effect sizes are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although it may have a small protective effect among higher-risk patients and on certain symptoms, the effect sizes are negligible," the authors said. "For example, an absolute risk reduction of 0.43% among patients aged 65 years or more means that 233 people would need to be treated with Paxlovid to prevent one case of PASC [postacute sequelae of COVID-19]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They concluded, "Although some prior observational studies suggested that Paxlovid held promise as a PASC preventive, this study—with a large, nationally sampled cohort; a contemporary study period; and causal inference methodology—found that Paxlovid treatment during acute COVID-19 had no effect on subsequent PASC incidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small risk reduction in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf567/8255716"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In the second study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published today in &lt;em&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that Paxlovid offered some protection against long COVID in a retrospective cohort study where 291,433 treated patients were matched to 582,866 untreated patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was only seen, however, in older adults. A minimal effect was noted in adults ages 18 to 49, but no effect was found in adolescents.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the spring and summer of 2022 (April 1 to August 31) and had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on age (50 years and older) or underlying risk factors. Of 291,433 treated patients, 98,084 (33.7%) had one or more long-COVID symptoms and 40,147 (13.8%) had two or more symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants 65 and older, Paxlovid was associated with a 12% reduced risk of at least one long-COVID symptom (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.90).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger adults aged 18 to 49 years had a smaller 7% reduction in overall risk of long COVID (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95) and a reduced risk of some but not all individual conditions, the authors said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent studies have found that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is underutilized among older patients who are at risk of severe disease, despite the evidence of its benefits," the authors concluded. "Clinicians may consider treatment of persons with mild to moderate acute COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe disease, particularly those aged ≥50 years, not only to prevent hospitalization and death but also to mitigate possible long-term consequences."&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Coronavirus levels in California’s wastewater remain “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;very high&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as they are in much of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while some COVID indicators are rising in the Golden State, others are starting to fall — a hint that the summer wave may soon start to decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the rate at which coronavirus lab tests are coming back positive was 11.72% for the week that ended Sept. 6, the highest so far this season, and up from 10.8% the prior week. Still, viral levels in wastewater are significantly lower than during &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-02/californias-summer-covid-surge-over-how-can-we-prepare-for-next-one"&gt;last summer’s peak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest COVID hospital admission rate was 3.9 hospitalizations for every 100,000 residents. That’s a slight decline from 4.14 the prior week. Overall, COVID hospitalizations remain low statewide, particularly compared with earlier surges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of newly admitted COVID hospital patients has declined slightly in Los Angeles County and Santa Clara County, but ticked up slightly up in Orange County. In San Francisco, some doctors believe the summer COVID wave is cresting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a few more people in the hospitals, but I think it’s less than last summer,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. “I feel like we are at a plateau.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are being hospitalized tend to be older people who didn’t get immunized against COVID within the last year, Chin-Hong said, and some have a secondary infection known as superimposed bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="los-angeles-county" class="subhead"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In L.A. County, there are hints that COVID activity is either peaking or starting to decline. Viral levels in local wastewater are still rising, but the test positivity rate is declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Sept. 6, 12.2% of wastewater samples tested for COVID in the county were positive, down from 15.9% the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many indicators of COVID-19 activity in L.A. County declined in this week’s data,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health told The Times on Friday. “While it’s too early to know if we have passed the summer peak of COVID-19 activity this season, this suggests community transmission is slowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="orange-county" class="subhead"&gt;Orange County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, “we appear to be in the middle of a wave right now,” said Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, deputy medical director of the county’s Communicable Disease Control Division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test positivity rate has plateaued in recent weeks — it was 15.3% for the week that ended Sept. 6, up from 12.9% the prior week, but down from 17.9% the week before that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is still prompting people to seek urgent medical care, however. Countywide, 2.9% of emergency room visits were for COVID-like illness for the week that ended Sept. 6, the highest level this year, and up from 2.6% for the week that ended Aug. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="san-diego-county" class="subhead"&gt;San Diego County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Sept. 6, 14.1% of coronavirus lab tests in San Diego County were positive for infection. That’s down from 15.5% the prior week, and 16.1% for the week that ended Aug. 23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ventura-county" class="subhead"&gt;Ventura County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also still sending people to the emergency room in Ventura County.

But extracting enough of the molecules to serve the entire population would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-e7e3aab0-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; scientists have invented a method to produce these cancer-fighting compounds in a laboratory by using common chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer afflicts an estimated 42,000 Americans every year and kills about 30,000 annually. Incidence rates for the disease &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947621/Liver-cancer-surging-rates-50s-obesity.html"&gt;have more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; since 1980, while the death rates have more than doubled during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William Chain, associate professor in the university's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: ‘The majority of clinically approved medicines are either made from a natural product or are based on one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But there aren't enough natural resources to make enough treatments. Now chemists will be able to take our manuscripts and basically follow our "recipe" and they can make it themselves.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many medicines, both over-the-counter and prescription, have been derived from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6729977/A-diet-rich-grains-slashes-risk-liver-cancer-40-study-finds.html"&gt;natural sources&lt;/a&gt;. Bark of willow trees has been called nature's aspirin. The antibiotic penicillin comes from a mold called Penicillium. And metformin, a common &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e7e24b20-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; medication, was initially derived from the French Lilac plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings provide scientists worldwide with an easy-to-produce and inexpensive method for creating large quantities of the guava's naturally occurring cancer-fighting molecules in the laboratory. It also opens the door to more effective and accessible liver cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using common chemicals, scientists can now produce potent cancer-fighting molecules originally found in guava plants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer deaths among women plummeted through much of the 20th century, but have steadily ticked up to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In men, deaths have remained high since then, reaching 10.1 deaths per 100,000 people with the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally occurring molecule that the University of Delaware chemists synthesized is called (-)-psiguadial A, which has demonstrated a potent ability to stop the growth and division of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists, led by Dr Chain, started by building a key - and complex - component of the cancer-fighting molecule found in the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating the correct 3D shape of the component was crucial because the molecule only works if its shape is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once created, they attached it to another key part of the molecule. This was a major hurdle in the research because the specific spots they had to connect were buried and crowded by other atoms, making it difficult to form a new bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the researchers used a chemical to cause a reaction that made the molecule curl around and connect to itself, forming a special ring-shaped structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ring is the unique, central part of the natural medicine that gives it its power to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A large number of our medicines, including everyday pills and powerful prescriptions, were first discovered in natural sources including fruits (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said that while they have achieved a crucial first step by creating this molecule in the lab, this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanism that allows (-)-psiguadial A to kill cancer cells is still under investigation and the researchers still do not fully understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used measurements of (-)-psiguadial A potency taken from experiments on human liver cancer cells grown in petri dishes. Previous studies on the compound have also used animal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extracts containing these compounds were tested in samples in lab petri dishes against a broad panel of nine other human cancer lines, including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the compound itself has not yet been tested in human patients, though the successful synthesis is the first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still years away from human use, their breakthrough paves the way for developing a potential new class of targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ultimate goal is to create a treatment that is more precise and has fewer harsh side effects than traditional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam O'Grady, doctoral student in Chain's lab and the article's first author, said: ‘We are the first ones to pave that road, and other people can repave it any which way. Find the shortcuts if they have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows cases of liver cancer in women are rising, driven by a rise in obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease, as well as ongoing issues with alcohol and Hepatitis C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liver cancer cases in men are falling, which could be linked to overall lower smoking rates and widespread hepatitis B vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But since we entered into that unknown territory, I think we helped shed light on this unknown pathway that can get us there. And I think that's the cool part.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They now need experts from various fields to help them study, improve, and ultimately determine if it can become a viable medicine for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has zeroed in on the anti-cancer benefits of the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, an international cadre of researchers &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9963020/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization,cytotoxicity%20towards%20cancer%20cell%20lines."&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that a concentrated extract made from guava leaves dramatically slowed down the unchecked growth of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The higher the dose they used, the more cancer cells died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the most potent dose, it stopped over two-thirds of the cancer cells from growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of just poisoning the cells, the extract triggered the cells' built-in self-destruct program, a process called apoptosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It caused a dangerous build-up of toxic waste and shut down the cells' power supply, leading to their collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer is a fast-growing cancer with few highly effective treatment options, which place a multi-billion-dollar financial strain on the US healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, the prognosis for advanced liver cancer is dire, with fewer than 15 out of every 100 patients surviving past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team has partnered with the National Cancer Institute to test the guava-derived molecule against other types of cancer and to develop it further into a potential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:21:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOWkZNbEhmMUNncnYyNGlieGsxc25uQ2UzaWloNG5wUDd3a2g1RjMyNFl3VnJBRGpRX1VVT0ZKOGFLdkxUS2NKT0sta2RFMkE1TkdHdmRETFgxZS1IR0tQUkJMdmxBMWptaTRPSWRqUi1BNEowc0ZLNExkb1lSQ0dFLUV1MkhXUFcydU9OZUk3OGJRVzA30gGaAUFVX3lxTFA5WmlmUDdwQy1VejJ3cFJrRHRJclNSVXY3Q0N3LTVOQ1EyRnN6SGxuZkdVaWdvU1BHVDV2eEwwY0hPelJjQkVNcHZYOFUwOTBwNHBPd3JURmN3Q29VaEpQdEtPNTZDTGFXU3V2OUtBM1VJbC1xTDBOemt2aGFiTE5aUVN2Ukt1QXhpek1sYU8waFg3RTRYbWdqTWc</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic诉讼：关于最新的视力丧失指控，您需要了解的一切-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there were a “drug of the summer” award, Ozempic would win hands down.

Its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, now faces a flood of lawsuits. Patients are alleging a wide range of side effects, from digestive issues to the more alarming claim of irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ozempic remains a focal point of ongoing medical research and cultural conversation, these lawsuits have placed the drug at the heart of a high-stakes legal battle.

As of August 2025, there are 2,190 active cases, with plaintiffs claiming Novo Nordisk failed to adequately warn them about severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vision Loss Is the Flashpoint in the Ozempic Lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/legal/ozempic-lawsuit/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drug Watch&lt;/a&gt; reports that most Ozempic lawsuits initially centered around gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, and cyclical vomiting syndrome. But over time, a growing number of users of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus began reporting a rare eye condition called Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July 2024 study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; found a link between Ozempic use and NAION. Novo Nordisk has argued that many of the diabetic patients involved already faced a heightened risk of vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in February 2025, a follow-up cohort study in the same journal showed a clearer increase in NAION risk among semaglutide users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, twenty-one NAION plaintiffs moved to consolidate their cases in New Jersey state court. This was notable not only because of the severity of the vision claims, but also because Novo Nordisk’s U.S. headquarters is located in Plainsboro, New Jersey. Plaintiffs aimed to challenge the company directly on its home turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus from stomach issues to vision loss has changed the tone of the lawsuits entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gastrointestinal side effects can be managed over time, they rarely result in lasting disability (per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15522-gastroparesis" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;). NAION, on the other hand, can lead to sudden, irreversible optic nerve damage and permanent vision loss, as reported by the &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs suffering from vision loss often face total blindness or an inability to live independently. This makes their stories far more powerful to juries and increases the chances of large verdicts or punitive settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a product liability case is now a broader question of public health and corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Patients Are Saying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg" alt="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." title="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1e5gj8k/help_im_confused_about_the_ozempic_pen_i_have/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the clinical terms and legal jargon, it’s the personal stories that are shaping the Ozempic lawsuits. Some complaints include harrowing details of vision loss that paint a picture of suffering, corporate failure, and Big Pharma profit over patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such story comes from James Norris, a mechanic in his late fifties who was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawsuit-alleges-man-diabetes-became-blind-taking-ozempic-rcna202959" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Norris was later diagnosed with NAION after his dosage was increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old retail worker from North Carolina. She went legally blind after using Ozempic for her diabetes. In a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; interview, she said, “I no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can’t have any sort of independence…All of my hopes and dreams have been dashed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are a stark contrast to the glowing celebrity endorsements and social media hype that promoted Ozempic as a miracle weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNnxUpiuZVs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits have sparked widespread discussion on forums. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1fkmk9l/had_to_stop_ozempic_due_to_eye_issues/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; user said they had to stop using Ozempic due to temporary vision loss. Another shared that their vision became blurry for weeks after a dosage increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are now key in the broader legal and public debate, giving a human face to claims that might otherwise be buried in data and court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is There a Link Between Ozempic and Irreversible Vision Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;While Ozempic has been linked to vision loss through multiple studies and regulatory reviews, a direct causal relationship remains unproven. Research shows an elevated risk of developing Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) among users, but it’s still unclear whether the drug itself causes the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone, which promotes feelings of fullness and triggers insulin release to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/can-ozempic-affect-eye-health-here-s-what-ophthalm" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt; explains that Ozempic may lead to sharp changes in blood sugar, which can alter the shape of the eye’s lens and cause temporary vision issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that semaglutide reduces blood flow to the optic nerve, possibly triggering NAION and resulting in permanent vision damage. This condition is often called a “stroke of the optic nerve” (via &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eye Physicians of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters is the fact that diabetic patients are already at risk for NAION and other eye issues, making it challenging to isolate Ozempic as the direct cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2024 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; study found that diabetic patients on semaglutide were over four times more likely to develop NAION than those on alternative treatments. The risk was even greater among overweight users, a key demographic for Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg" alt="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." title="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-anonymous-woman-on-the-scales-before-her-weight-loss-news-photo/141598984?adppopup=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tina Stallard / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors emphasized that the data showed correlation, not causation, their work supported early plaintiff claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study in 2025 echoed these findings, noting an uptick in vision-related complications among Ozempic users, even those without prior eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; officially listed NAION as a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide. According to the agency, it may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users after a year on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a regulatory body confirms what plaintiffs are alleging, it significantly strengthens their case. The EMA also urged patients to seek medical attention immediately if they notice sudden vision changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts caution that more research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. However, with growing evidence and regulatory acknowledgment, there is already considerable support for the ongoing mass tort litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Legal Battle Is Evolving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most Ozempic-related cases fall under &lt;a href="https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl/mdl-3094-re-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-glp-1-ras-products-liability-litigation" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDL 3094&lt;/a&gt;, a multidistrict litigation focused on GLP-1 agonists. The core allegation is that Novo Nordisk failed to warn doctors and patients about the drug’s severe risks, including permanent vision loss and stomach paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Novo Nordisk is expected to invoke long-standing legal doctrines that often shield pharmaceutical companies. One is the “learned intermediary doctrine,” which holds that the company’s duty is fulfilled once it warns the prescribing physician. The burden then shifts to the doctor to relay those risks to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another likely defense is preemption. The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute&lt;/a&gt; explains this as the idea that federal law, like the FDA’s approval process, can override state-level failure-to-warn claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law firms like Morgan &amp;amp; Morgan, Motley Rice, and Seeger Weiss are leading the charge for plaintiffs. Each firm has a seat on the Plaintiffs’ Leadership Committee and is responsible for proving injury and showing Novo Nordisk knowingly withheld crucial safety information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the MDL, some of the most serious NAION cases have been filed in &lt;a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/notice-multicounty-litigation-application-new-jersey-state-court-litigation-alleging-use-of" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New Jersey state court&lt;/a&gt;, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered. This legal strategy could invoke state consumer protection laws and create a more favorable path for plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to a long, high-stakes legal showdown that could reshape pharmaceutical accountability rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk faces more than mounting legal fees. Its reputation and financial future may be on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early projections from &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; estimate that total payouts from the Ozempic lawsuits could exceed $2 billion. This figure factors in the severity of the injuries, long-term medical costs, lost income, and damages for pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of permanent vision loss into the litigation significantly raises the stakes. These NAION cases are now expected to serve as “bellwether” trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://clp.law.stanford.edu/bellwether-trials/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stanford University &lt;/a&gt;explains, bellwether trials are early cases used to gauge how juries might respond to evidence and arguments. A single major verdict favoring a NAION plaintiff could sharply increase Novo Nordisk’s overall liability and shape the size of future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the outcome of these early NAION cases could determine the trajectory of the entire litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pharmaceutical Industry Is Responding to Mounting Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing billions in potential liability, Novo Nordisk is rolling out a multifaceted strategy to defend itself. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing, maintaining that its GLP-1 drugs are safe when used as prescribed and already carry adequate warnings for known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk has also launched a quiet media push. &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; reports the company is emphasizing that the off-label weight loss boom was driven by social media, exposing users to risks not accounted for in the drug’s intended use. In other words, many injuries may stem from misuse, not manufacturer failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/principles-positions-and-policies/illicit-compounding-position.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt; is cracking down on compounding pharmacies and telehealth clinics that sell unauthorized versions of its medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-files-14-lawsuits-unapproved-semaglutide-drugs/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the company has filed over 132 lawsuits across 40 states and secured at least 44 permanent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These legal moves serve two goals: tackling a public health risk and casting the company as a defender of drug safety. Novo Nordisk has also ramped public education efforts to warn against unsafe compounded products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these actions suggest the company may argue that any harm plaintiffs suffered came not from its FDA-approved drugs, but from unregulated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Broader Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Ozempic’s transformation from a niche diabetes treatment to a cultural phenomenon has sparked wider debates about beauty standards, off-label drug use, and pharmaceutical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg" alt="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." title="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/yeythw/f3952_195155140_lbs_cico_and_ozempic_no_exercise/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/progresspics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s popularity exploded as influencers and celebrities flooded social media with dramatic before-and-after shots, often touting effortless weight loss without the need for exercise or diet changes. &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/celebrities-before-and-after-ozempic/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Celebrity transformations&lt;/a&gt; helped feed the frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This viral demand extended far beyond Ozempic’s approved use, exposing a wider and more diverse population to potential side effects and setting the stage for today’s lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of Ozempic also fits into a larger shift around injectables and cosmetic trends, including procedures like the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lip-flip-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;lip flip&lt;/a&gt; and transformations seen in figures like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/kimberly-guilfoyle-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Kimberly Guilfoyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, weight loss isn’t just aesthetic.

The case was tied to a 4-year-old suburban Cook resident, who is not vaccinated, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child is believed to acquired measles during international travel. CCDPH is working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed, in collaboration with Illinois Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of public exposure occurred Thursday, Sept. 11, in Terminal 5 at O’Hare International Airport, between the hours of 7:30 to 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--mobile__18tT_"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For People Who May Have Been Exposed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who may have been exposed should check with their health care provider if they are unsure about prior vaccination. The health care provider will determine the need for testing if symptoms develop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call a healthcare provider before going to a medical office or emergency department for evaluation to ensure that special arrangement can be made to prevent patients and medical staff from possible exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People that are unvaccinated against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;mumps and rubella (MMR)&lt;/a&gt; and are exposed should talk with their doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps or rubella and doing so may prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people are vaccinated against measles routinely in childhood and are not at high risk. The best defense against measles is vaccination. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles and generally provide lifelong immunity. The first dose should be given between 12-15 months of age; the second between the ages of 4-6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or are unvaccinated will also become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__oN6vv"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can linger in a room for up to two hours and can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kiran Joshi, chief operating officer for the CCDPH, said the case is a critical reminder for residents traveling to areas with active measles transmission to follow &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Ftravel%2Findex.html/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/N3CBU6yA0gJQtMWCto4R5LPrsWbyP-pX2Pul86S-PIM=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated with the MMR vaccine at least two weeks prior to travel. Children between the age of 6-11 months should get an early dose of the vaccine if they are planning on international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses we know, and it’s entirely preventable. This case is a serious reminder that vaccination is not just about individual protection, it’s a critical community responsibility,” Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Simbo Ige said in a news release. “We strongly encourage all Chicagoans, especially families traveling internationally and those working in high-exposure settings, like airports, to review their vaccination records and get up to date. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cook County Department of Public Health offers free MMR vaccines to anyone who needs them. Get more resources &lt;a href="https://cookcountypublichealth.org/communicable-diseases/measles-toolkit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;at the CCDPH measles tool kit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; - Measles symptoms appear up to 21 days following exposure.&lt;br&gt;Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. The rash usually begins on the face and spreads to the trunk. A person is generally contagious the four days before and four days after the onset of a rash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to Get Vaccinated&lt;/strong&gt;- To make an appointment for measles vaccination at a Cook County Health community health center in Chicago or suburban Cook County call 833-308-1988.&lt;br&gt;Unvaccinated individuals who do not have a healthcare provider are encouraged to contact &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fcookcountyhealth.org%2F/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/CCoJDEXA6a02ZXyVYlIzWAv0qHGn2cgpj5VL7zNBuPk=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cook County Health&lt;/a&gt; at 312-864-1111 to schedule a vaccination appointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/publichealth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free MMR vaccinations for anyone who needs them, regardless of insurance status, at CDPH immunization clinics throughout the city. Walk-ins are welcome, but registration is highly encouraged. Create an account and register for an appointment at &lt;a href="http://getvaxchi.chicago.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GetVaxChicago&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Vaccination History&lt;/strong&gt; – The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine for lifelong protection. If unsure, you can check your vaccine history. Immunization records recorded in the Illinois immunization registry can be accessed using the Illinois Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdph.illinois.gov%2Fvaxverify.html%3Futm_source=sfmc%26utm_medium=email%26utm_campaign=CDPH%2BEncourages%2BMeasles%2BVaccination%26utm_term=https%253a%252f%252fdph.illinois.gov%252fvaxverify.html%26utm_id=1333387%26sfmc_id=82407225/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/RWCQ6Bshmq_tEvoyHZmRni4KIwo5XutgmbXIAHzrpNQ=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Vax Verify porta&lt;/a&gt;l.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Your Age &amp;amp; Timing&lt;/strong&gt; – If you were vaccinated before 1968, check with your healthcare provider about a revaccination. A blood test can confirm if you still have immunity. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess Exposure &amp;amp; Risk&lt;/strong&gt; – If you got just one dose, have a weakened immune system, or have been exposed to an outbreak, consult a healthcare provider about immunization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect Yourself from Misinformation &lt;/strong&gt;- Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination. Vitamin A supplementation does not prevent measles infection. It can help reduce the severity of measles symptoms—particularly in malnourished children or those with vitamin A deficiency—but only after infection has occurred. According to the CDC, vitamin A may be used as part of supportive care for measles in some patients, under medical supervision. However, relying on vitamin A instead of vaccination puts individuals and communities at risk of infection, complications, and disease spread&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are frequently around international travelers, such as individuals who work at airports or taxi and rideshare drivers, should also be sure to double-check their vaccination status, as their risk of exposure to measles is heightened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/illinois/oaklawn/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:16:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在预算紧张的情况下，长滩卫生局终止了计划，裁员-长滩邮报</title><link>https://lbpost.com/news/health/amid-budget-crunch-long-beach-health-department-ends-programs-cuts-jobs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p&gt;The Long Beach Health Department is planning to lay off or reassign up to 40 people in a retraction caused by the end of some programs and swift federal cuts announced earlier this year. The department currently employs about 500 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of this week, five people have been laid off, while one resigned and another accepted a part-time position. Fifteen people are pending reassignment, while nine more have been placed elsewhere in the city — mostly somewhere else in the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine positions are on the bubble and could be retained if grant or city funding is secured, according to a Health Department spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the affected jobs are tied to federal funding, and involve health education, HIV-prevention and racial equity programs. Others were a part of temporary programs scheduled to conclude between now and the end of the year. They said announcements about which programs are ending will come later this year.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The looming cuts were announced during a &lt;a href="https://longbeachca.new.swagit.com/videos/353131"&gt;budget presentation&lt;/a&gt; by Health Director Alison King, who informed the City Council that the department has seen nearly $4 million clawed back by the federal government since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;King warned the reductions will stymie the department’s ability to test and prevent the spread of infection, including HIV and AIDS, as well as childhood immunizations and how swiftly it may respond to public health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How impactful this will be remains unclear, said Health Department Deputy Director Erica Valencia-Adachi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as the department faced up to an $11 million deficit this year, fueled by rising labor costs, inconsistent state funding and expensive citywide emergencies for homelessness and disease outbreaks. The department also faces a 28% vacancy rate, King added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Beyond legislative pressures, our health fund faces persisting, compounding cost drivers that strain every program,” King said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The department has also struggled to cover a ballooning cost in administrative overhead on some grant-funded projects — about 50% of which officials say cannot be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are charges that come indirectly with the rollout of a grant program, and can span anything from the cost of electricity and plumbing at a facility, equipment needed to be purchased and the hourly costs of having city accountants file required paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say any staffers losing their jobs will be helped with courtesy review of resumes, interview coaching and internal transfers where possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: This story was updated to show a spokesperson says the Health Department has about 500 employees, not 300 as stated on the department’s website, and to show there were multiple temporary programs concluding, not just one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last year, in a stroke of luck, researchers from the University of Copenhagen stumbled upon them once more, and found a suspect white powder lurking within. This residue, they would go on to uncover, contained bacteria from the 1890s and had once-upon-a-time been used to make butter, thus opening up a window into the Scandinavian country’s dairy-making past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only gate-screenreader--text"&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was like opening a kind of microbiological relic. The fact that we were able to extract genetic information from bacteria used in Danish butter production 130 years ago was far more than we had dared to hope for,” Jørgen Leisner, author of a recent study presenting the findings, said in a &lt;a href="https://food.ku.dk/english/news/2025/stored-for-130-years-bottles-reveal-evidence-of-danish-butter-production-and-hygiene-practices-of-the-past/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a peek at the bottles’ labels, Leisner and co-authors saw that they contained cultures of lactic acid bacteria – microbes that have long been used in food preservation and flavoring. To investigate further, they extracted and sequenced DNA from the samples, comparing it with databases of known bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they discovered traces of the lactic acid bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactococcus cremoris&lt;/em&gt;, which is still used today by Danish dairies to acidify milk and kill harmful bacteria after &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-are-once-again-claiming-raw-milk-is-good-for-you-heres-why-its-not-73159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pasteurization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as this, the researchers identified genes in&lt;em&gt; L. cremoris&lt;/em&gt; associated with dairy adaptation, including those that contribute to buttery flavors – something the team says is interesting given the “mild flavor profile preferred in Danish butter for the English market during the 19th century”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the 1800s, Denmark began shipping butter to England on a large scale. To ensure good hygiene in its products, milk was first pasteurized before adding bacteria – called &lt;a href="https://dairyprocessinghandbook.tetrapak.com/chapter/cultures-and-starter-manufacture" target="_blank"&gt;starter cultures&lt;/a&gt; – which ferment and convey properties of acidity, flavor, aroma, and texture while also having a preservative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The starter culture became the key to standardized butter production. It was no longer possible for each dairy to ferment in its own way – it was necessary to ensure that the products tasted the same, regardless of where in the country the butter was made. The starter culture made the taste reproducible,” Leisner added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found evidence of other, less savory, bacteria in the bottles: they were contaminated with &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acnes&lt;/em&gt; – a skin bacterium that causes acne – and potentially pathogenic bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/stowaway-rat-that-hopped-on-a-flight-from-miami-was-a-wake-up-call-for-global-health-80794" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vibrio furnissii&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, the dairy industry faced some steep production challenges in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the contents of the bottles testify to the standardization of a dairy product that every farming family used to make themselves in a jar of sour milk kept close to the stove. But it also shows that hygiene conditions were still different from those we have today," co-author Nathalia Brichet explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about some &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-worlds-oldest-cheese-has-been-found-rubbed-on-a-bunch-of-mummies-76096" target="_blank"&gt;ancient cheese&lt;/a&gt; to go with your bygone butter?

Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah on Tuesday, accompanied by a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report, produced in collaboration with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, found 70% of Utah’s maternal deaths could have been prevented. Maternal health refers to a woman’s health during pregnancy and for a period of time postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The top three causes of poor outcomes are mental health conditions, substance use disorders and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found many factors, however, that combine to contribute to those poor maternal health outcomes, including both physical and mental health — which has worsened considerably in the last decade — substance use, intimate partner violence, lack of access to maternal health care and social determinants of health like poverty, food insecurity and transportation challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report said — and the panel agreed — that the share of women experiencing each risk factor for poor maternal health outcomes depends on individual situations, including how far they are from maternal health care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In some cases, care is far away in Utah, including five counties where women must travel an hour or more to the nearest birthing hospital. And many women who are far from care are not in a financial position to take time off to travel to doctor appointments that are more readily accessible in urban areas, according to panelist Danielle Pendergrass, a nurse consultant with Eastern Utah Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She listed income and geographic location as the two major barriers to receiving adequate prenatal and other maternity care for those in rural Utah. “It’s a great day when I only had to take a half-day off work to get to my appointment,” Pendergrass said she has been told by women making low wages in her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report also noted that the share of Utah women of reproductive age with physical or mental health challenges has been rising, putting more women at risk of complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Even so, Utah fares better than the national average, with 16 cases of maternal mortality per 100,000 live births, compared to 23 per 100,000 nationally. When it comes to severe outcomes short of death, Utah averages 61 per 10,000 compared to 88 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the Utah birth certificate database in the Office of Vital Records and Statistics, there were nearly 45,000 live births in Utah in 2023, with almost 6 in 10 of the mothers residing in Salt Lake or Utah counties. Of those, just under 83% were delivered by a physician, 13% by a certified nurse midwife, not quite 4% by other midwives and 0.3% by “other.” More than 95% of those births took place in a hospital. But the report notes that seven Utah counties do not even have a birthing hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Where-are-the-risk-factors" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Where are the risk factors?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found that “rates of pre-pregnancy risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are higher in Utah’s rural counties. Over 19% of 2023 Utah births occurred in counties with a high prevalence of pre-pregnancy physical health risk factors. Sexually transmitted infections are another pre-pregnancy risk factor, with rates highest among Wasatch Front counties and San Juan County.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Poor physical health is a greater issue among Utah women in racial and ethnic minority populations and also for those with household incomes below the federal poverty line, per the report. The highest prevalence is in Piute (30.1%), Wayne (24.3%), Carbon (23.5%), Sevier (22.9%) and Emery (22.6%) counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah, the rate of poor mental health rose 18.7 percentage points in 10 years, increasing the risk of pregnancy complications. And mental health challenges are more common among Utah women than the national average. Close to 4 in 10 Utah women of childbearing age have been diagnosed with depression and 1 in 6 experience symptoms of postpartum depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Data show that only 55% of Utah women with symptoms of anxiety or depression before, during or after pregnancy report asking for help from a health care provider,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More than 43% of women ages 18-44 — the range considered of reproductive age — living below poverty experience poor mental health, compared to 34.4% living above that federal poverty line, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Substance use not only negatively impacts outcomes for both mother and baby, but also decreases the likelihood a pregnant woman will seek prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So does lack of health insurance, which is more likely among women in racial and ethnic minority populations than among white women. Lack of insurance is also more likely in rural counties of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As for intimate partner violence, during pregnancy it is linked to maternal depression, anxiety, PTSD and greater risk of maternal death. It also increases the likelihood of giving birth prematurely, low birth weight and fetal injury, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“But the bigger barrier is cultural,” said Kasey Shakespear, executive director of the Rural Health Association of Utah. “We (in rural communities) don’t like to ask for help. We don’t like to bother people,” he said, noting rural residents put themselves last. As for mental health, he said people are even less likely to seek care for fear of being judged harshly. It’s not just access, he said. “You don’t want people to know you struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sarah Woolsey, medical director of the Association of Utah Community Health, called telemedicine a bright spot in providing maternal health care to women who are far away from routine appointments. But she noted that the workforce also needs to be bolstered. So does the social support network. “Women do best when they have a support system,” she said, and that can be built within a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-struggling-workforce" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A struggling workforce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Melanie Beagley, Gardner Institute senior health research analyst, said four Utah counties lack a family physician, 13 have no OB/GYN and 12 have no certified nurse midwife right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Add all those workforce shortages in maternal health — 22 of Utah’s 29 counties are deemed primary care workforce shortage areas although 77% of the mothers giving birth in 2023 resided in them — to the other care barriers and a good maternal health outcome is not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers found that more than a quarter of those who die in pregnancy or postpartum (28.7%) have at least one barrier to accessing care, including not enough money (23%) and access to transportation (14.9%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the report found no category of professional providing an aspect of maternal care that is in surplus, from physicians assistants to nurse practitioners specializing in maternal health care to doulas and community health workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report cites projections that Utah’s workforce will not be able to meet the coming needs for maternal health provision across multiple specialties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s projected that by 2036 there will be enough certified nurse midwives in Utah, but the Beehive State will have just 72% of its needed family practice doctors and 57% of needed OB/GYNs. In 2025, Utah has enough OB/GYNs to meet about 69% of the demand.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And those specialists won’t necessarily be located in areas that promise adequate access. Without change, unmet maternal health needs are very likely to continue, Beagley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most rural counties will probably still have provider shortages, the report said, including in the number of midwives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Shakespear said that Wayne County, for instance, currently has none of those provider types. The health care workforce shortage in some communities goes well beyond maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Family physicians, who can manage uncomplicated pregnancies and a critical part of caring for people with mental health issues and chronic conditions, are predicted to be in inadequate supply as well, especially in rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s all an issue that Ashley Moretz, deputy division director in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said state officials, including the governor, are taking very seriously. He said his department has been very active in trying to plug holes in maternal health care, working with partners including funding sources like the Utah Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said one silver lining in the challenge is Utah’s culture of working together to find solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Data was collected at the county level from many sources, including from groups like the American Medical Association, March of Dimes, hospital websites and more. The Gardner Institute also interviewed maternal health stakeholders to gain insights, including both barriers and challenges, as well as efforts to improve maternal health outcomes in Utah. Those efforts cover a range, from improving mental and physical health care to improving access to substance use treatment. Stories were also gathered about family challenges accessing care, with a focus on population groups that face significant barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVTJXTGtDSGUxLXJGVjA3R0RGTTE2anZWaUJXYlJUUDNwNmpLakZXSDlBMjdtSEVGcVg5SldtMXFtOEVUWmFJQTN3MnFYQl9aT3Z6TzF3M0lka2lQZVVVdldqYVRETEpRUDRJSkExMmxiVTVvNlFnQWJ4dXRaUzluZXcyTWZHX19DcVdMdVB3R0VsNGFvSkRuc2ZTbEw4TzEzNkhGNTB2VjJ4Z05ZUjVYTk5NTkdZU09Sd3lF</guid></item><item><title>贝利在心脏病发作后的恢复中大放异彩： “对我来说最糟糕的部分是节食，试图减轻体重” - BLABBERMOUTH.NET</title><link>https://blabbermouth.net/news/blaze-bayley-on-his-post-heart-attack-recovery-the-worst-part-about-it-for-me-is-the-diet-trying-to-keep-the-weight-off</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="news-content margin__top-xlarge margin__bottom-xlarge"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview with &lt;b&gt;Jorge Botas&lt;/b&gt; of Portugal's &lt;a href="https://metalglobal.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Metal Global&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; singer &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt; once again opened up about his health — two and a half years after undergoing a quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack in March 2023. The 62-year-old singer — who fronted &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; more than two and a half decades ago — said (as transcribed by &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;): "Yeah. I'm so lucky, really. With heart disease, it's one of those things, it creeps up on you. You just feel a bit out of breath here, and things are a bit more of a struggle there, and you don't really start thinking too much about it, but it adds up over time and suddenly you're having a heart attack. It's, like, how did this happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "The main thing, at the hospital, I'd just got in. They put you in this amazing room where they can X-ray you and look at all these things while other people are in the room and everything, and look at all. And they're looking at it and go, 'No, it's not stents. It's gonna need surgery. No, we can't do anything for you here. Put you out on the ward. You wait for the surgeon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a quadruple bypass, and I've made a good recovery," he continued. "I had a little hiccup in my recovery because when I got well enough to exercise and it was safe to exercise, I had a knee injury, and that put me back about five months, really. But, yeah, apart from that, I've got my strength back now, and I've made a good recovery. They discovered that I did have an abnormal heart in that the left side was smaller and somehow it wasn't working the best. And so the right side had been taking up the strain. And they said, with the new plumbing, I might feel an advantage. And I do — compared to what I was before, I've got a lot more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worst part about it for me is the diet — trying to keep the weight off," &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; admitted. "I managed to lose a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of weight with changing my habits and no exercise &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. I managed to lose 30 pounds with no exercise, just by eating sensible and the way that I should have been eating. Bad habits creep back, so I'm having to try again with that. But that's about it. I stopped drinking a while ago, and it was difficult in the beginning, but gradually it's less and less of a challenge over the years, and it was all right. And the diet, to try and stay healthy, it's much tougher to give up chocolate, sugar, biscuits, donuts, sausage rolls, pies — it's much tougher to give up that than to give up booze. I wasn't a raging alcoholic, but with my mental health, I'm, like, 'I've gotta stop drinking because I've drank enough. I'm old enough now. I don't really need another drink.' But then to stop eating pies and all these things — and I start feeling, 'Oh, I feel great now. My knees feel better. Everything feels better now. I've lost all this weight.' And then bit by bit, 'Oh, I'll just have that little treat.' And then, 'My God. I look just like I'm gonna have a heart attack. No!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the worst thing — it's the diet, man. It's tough. And the food industry and Big Pharma [large, multinational pharmaceutical companies] are absolutely complicit in making us fat and giving us heart disease and strokes. Absolutely. They can sue me. Because it's absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The healthiest time in the U.K. was in World War II when people had to have rations, so there wasn't much food," &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; added. "[People] were [at their] healthiest — less heart attack, strokes, less illness, less obesity, less everything. And then when we had — and this is the worst thing — they say, 'Oh, the best thing since sliced bread,' is an expression. Sliced bread is the worst thing. Bread made in a factory is one of the absolute worst things for our health, and they told us, 'Oh, it's the best thing?' No, it's the worst thing. Bread should be made by bakers early in the morning, not in a factory. Anyway, that's me. I had a heart attack and I feel it's partly their fault. I didn't know white bread was poisonous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; fronted &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; from 1994 until 1999. The two &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; albums he appeared on, &lt;b&gt;"The X Factor"&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;"Virtual XI"&lt;/b&gt;, sold considerably less than the band's prior releases and were their lowest-charting titles in the group's home country since 1981's &lt;b&gt;"Killers"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; in 1999, &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; has released a number of albums, including several under the moniker &lt;b&gt;BLAZE&lt;/b&gt; and more than a handful under his own name. He also appeared on 2012's &lt;b&gt;"Wolfsbane Saves The World"&lt;/b&gt;, the first album of new material by &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt; since the group's self-titled 1994 effort, and a follow-up LP, 2022's &lt;b&gt;"Genius"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt;'s latest studio album, &lt;b&gt;"Circle Of Stone"&lt;/b&gt;, came out in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; told &lt;a href="https://www.themetalvoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Metal Voice&lt;/a&gt; about his heart attack: "There's so many lucky things about a terrible incident in my life. I'm at home on Saturday. On the Friday, I've just signed off on what I think is probably the final mastered mix of a new album. That's on a Friday. Here I am on a Saturday. On the Monday, I'm scheduled to go on tour in Europe to continue with &lt;b&gt;'The Man Who Would Not Die'&lt;/b&gt; tour. And there I am, and I've got chest pains, and I think, 'Oh, is this indigestion?' I'm having a heart attack. I live two minutes from the ambulance station. I'm on the phone, and apparently the paramedics, they were going on their break towards the ambulance station and they said, 'Oh, we heard that call. It's on our way. We'll take that call.' Two minutes, they're in my house. I've got wires on my chest. 'You're having a heart attack.' I live in the city, but I'm between four hospitals. In 15 minutes I'm having treatment, and they're injecting me with dye to see what the problems are and everything. So that's it. I'm safe. I'm in hospital 15 minutes later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "They said, the paramedics, if that had been 10 minutes [later], there's no way you'd make it. So I was 10 minutes from death. I had a heart attack, not heart failure. They got to me in time. But if I'd have been somewhere else, if I'd have been in Eurotunnel, if I'd have been in a hotel room alone, or on the autobahn in Germany — anywhere, man… It's just terrifying, really, to think about where I could be. And when they said, 'Oh, you should be able to make it back,' I said, 'I've gotta get back to work. I can't leave it like this.' I've done an album called &lt;b&gt;'War Within Me'&lt;/b&gt;, and I haven't toured the whole thing. I'm thinking of my fans and everything. I thought, 'I can't leave it like this. I've still got more music to make. I've got things to say, and I don't wanna feel like I'm letting my fans down either.' So I was so focused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; added: "It took a while — like a few weeks — before they could put me in for the surgery. It was a quadruple bypass. Basically, they cut you in half. They cut me in half, they do a load of plumbing and then they put you back together. And the guy said, 'We wired you back together with surgical steel wire.' He said, 'We've doubled wired.' I said, 'So even more metal?' Yeah, even more metal. So I've got more metal in me than a normal heart patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what symptoms he experienced prior to suffering his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "It's different for everyone. And this is why it's so confusing. That's why I didn't know I was having a heart attack. My heart attack was a pain that starts — it's like someone sitting on your chest or being kicked by a horse in your chest in slow motion, and it goes from the front to the back and you're sweating and all of this. That's how it happened for me. That's common. The other thing that happens is, for some people — and I didn't have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of this — you start going numb, you start going tingly down your left arm and it spreads across you. That's another thing. And for other people, there are other symptoms. So you just don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding what steps other men can take toward reducing their chances of having a heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "You've gotta try and head it off early by getting tested for your cholesterol, your triglycerides, and all of this. And just exercise is vital, and we just don't realize that. It's vital. I think chronic laziness is one of the things. You get out the van, you get on the stage, I'm active for a couple of hours, breathing all of that, hadn't been away for a while, hadn't done anything for a while. COVID, two years of not going out there all the time. And I think that a big combination of things, and some bad habits, that led up to something that was almost fatal, really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; shared details of the massive outpouring of well-wishes he received after his heart attack, including messages from his former &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing I feel most lucky about is the incredible support I've had from my fans," he told &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;. "All over the world. My &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fans. Everybody bought a t-shirt for a tour that was postponed. They still bought it to support me. I'm just incredibly lucky. And the letters people wrote to me. Hundreds of cards from all over the place. It's very humbling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "I've always put my whole life into music. It is my life. When people get in touch with you and say, 'I wish you well because your music has gotten me through tough times,' 'Your music meant this to me,' 'I first saw you way back when and it's been the soundtrack to my life,' it's incredible. I got a massive card from the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fan club. The [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt;] guys all sent me a message. I'm always in touch with &lt;b&gt;Steve Harris&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bassist] anyway, but everyone sent messages of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, is used to improve blood flow to the heart. A surgeon uses blood vessels taken from another area of the body to bypass the damaged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term quadruple bypass refers to the number of coronary arteries bypassed in the procedure. In other words, a quadruple bypass means four coronary arteries are bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oppa3umPUY?si=Vo6xbKgxndniiskb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BLABBERMOUTH.NET</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:36:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxObE9tbk44OUFVX0pvQ3VOWVQtcEFQUXoyRXhSRWlSU1pYanRCdXdXWVdnTnlZdEh5OXI1VlMzWG9UR1dFYjJxUVV0azIwcW1VVnhQU2p6ZnoxelRGZ3dxeE9SRmM5STNzSFB1SzE1Z2pCaWVXZzh4dk1PaTdRTmlKeUdnNGpyU19DQmoydS0xRXlRUW9uOFZoeU9MRU1Lb2pDdDREUnZsVGdLZ3pfV1VNTVdabXRYMmhXTFpPQWRiZy0xX190T2hMTGUybHN2eVpmSDNiWjYzMURMUHpqd3hrNGNpWQ</guid></item><item><title>催产素促进互惠和同理心-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/oxytocin-reciprocity-empathy-29692/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers developed a fully automated cooperation task showing that rats engage in true reciprocity, not just mutual benefit. Social interaction enhanced success, while dampened interaction reduced cooperative performance. The experience of reciprocity also increased empathy, as rats displayed stronger emotional responses to partners’ distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, oxytocin release in the orbitofrontal cortex underpinned both fair cooperation and empathy, pointing to an internal biological mechanism that prevents free-riding and stabilizes cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocity Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats learned to reciprocate in a structured “pay-first, reward-later” task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin in the orbitofrontal cortex drove cooperation and empathy, reducing free-riding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats with reciprocity experience showed stronger emotional contagion toward their partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Science China Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation in nature can yield immediate mutual benefits or depend on delayed reciprocity. The latter is vulnerable to “free-riding,” where a beneficiary fails to return help, and classical theories emphasize external enforcement (e.g., second- and third-party punishment). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such mechanisms are limited in real-world animal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Science Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Zuoren Wang (CEBSIT, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Yulong Li (Peking University) present a fully automated reciprocal cooperation task in rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two rats, placed in adjacent chambers, must poke their respective ports within a 1-second window to complete a cooperative trial; only one receives water, and the beneficiary alternates randomly across trials—creating a “pay-first, reward-later” structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With training, rats showed robust direct reciprocity rather than mere mutualism, and richer social interaction predicted faster, more successful cooperation; adding a transparent barrier that dampened interaction reduced reciprocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then asked whether reciprocity experience shapes empathy, assessed via an observational fear paradigm. Compared with individually trained controls, reciprocity-trained rats displayed higher emotional contagion toward their partners whether co-housed or separately housed—while demonstrators’ shock responses, observers’ social attention, and 22-kHz calls did not differ between groups, arguing for a specific effect of reciprocity experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe mechanism, the authors combined GRAB-OXT1.0 with fiber photometry recording and found markedly higher oxytocin release in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during reciprocity than during mutualism or individual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, oxytocin-deficient (OXT-KO) rats free-ride more often, were less likely to reciprocate after betrayal, and failed to show the empathy increase seen in wild-type animals—implicating oxytocin-mediated empathy as a key internal brake on free-riding that stabilizes cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings position OFC oxytocin signaling and empathy as an intrinsic motivational pathway complementing external enforcement models of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Project (2022ZD0205100); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB32010300); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX05)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this oxytocin and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d544c434f48446d5e4e444e4544434c034e4240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bei Yan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scichina.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science China Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bei Yan – Science China Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2025.08.042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxytocin-mediated empathy internally facilitates cooperative behaviors in rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Zuoren Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin-mediated empathy internally facilitates cooperative behaviors in rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity is considered one of the vital mechanisms that sustain the evolution of cooperative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, free-riding, where assistance is received but not reciprocated, poses a serious threat to reciprocity behavior, which relies on future payback. Previous theories proposed that third-party punishment plays a vital role in preventing free-riding behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this external mechanism has inherent limitations, particularly in situations where third parties are absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy, the ability to perceive and share the emotional states of others, has long been considered a driving force behind prosocial behavior, yet its role in cooperative behavior remains underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we have designed a new reciprocity paradigm, and demonstrate that rats’ reciprocity behavior can stably establish even in the absence of the external mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, reciprocity experiences can enhance the empathy of wild type rats, but not oxytocin-deficient rats, towards their partners. Furthermore, oxytocin-deficient rats exhibit more free-riding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through fiber photometry recording of oxytocin probe, we found that oxytocin is remarkably released in the orbitofrontal cortex during the reciprocity task, significantly exceeding levels observed in both mutualism and individual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, we suggest that oxytocin-mediated empathy enhancement reduces rats’ free-riding behavior towards their partners, thereby making reciprocity behavior more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This empathy-mediated internal driving force complements the previously proposed external mechanisms, providing new theories and perspectives for understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:51:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFAxbDNMZXg2NDRwdUtOQm5qSXRmQ3ZnS0kyZXg4RGl2X0Y0ekpTdS0xQ0lOZmttNTNxR3JMdTdEVDd0TTFGTEwwa1dsbkM4ZXdLVVVsdUNvSzBKSkJfY1Rsb21lWUtVX0xtYkZDSGZNclJBdw</guid></item><item><title>饮食可以改善MS的健康标志物，但不会影响脑部病变-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/09/16/diets-improve-health-markers-ms-dont-affect-brain-lesions-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) who started fasting or adopted a ketogenic diet — one low in carbs and rich in fat — for 18 months showed reductions in risk factors for heart and metabolic disease that were similar to those who followed a standard healthy diet, according to data from a clinical trial conducted in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The results suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, underscoring their potential as a complementary strategy in the treatment of RRMS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sticking to these diets did not show any differences in the number of new brain &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; among patients, which was the trial’s main goal. The diets were tied to a stable disease course, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were trends suggesting the ketogenic diet may support cognition, and fasting may ease symptoms of depression, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-025-01156-5"&gt;Fasting, ketogenic, and anti-inflammatory diets in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial with 18-month follow-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many patients are willing to incorporate dietary strategies into their care, no specific diet has yet been proven to slow disease progression in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, patients are usually advised to follow broad &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy eating guidelines&lt;/a&gt; — consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables, choosing whole grains and lean proteins, and limiting processed or sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting diets, which involve going without eating for several hours each day, and ketogenic diets, which cut down on carbohydrates and increase fat intake, are both believed to have anti-inflammatory effects. These diets have shown promising benefits in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/02/16/review-larger-ms-studies-needed-evaluate-benefit-intermittent-fasting/"&gt;easing symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/03/09/ketogenic-diet-eases-rrms-symptoms-aids-life-quality-rrms-small-study/"&gt;improving quality of life&lt;/a&gt; in people with MS, but the evidence so far comes mainly from small studies and hasn’t been conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MS patients in trial assigned to 1 of 3 diets for 18 months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, a group of researchers from Berlin conducted a clinical trial — enrolling 105 adults with RRMS — that compared a fasting diet against a ketogenic diet and a standard healthy diet with anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03508414"&gt;NAMS trial (NCT03508414)&lt;/a&gt;, conducted at a single site in the country’s capital city, enrolled participants with active RRMS, who could continue to receive a stable dose of their &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 18 months, participants were asked to follow their assigned diet and participate in 10 group sessions designed to encourage adherence, address any questions, and evaluate compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard healthy diet was based on German nutrition guidelines, encouraging mostly vegetarian meals and aiming for a healthy fat balance to help reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fasting diet included a seven-day fast every six months, plus time-restricted eating on six days per week — 14 hours fasting and 10 hours eating. Participants otherwise followed the standard diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet limited carbohydrate intake to 20-40 grams per day while increasing fat consumption to about 70% to 80% of daily calories, mainly from plant-based sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 18 months, none of the diets met the trial’s main goal of reducing the number of new brain lesions, or areas of tissue damage, the data showed. Further, no meaningful differences were seen in lesion volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers noted that the lack of new lesions across all groups after 18 months represented a favorable result, especially because participants had active disease before joining the study. Nearly half of the participants, however, were on stable DMT, which may have helped suppress new disease activity, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Healthy eating lowered patient risk factors for heart, metabolic diseases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the trial failed to meet its main goal, several secondary outcomes showed encouraging effects. For example, people on the fasting diet reported slight improvements in depressive symptoms after 18 months compared with people on the standard diet. Also, cognitive processing speed improved slightly in the fasting group and had a more noticeable increase in the ketogenic group, while remaining unchanged in the standard diet group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though in different ways, all of the diets lowered participants’ risk factors for heart and metabolic diseases. Such risk factors included body weight, body fat, certain blood fats, and blood pressure — all of which have been linked to worse disease outcomes, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormone levels also shifted in a healthier direction, the data showed. Leptin, usually elevated in MS and associated with more severe disability, dropped in the ketogenic group, while adiponectin, which helps protect against inflammation, rose in both the ketogenic and fasting groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No nutrient deficiencies were observed, and all diets were safe and well tolerated, with side effects mostly mild and transient. No serious health events were linked to the interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS,” the researchers wrote. “These results warrant further investigation in larger and more homogeneous study populations to allow for definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, studies confirm that the position in which you sleep also plays a significant role in human health – especially for your stomach and your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body position changes the path of acid in your esophagus, the way your lungs and diaphragm move, and even the balance of your nervous system. Small tweaks can pay off in comfort and in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One body of work that gets right to the point comes from Daniel Martin Simadibrata of the &lt;a href="https://www.ui.ac.id/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team pulled together the best available evidence on sleeping position and reflux symptoms to see what actually helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared left side sleeping with the right side and with lying on your back. They also looked at whether nudging people to stay on their left side at night would reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-digestion-and-sleep-position"&gt;Digestion and sleep position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-gerd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GERD&lt;/a&gt;) flares when stomach acid flows up into the esophagus. Sleeping on your left side, the left lateral decubitus &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-lateral-decubitus-position_fig1_335584367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;position&lt;/a&gt;, keeps the stomach below the esophagus, which makes reflux less likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37969463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found left side sleeping cut acid exposure time by about 2 percentage points compared with the right side and back sleeping, and shortened acid clearance by roughly 75 to 82 seconds. Those changes were linked with better symptom scores at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current evidence suggests that sleeping on the left side could reduce nocturnal reflux and improve GERD-related quality of life,” stated Simadibrata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis also reported no real advantage of laying on the right side over laying on the back for acid exposure or clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left side sleeping does not fix all reflux by itself. It reduces the odds that acid lingers where it should not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wearing-devices-for-treatment"&gt;Wearing devices for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also tested whether a gentle wearable can train position. In a double blind randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35301135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, a small device vibrated to discourage right side sleeping and encouraged time on the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks, treatment success, defined as a 50 percent or greater drop in the nocturnal reflux score, occurred in 44 percent of the device group versus 24 percent of the sham group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device group spent about 61 percent of the night on the left and only 2 percent on the right, and logged more reflux free nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wearables do not add drug side effects. They simply steer you away from positions that make reflux worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-side-sleep-positions-and-gut-health"&gt;Side sleep positions and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the right side, acid can collect near the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach. The meta-analysis showed longer acid exposure and slower clearance compared with the left, which explains the bump in symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;Sleeping&lt;/a&gt; on your back, the supine position, did not beat the right side for reflux measures. If reflux wakes you, rolling to your left is a simple move that often helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut microbiome is not silent during sleep. A 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183306/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; reported that shorter sleep in older adults was tied to more pro-inflammatory bacteria, while higher sleep quality tracked with more Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causation is harder to prove, but a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using two sample &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00092-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; found specific gut taxa that were causally linked with sleep traits, including sleep duration and chronotype. Some short chain fatty acid producers were associated with longer sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the idea that better sleep habits can improve the mix of microbes that support gut health. They also show why sleep problems can ripple into digestion in ways you can measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-peptic-ulcers-and-night-shifts"&gt;Peptic ulcers and night shifts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift work scrambles the circadian rhythm, and the stomach pays attention to that clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://jhsss.sums.ac.ir/article_50452.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; found that five of eight included studies reported higher peptic ulcer risk in shift workers, with some studies showing more than double the prevalence versus day workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also called for practical fixes at work, like steadier schedules and better meal timing, to reduce risk. That advice pairs well with personal sleep hygiene at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-health-and-sleep-positions"&gt;Heart health and sleep positions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with heart failure, the left side can feel uncomfortable because of pressure from an enlarged, pounding apex of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic 2001 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11401112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found patients with heart failure spent about twice as much time on the right as on the left or back, and the right side normalized an off-balance autonomic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side sleeping also tends to lessen snoring. Back sleeping can worsen sleep disordered breathing, which stresses the heart over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live with a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/easiest-habit-for-taking-care-of-your-heart-and-living-longer-walk-brisk-pace/"&gt;cardiac condition&lt;/a&gt; or have an implanted device, ask your clinician which position works best for your symptoms. Personal advice beats one size fits all rules for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people without heart or lung disease do well on the left for reflux and on either side for breathing. If you have positional sleep apnea, your sleep doctor may coach you toward side &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hijacks-the-brain-disrupting-sleep-and-memory/"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-ways-to-sleep-smarter"&gt;Practical ways to sleep smarter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reflux wakes you, favor the left side and give dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime. Use a pillow setup that keeps your neck and hips supported so your spine stays neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If heart failure makes the left side unpleasant, the right side is a reasonable choice. Keep the room dark, quiet, and cool, and stick to a steady schedule to help your body clock guide healthy digestion and cardiovascular rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:38:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNbWNWbGdWM29DalFvTndPa1VpRVE3d3JBYXJud2pnaTNzSFFqRUxPNUM4aktMRUpEd3I0dEtyZFpwYzA2MHlFUGZ5cmhUbnp3VHNNcFRnV193MEJ5Z1pVR2FNTU1zaEVFemZmcUZ6dGZ2VjFLU0RJSW1Kdmg0WEVpeTlZS19USTVMcjhHWndnQXpTRFB4bGlhSER3RDk</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家认为，这项运动将促进促进大脑生长的“奇迹分子” ，不，它没有运行-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/neuroscientist-suggests-this-exercise-will-give-a-boost-to-miracle-molecule-that-fuels-brain-growth-and-no-its-not-running/photostory/123919912.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The beauty of resistance training lies in its simplicity.

The researchers emphasized how risk rose with more consumption across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Demewoz-Haile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Demewoz Haile&lt;/a&gt; is a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle (&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IHME&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-daily-habits"&gt;Processed meat and daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who were asked to weigh in stressed how steady habits add up over time, and they pointed to the reliability of the pattern across many datasets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ischemic heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Haile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nutrition scientist urged people to limit these foods for the long haul rather than chase perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research, consistent with earlier findings, indicates that the best way to improve health is to avoid or keep intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and industrially produced trans fats as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a Burden of Proof approach, a type of meta-analysis that models how risk changes across the full range of intake while grading the consistency of the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most associations in this paper received two stars in that framework, which the authors describe as weak but still meaningful, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/processed-meat-can-cause-health-issues-even-in-tiny-amounts/"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; and other processed meat and ischemic heart disease receiving one star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose response curves rose steadily, and they rose fastest at the low end of intake. That shape helps explain why small daily portions can move risk in population studies even if the per person effect looks modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-counts-as-processed-meat"&gt;What counts as “processed meat”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat includes products preserved by smoking, curing, salt, or chemical preservatives, such as hot dogs, bacon, sausages, and deli meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IARC&lt;/a&gt;), with colorectal cancer as the main concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages cover regular sodas, fruit drinks that are not 100 percent juice, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12 ounce can is a common serving, and that size showed measurable links with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-these-foods-may-harm-the-body"&gt;How these foods may harm the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats often contain nitrite that can form &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nitrosamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nitrosamines&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that can damage cells in the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High heat cooking of meats can also produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, which have been tied to tumor formation in prior lab and epidemiology work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages deliver large amounts of rapidly absorbed sugar without much satiety, which drives excess calorie intake and strains insulin regulation over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/junk-food-diet-triggers-lasting-changes-in-the-brain/"&gt;trans fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, a pattern known to promote plaque buildup in arteries and increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-evidence-shows"&gt;What the evidence shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational data cannot prove causation, and dietary questionnaires can be imprecise, so caution is warranted when interpreting the size of the effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/mingyang-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mingyang Song&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HSPH&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reminded readers to avoid fear and to keep diet in perspective alongside activity, stress, and access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of recall based diet tools and differences in study design leave some uncertainty, but none of that erases the pattern that higher intake tracks with higher disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-human-health"&gt;Processed meat and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global guidance suggests keeping free sugars to less than 10 percent of daily calories and ideally closer to 5 percent, and that directly targets sugar sweetened drinks, as laid out in a World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guideline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Dietary Guidelines also advise limiting added sugars to under 10 percent of calories across the life span, a point detailed in the federal &lt;a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_dietary_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries are now removing industrial trans fats from the food supply, and the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/replace-trans-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REPLACE&lt;/a&gt; policy provides a template for doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means fewer packaged foods will contain partially hydrogenated oils, but checking labels remains wise because trace amounts can still show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/food/our-staff/gunter-kuhnle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Gunter Kuhnle&lt;/a&gt;, professor of nutrition and food science at the &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress does not require a perfect diet or a strict set of rules. Small, steady changes, like swapping a daily soda for water or seltzer and choosing unprocessed proteins more often, can bring intake closer to those targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNTGdPU3BfUjZFZzhXc0VMTkRlTkxKdFVVNDdVZzNVeU1WSXhpUVFkNkFaMFdObDlTeFNDTGJUUVVSWktod3FMRm1SWjNtRnNDMEJ5aWk4QUNvSmFPX0VBQ2pYelZMU09vUmlaOHdxV0gyRjlKV0d1d0VPWEd2cUpfc29VME9GazMyUkQ2eV82R3BRTDJLOFpWVWRnUjJweHBfU3dkNkZzeGRYa0dCbHYw</guid></item><item><title>什么是日本间歇步行趋势，它真的能让您更健康吗？ -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-15104251/What-Japanese-Interval-Walking-trend-really-make-you-fitter.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas once the ways of getting fit were quite straightforward – going to the gym, heading out for a run etc – nowadays there are all kinds of weird and wonderful workout ‘methods’ gaining traction on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14102137/weighted-hula-hoop.html"&gt;weighted hula hoops&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14559665/10-20-30-viral-exercise-hack.html"&gt;10-20-30 hack&lt;/a&gt;, the internet is constantly coming up with new ways to stay fit and healthy, and one of the recent exercise routines to trend online is called ‘Japanese Interval Walking’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you haven’t heard of it before, you are certainly not alone, but essentially it’s a form of intermittent walking developed by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-137549f0-9317-11f0-9c24-3b2c6714de30"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to improve cardiovascular fitness and your metabolism. In practise, that means repeating the following five times, for a total of 30 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a brisk pace for 3 minutes: About 70-85% of your maximum heart rate. You should be able to speak, but you may find continuous talking a challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a more leisurely pace for 3 minutes and let your heart rate come down to 40-50% of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s not just an internet fad. The Japanese Walking Technique is supported by the research of Dr Hiroshi Nose published in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings.&lt;/a&gt; Compared to continuous walking at the same pace, the researchers found that ‘High-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking is the latest TikTok fitness method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent walking is also an easy method to try out. Jack Claxton, Personal Trainer at&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/"&gt; David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; says ‘switching between a brisk pace and a steadier one’ when you walk ‘is a great way to get more out of something most people already do every day. It gives your heart and lungs a stronger workout, helps you burn more calories in less time, and boosts stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Interval training in general also makes exercise more engaging because the change of pace keeps it varied and less monotonous,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how do you know what counts as high intensity walking? Well, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age from 220. If you are walking with a heart rate at around three-quarters of this number, as measured on a fitness tracker (e.g. a fitness watch), then that’s a good sign, but as Claxton says ‘A simple way to measure this is the “talk test.” If you’re walking quickly enough that you’re breathing heavily and can only speak in short sentences, that’s considered high intensity for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age - aim to be at 70-85% of this number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are ways to achieve this other than simply walking very fast. ‘Walking uphill, or using an incline on a treadmill, is another way to increase intensity without running,’ says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it can count as high-intensity, walking is also low impact, making it much gentler on the joints and more sustainable for most people, especially those who are older or recovering from an injury. ‘It’s also one of the most accessible forms of exercise because it requires no equipment and can easily be built into daily life,’ says Claxton. ‘On top of that, it’s a great stress reliever and often easier to stick to long term compared to more demanding workouts like running or aerobics’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Walking is brilliant for relieving stress, says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should ditch other forms of workout in favour of walking. ‘While walking is excellent for cardiovascular health, it doesn’t build strength or improve mobility on its own,’ says Claxton. ‘As we age, resistance training becomes crucial for maintaining bone density, reducing the risk of falls, and preserving independence in daily activities. That’s why it’s so important to combine walking with some form of strength training; even simple bodyweight exercises or light weights can make a big difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for his verdict on social media fitness trends? They have pros and cons, says Claxton. ‘On the positive side, they can motivate people to try new workouts and become more active, which is always a good thing. However, not everything you see online is safe, effective, or suitable for everyone. Many of these trends are designed more to capture attention than to genuinely improve health. My advice is to use TikTok as inspiration, but rely on proper guidance from a professional for your actual training.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400043b6qie8qty1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, &lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" target="_blank"&gt;former director&lt;/a&gt; of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400053b6qnjvc0mmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400063b6qdhz5qfuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400073b6qjha77pyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400093b6qd10kohyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000a3b6q8qy7zxcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000b3b6q55mraq53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000c3b6qvfe7mawt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000d3b6qlbpdx98z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000e3b6qqsmwmxi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;opposing some public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000f3b6qxdf9bbum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000g3b6q44lkj3gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000i3b6qr8p312tm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000j3b6qlc01sbki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000k3b6qc6xu4tme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000l3b6qnof2g4j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000m3b6qwmaznndw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000n3b6qecdlcmzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000o3b6q31zms2se@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000p3b6qzyso9zk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000q3b6qcrcw9rnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The earlier an infection occurs, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the worse the consequences&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000r3b6qo61wz79e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000s3b6qr2nog8an@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000t3b6qwdapr128@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000v3b6quv9tl5hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000w3b6qtirkxn2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000x3b6qoiwlb5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt;often transmitted&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000y3b6qdbmts876@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000z3b6q5bkqnhzc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400103b6q0vzzraqx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;advise universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400113b6qdw8cnqwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400123b6qg4h7ywa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400133b6qvusz6qpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400143b6q84fbqw19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400153b6qu9qidscv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400173b6q9m59aajv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400183b6qwdt4i9bn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400193b6qzuyrdh9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001a3b6qxp226pnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001b3b6qrukma1rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001c3b6qbyzbp0pf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001d3b6qwyy4hrkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

Consistent high blood pressure damages the arteries, leading to serious complications like a heart attack and stroke. Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Blood pressure that is consistently at or above 130/80 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure. According to the World Health Organization (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), about 1.28 billion adults (30–79 ) have hypertension globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this condition especially dangerous is that it is a ‘silent killer’, which means you won’t realize that you may have it until it gets diagnosed. About 46% of adults with hypertension are unaware that they have the condition. This is why regular check-ups are crucial. Catching it early is crucial for preventing the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="em" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;See More: High BP?

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newborn circumcision rates in the US fell from 54% in 2012 to 49% in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;White families saw the sharpest drop, while Black and Hispanic rates stayed steady.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wealthier and privately insured families had higher rates but also bigger declines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers point to rising skepticism toward medicine and Hispanic population growth as possible factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE —&lt;/strong&gt; Circumcision among newborn boys in the United States has steadily declined over the past decade, even as leading health organizations have voiced support for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University of more than 1.5 million annual hospital records shows the share of newborn boys circumcised during their first month of life fell from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This decline came after the World Health Organization (2007), the American Academy of Pediatrics (2012), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018) each issued &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-circumcision-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommendations supporting access&lt;/a&gt; to newborn circumcision. These groups highlighted research linking the procedure with lower risks of urinary tract infections, penile inflammation, and transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-white-families-account-for-the-largest-circumcision-decline"&gt;White Families Account for the Largest Circumcision Decline&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trends varied sharply across racial and ethnic groups. For White newborns, circumcision prevalence was 61.0% in 2012, rose to a peak of 65.3% in 2019, and then declined to 60.0% in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Black families maintained the highest rates at about 66% throughout the study period, while Hispanic families consistently had the lowest at around 21%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regional differences were just as pronounced. Hospitals in the Midwest recorded the highest prevalence at 68.5% in 2022, while Western hospitals reported only 19.7%. Among White families in the West, circumcision dropped from 34.3% in 2012 to 26.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wealth-and-insurance-status-shape-decisions"&gt;Wealth and Insurance Status Shape Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Household income&lt;/a&gt; and insurance coverage also influenced circumcision choices. Parents in the wealthiest zip codes started with higher rates (59.4% in 2012) but saw some of the steepest declines, falling to 51.1% by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insurance patterns told a similar story. Families with private coverage had the highest baseline prevalence, 64.2% in 2012, yet their rate fell sharply to 56.3% in 2022. Medicaid-covered families showed smaller shifts, with circumcision declining from 44.5% to 42.3% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policy changes may have contributed. By 2011, 17 states had ended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicaid coverage&lt;/a&gt; for routine newborn circumcision, creating financial hurdles for some families. Still, researchers noted that cost alone cannot explain the overall decline, since reductions were also seen among privately insured families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-factors-and-changing-attitudes-towards-circumcision"&gt;Cultural Factors and Changing Attitudes Towards Circumcision&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors note that several factors may contribute to why parents are choosing circumcision less often despite medical endorsements. The American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that the health benefits outweigh the risks but stresses that the decision should remain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with parents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They highlight increased skepticism toward medical recommendations in the United States and the continual growth of the Hispanic population and births, given that Hispanic families have consistently low circumcision rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.2464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that rates among Black newborns stayed stable across regions, while White newborns showed the largest decreases. The authors did not investigate reasons for these racial differences, only documenting their persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medical-guidance-meets-parental-autonomy"&gt;Medical Guidance Meets Parental Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a nationally representative sample of pediatric hospitalizations. They examined circumcision procedures performed within 28 days of birth, identified through billing codes. This design captures most newborn circumcisions, though not those performed in outpatient clinics or later in infancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limitations include possible underreporting due to coding sensitivity, lack of state-level identifiers, and the fact that the database counts hospital discharges rather than unique infants. Still, the study represents the most comprehensive national picture available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2022, medical organizations offered some of their clearest endorsements of circumcision’s health benefits. Yet parents moved in the opposite direction, choosing the procedure less often. The gap between institutional recommendations and family decisions underscores how health behaviors reflect more than clinical guidance alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors concluded, circumcision trends reflect a mix of demographic change, cultural views, and shifting trust in healthcare—factors that shape decisions even when medical benefits are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article is for general information only and should not be taken as medical advice. Parents should consult healthcare professionals when making decisions about circumcision or other procedures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database from 2012 to 2022, examining over 1.5 million hospital records of male newborns aged 0-28 days each year. They excluded babies with bleeding disorders, penile abnormalities, or premature births. The team used medical billing codes to identify circumcision procedures and applied statistical weights to generate national estimates. They calculated annual circumcision rates and used regression analysis to measure changes over time across different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall circumcision rates declined from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022. White families drove most of the decline, with rates dropping from 65.3% to 60%. Black families maintained stable rates around 66%, while Hispanic families remained at about 21%. The Midwest had the highest rates (68.5%) and the West the lowest (19.7%). Wealthier families and those with private insurance had higher circumcision rates but experienced the largest declines during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only captured hospital-based circumcisions using billing codes, which may underestimate total circumcision rates due to coding issues or outpatient procedures. The database tracks hospital discharges rather than individual patients, so multiple hospitalizations for the same baby appear as separate records. State-level data wasn’t available, limiting analysis of policy effects. The study was restricted to the first 28 days of life, potentially missing some procedures performed later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study received partial funding from a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases grant (R01DK131926).

To paraphrase Hume: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one is causing the other. Every smart person already already knows this, and it's repeated constantly, but we all still get it wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2025/07/31/correlation-dressed-up-as-causation-the-reality-of-microbiome-science/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;20 years of research on "gut biomes"&lt;/a&gt; could be wrong, partly as a result of both scientists and the media mistaking correlation and causation. (I've always had a gut feeling—get it?—this research was suspect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years people believed that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health. But it isn't. It's &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9653126/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;better health in some populations&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of mistaken beliefs derived from the correlation/causation fallacy will often compile volumes of data that shows a nearly exact correlations between, say, higher rates of autism and higher rates of vaccination, which makes it totally understandable to believe one causes the other. But there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;no evidence that vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, and the correlation is probably because children received vaccines around the age autism is generally diagnosed, and we've gotten better at both vaccinating children and diagnosing autism. But "probably" is doing some lifting in that sentence. While no causal link between vaccines and autism has ever been demonstrated, there could be any number of reasons the rates line up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic debunking examples of correlation and causation, like the link between &lt;a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2025/06/17/glp-spaces-on-x-ice-cream-sales-increase-drowning-confusing-correlation-and-causation-yields-strange-and-often-harmful-results" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;ice cream sales and shark attacks&lt;/a&gt;, tend to offer a pat explanation for the causal link—it only seems like ice cream causes shark attacks because both ice cream sales and swimming in the ocean rise when the weather is warmer—but even that is potentially mistaking correlation for causation. It makes sense, but we don’t actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; why those two numbers line up. And sometimes there just isn't any reason for connection between two pieces of disparate information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the chart below. It's &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; that the ratings of &lt;em&gt;Two and Half Men&lt;/em&gt; directly correlates with the amount of jet fuel used in Serbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="eloquent-imagery-image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the second example on Tyler Vigen's &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Spurious Correlations&lt;/a&gt;, with a tool that will lets you &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious/discover" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;make random connections all day.&lt;/a&gt; Not only that, the site uses AI to generate &lt;a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious/research-papers/2700_fueling-laughter-exploring-the-comedic-connection-between-two-and-a-half-men-season-ratings-and-jet-fuel-consumption-in-serbia.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;bogus "research papers&lt;/a&gt;" to explain the connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the cats, ChatGPT offers this as a possible explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health-conscious households (those that track diet, buy fruit, etc.) are more likely to treat even minor injuries cautiously. A person who eats more fruit is not more likely to be scratched, but they are more likely to Google 'my cat scratched me' to check for infection risks or treatment steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I know it's bullshit, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt;. That's why we can never really stop being wrong in this specific way. Our brains &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe. A neatly phrased explanation, a tidy chart, a plausible-sounding theory—it's so &lt;em&gt;satisfying&lt;/em&gt;.  A simple "we don't know" can't hold a candle to that certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistaking correlation for causation makes us go on fad diets and believe we're being healthy by drinking wine at dinner. It shapes health advice, public policy, and personal decisions in ways that can actually hurt people. The best we can do is try to be aware of it—when we read a headline that says "X causes Y," to assume this is a "cat scratches cause fruit consumption" situation until there's evidence that it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cats may have a reputation for independence, but emerging research suggests we share a unique connection with them – fueled by brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main chemical involved is oxytocin, often called the love hormone. It's the same neurochemical that surges when a mother cradles her baby or when friends hug, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;fostering trust and affection&lt;/a&gt;. And now studies are showing oxytocin is important for cat-human bonding too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin plays a central role in social bonding, trust and stress regulation in many animals, including humans. One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;2005 experiment&lt;/a&gt; showed that oxytocin made human volunteers significantly more willing to trust others in financial games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-a-simple-technique-to-communicate-with-your-cat"&gt;Scientists Reveal a Simple Technique to Communicate With Your Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg" alt="Scans Reveal Owning a Cat Changes Your Brain (And Theirs)" class="wp-image-174376 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace-600x379.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Snuggling with a cat can help suppress the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(Tatiana Lavrova/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin also has calming effects in humans and animals, as it suppresses the stress hormone cortisol and activates the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/our-vagus-nerves-help-us-rest-digest-and-restore-can-you-really-reset-them-to-feel-better-210469"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; (the rest and digest system) to help the body &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Two%20stress%20response%20pathways%20to,and%20these%20effects"&gt;relax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that friendly interactions &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;trigger oxytocin release&lt;/a&gt; in both dogs and their owners, creating a mutual &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-dog-can-read-your-mind-sort-of-261720"&gt;feedback loop of bonding&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, though, not much was known about its effect in cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats are more subtle in showing affection. Yet their owners often report the same warm feelings of companionship and stress relief that dog owners do – and studies are increasingly backing these reports up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Daily%20direct%20interaction%20with%20cats,physiological%20stress%20in%20their%20owners"&gt;reported in 2021&lt;/a&gt; that brief petting sessions with their cats boosted oxytocin levels in many owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that study, women interacted with their cats for a few minutes while scientists measured the owners' hormone levels. The results suggested that friendly contact (stroking the cat, talking in a gentle tone) was linked to elevated oxytocin in the humans' saliva, compared with a quiet resting period without their cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find petting a purring cat is soothing, and research indicates it's not just because of the soft fur. The act of petting and even the sound of purring can trigger oxytocin release in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa6be7de17ba3f559d28f25/t/5aa85bc7e2c4839970ff3190/1520982983501/pet_paper.pdf"&gt;One 2002 study&lt;/a&gt; found this oxytocin rush from gentle cat contact helps lower cortisol (our stress hormone), which in turn can reduce blood pressure and even pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147487" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg" alt="Green cat eyes peaking over fluffy object" class="wp-image-147487 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-tabby-cat-lying-on-white-textile-L9_6aQAUu-4"&gt;axholmephotography/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When is oxytocin released between cats and humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is pinpointing specific moments that cause the release of this hormone in our cross-species friendship. Gentle physical contact seems to be a prime trigger for cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016815912500022X"&gt;A February 2025 study &lt;/a&gt; found that when owners engaged in relaxed petting, cuddling or cradling of their cats, the owners' oxytocin tended to rise, and so did the cats' – if the interaction was not forced on the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored oxytocin in cats during 15 minutes of play and cuddling at home with their owner. Securely attached cats who initiated contact such as lap-sitting or nudging showed an oxytocin surge. The more time they spent close to their humans, the greater the boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about less-cuddly felines? The same study noted different patterns in cats with more anxious or aloof attachment styles. Avoidant cats (those who kept their distance) showed no significant oxytocin change, while cats who were anxious (constantly seeking their owner but easily overwhelmed by handling) had high oxytocin to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin of avoidant and anxious cats was found to drop after a forced cuddle. When interactions respect the cat's comfort, the oxytocin flows – but when a cat feels cornered, the bonding hormone is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe humans could learn something from their feline friends on managing attachment styles. The key to bonding with a cat is understanding how they communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats don't rely on prolonged eye contact to bond. Instead, they use more understated signals. The most well known is the slow blink. It's a feline smile, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73426-0"&gt;signaling safety&lt;/a&gt; and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purring also plays a role in bonding with people. The low-frequency rumble of a cat's purr has been linked not only to healing in cats themselves, but also to &lt;a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/hai.2021.0006"&gt;calming effects in humans&lt;/a&gt;. Listening to purring can lower heart rate and blood pressure; oxytocin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340037/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;mediates these benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companionship of a cat, reinforced by all those &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Kamimura%2C%20I,Green"&gt;little oxytocin boosts&lt;/a&gt; from daily interactions, can serve as a buffer against anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279393787002385"&gt;in some cases&lt;/a&gt; providing comfort on par with human social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_115183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg" alt="Black cat crouching to pounce on toy" class="wp-image-115183 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Like dogs, many catch will play fetch. (scaliger/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are cats just less loving than dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's true that studies generally find stronger oxytocin responses in dog–human interactions. In &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/research-dogs-actually-love-their-owners-more-than-cats-do/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;one widely discussed 2016 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, scientists measured oxytocin in pets and owners before and after ten minutes of play. Dogs showed an average 57 percent spike in oxytocin levels after playtime, whereas cats showed about a 12 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, oxytocin levels rise during meaningful social interactions. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00532/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that contact with a loved one produces stronger oxytocin responses than contact with strangers. So, a happy dog greeting is akin to that rush of seeing your child or partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs, being pack animals domesticated for constant human companionship, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00602-3"&gt;are almost hard-wired&lt;/a&gt; to seek eye contact, petting, and approval from us – behavior that stimulates oxytocin release in both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats, however, evolved from more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159124000169"&gt;solitary hunters&lt;/a&gt; which didn't need overt social gestures to survive. So, they may not display oxytocin-fueled behavior as readily or consistently. Instead, cats may reserve their oxytocin-releasing behavior for when they truly feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat's trust isn't automatic; it must be earned. But once given, it is reinforced by the same chemical that bonds human parents, partners, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time your cat blinks slowly from across the sofa or climbs on to your lap for a purr-filled cuddle, know that something invisible is happening too: oxytocin is rising in both your brains, deepening the trust and soothing the stress of daily life. Cats, in their own way, have tapped into the ancient biology of love.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264396/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;There's a particular quality some older people have—a spark that makes you forget you're talking to someone who remembers when television was new. They drop perfectly timed jokes, recall obscure facts with startling clarity, and somehow manage to stay current without trying too hard. These aren't just the genetically blessed. They're people who've figured out that staying mentally sharp isn't about sudoku puzzles and crosswords alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between those who remain vibrant conversationalists at 75 and those who retreat into repetitive stories isn't luck. It's a collection of habits, attitudes, and deliberate choices that keep their minds flexible while their joints might not be. These rules aren't complicated or expensive—they're accessible to anyone willing to rethink what aging means for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat curiosity like oxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest septuagenarians approach new information like they're still 25 and figuring out the world. They ask follow-up questions about your job, genuinely want to understand cryptocurrency, and aren't afraid to admit when something confuses them. This isn't politeness—it's intellectual survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity prevents the mind from calcifying around old assumptions. When you stop asking "why" and "how," your brain stops building new neural pathways. The mentally agile elderly understand that learning isn't just for the young—it's what keeps you young. They read books outside their comfort zone, watch documentaries about subjects they know nothing about, and aren't embarrassed to be beginners at something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They collect experiences, not just memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a difference between having stories and having the same story. Sharp older adults keep adding chapters to their lives instead of just rereading the old ones. They try the new restaurant, take the unfamiliar route, say yes to invitations that younger them might have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about bungee jumping at 80. It's about maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1232670/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking to new situations. Every new experience forces the brain to create fresh connections. The mentally vibrant understand that routine might be comfortable, but variation is what keeps neurons firing. They know that the phrase "I've never tried that before" should never fully leave your vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They embrace technology without surrendering to it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wittiest older adults have smartphones and know how to use them, but they're not enslaved by them. They've learned enough technology to stay connected and informed without letting it overwhelm their identity or dominate their time. They text their grandkids, share memes that actually land, and can navigate streaming services without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the key: they use technology as a tool, not a crutch. They understand that digital engagement opens doors to information and connection, but they don't mistake online interaction for real relationships. They've found the sweet spot between being a Luddite and being lost in the digital world. Their social media posts are coherent, but they also don't live for likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They maintain friendships across generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart 70-somethings don't just hang out with other 70-somethings. They cultivate friendships across age groups, not as mentors or authority figures, but as genuine peers. They have coffee with 40-year-olds, debate politics with 30-year-olds, and aren't threatened by 20-year-olds who know things they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross-generational mixing prevents the echo chamber effect that can make older adults feel disconnected from contemporary life. Younger friends bring fresh perspectives, new vocabulary, and different problems to solve. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163721001471" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intergenerational connections&lt;/a&gt; can improve cognitive function and social well-being. The mentally sharp elderly understand these friendships aren't about feeling young—they're about staying relevant and engaged with the world as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They laugh at themselves first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest wit often belongs to those who've learned not to take themselves too seriously. They'll joke about their "senior moments," their technological struggles, their creaking joints—but never in a self-pitying way. They've weaponized self-deprecation as a form of connection, not defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This humor serves a deeper purpose than just getting laughs. Self-directed humor is actually a sophisticated cognitive function that requires perspective-taking and emotional regulation. When you can laugh at your own limitations, you're demonstrating mental flexibility and resilience. The sharpest seniors know that taking yourself too seriously is the fastest way to become a caricature of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They read like their brain depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just newspapers or their favorite genre—they read widely, voraciously, and challengingly. Fiction, non-fiction, long-form journalism, even the occasional graphic novel. They treat reading not as a pastime but as cognitive maintenance, each book a different exercise for different mental muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is variety. Reading only political books that confirm your views is like only doing bicep curls at the gym. The mentally sharp mix it up: a mystery novel followed by a history of jazz, a memoir paired with science writing. They understand that every new author's voice, every unfamiliar subject, forces the brain to work harder, stay more agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They pick their battles and forget the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp seniors have learned what's worth arguing about and what isn't. They'll engage in spirited debates about things that matter but won't waste energy correcting every wrong opinion or fighting every slight. They've developed what might be called selective passion—intense when it counts, relaxed when it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't apathy; it's wisdom. It requires the prefrontal cortex to override the emotional brain's need to be right all the time. Those who stay sharp understand that mental energy is finite, and spending it on petty grievances leaves less for creativity, humor, and genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They stay physically active without being obsessive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest minds past 70 usually inhabit bodies that move regularly. Not marathon-running necessarily, but walking, swimming, gardening—something that gets blood flowing to the brain. They understand the brain-body connection isn't just wellness-speak; it's biological fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they're not fanatics. They don't bore you with their step count or lecture about their workout routine. They've found sustainable ways to stay active that feel more like living than exercising. Movement is integrated into life, not segregated into gym time. Research consistently shows that even moderate exercise can significantly improve cognitive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They create more than they consume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's writing letters, cooking new recipes, woodworking, or watercolors, mentally sharp seniors are makers, not just takers. They produce something—anything—that didn't exist before they created it. This isn't about talent or skill; it's about the act of creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating requires the brain to work in ways that consuming never will. It demands problem-solving, planning, and adaptation when things don't go as expected. The act of creation, regardless of the medium, builds cognitive reserve—the brain's ability to maintain function despite age-related changes. Those who stay sharp understand that the question isn't "Am I good at this?" but "Am I engaged by this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who remain quick-witted and mentally agile past 70 haven't discovered a secret formula or won a genetic lottery. They've simply refused to accept the narrative that aging means inevitable intellectual decline. They've chosen engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, growth over stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules aren't really rules at all—they're invitations to remain fully alive regardless of age. They recognize that the brain, like any muscle, responds to how you use it. The sharp seniors among us have figured out that wit isn't about being young; it's about being interested. They know that mental agility isn't about denying age; it's about embracing complexity at any age. Most importantly, they understand that staying sharp isn't just about cognitive exercise—it's about maintaining a fundamental belief that there's always something new to learn, someone interesting to meet, and something worth laughing about. Even—especially—yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an old Babylonian/Biblical legal maxim that goes, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Canadian Brent Chapman, his new maxim is “a tooth for an eye,” because he has become the first in his country ever to receive an osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Latin is on point, you’ll realize that translates to a tooth-in-eye prosthetic—literally Chapman’s tooth has been surgically implanted into his eye to act as a lens fixture which has enabled him to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort, and after 50 surgical transplants and procedures, that’s where Chapman was alongside his dedicated ophthalmological surgeon Dr. Greg Moloney, who has been putting Chapman under the knife since he was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 34, Brent suffered a rare reaction to ibuprofen at age 13 that left severe burns on his cornea. The cornea acts like a windscreen, keeping debris and liquids out of the eyeball while allowing light to penetrate and reach the retina and optic nerve, but the burns permanently obscured the vision in his right eye while his left was lost entirely to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tooth-in-eye surgery is rare; very rare—so rare that despite being pioneered in the 1960s Chapman’s procedure is the very first ever done in Canada. According to Dr. Moloney, it’s turned to when all other options have already been tried and failed, or the initial damage to the cornea is so substantial that ophthalmologists know there’s no chance conventional replacements or grafts will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooth is chosen because it’s made of the hardest material produced by the body. A hole is drilled through the canine tooth and a hi-tech lens is fitted inside. The tooth is then attached to the cheek through the eye, and an aperture to the retina and optic nerve is created so that the light can enter the lens and reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With glasses Chapman has about 20/30 vision, meaning at 20 feet he can see clearly what someone with perfect vision can see at 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moloney &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/tooth-in-eye-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spoke with CNN&lt;/a&gt; about the procedure, the bizarre sense in it, and the effect it has on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place. It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own,” said the corneal surgeon from the University of British Columbia. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world, it’s very emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapman agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting,” said the professional massage therapist, looking out at Vancouver from Moloney’s office on the 16th floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult. Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s excited to see the faces of his beloved niece and nephew, 4 and 2, and also to return to a normal work schedule. He enjoys massage work because it means that he can help others who have pain, and give back, in a sense, for all the treatment he’s received over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can’t wait to “not make everything about me,” go to Japan, and not have to worry about plans falling through or piling various medications and emergency contacts into his luggage and phone in case his vision fails again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Be kind to yourself” is a piece of advice that’s often given to people during difficult times or moments of stress. But for someone who is driven, a perfectionist or facing pressure, the idea of self-compassion can feel uncomfortable. To them, kindness might feel like letting themselves off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But research actually shows that consistently feeling shame and self-judgment can activate the body’s stress response just as strongly as physical danger. This increases &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00295.x?casa_token=jnaNlof97YMAAAAA%3AIBaA_QcX7cl8Tjc8TlExbFsg-iBCYayZYIqehdTxS-wuCsIYtEo2hIqgKY0Pn33ouALV4A0Hcp35mrTd"&gt;cortisol and inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are linked to long-term health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, research suggests that being kind to yourself – known in psychology as “self-compassion” – can actually support motivation, accountability and resilience without the cost of burnout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35961039/"&gt;Self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; can be defined as the ability to view yourself with kindness and a mindful or balanced perspective on what’s happening to you – as opposed to viewing yourself with judgment, focusing on your mistakes or feeling like you’re alone in your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Germer2019.pdf"&gt;key components&lt;/a&gt; of self-compassion include mindful awareness (noticing your pain or struggle without denial or exaggeration), self-kindness (offering support rather than criticism) and shared humanity (remembering that everyone struggles sometimes and that imperfection is part of being human).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion doesn’t mean letting yourself off the hook. It means staying connected to yourself in a way that supports real, healthy change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But practising self-compassion is often easier said than done. If you’re someone who finds it difficult to be kind to yourself, here are three ways having more self-compassion can be beneficial for you – and how to increase self-compassion in your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Reduces your body’s stress response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress is a natural part of life that our bodies are well-adapted to cope with. It allows us to perform daily tasks and be more engaged. However, consistent exposure to stress without relief may result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01224-9"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to both mental and physical health problems including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4155/fso.15.21"&gt;cardiovascular disorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00021-1"&gt;decreased immunity&lt;/a&gt; and mental health challenges such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn2297"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce exposure to chronic stress, we need to be able to engage our brain’s parasympathetic system – the part of the nervous system that helps the body relax and also controls functions such as digestion and breathing. The parasympathetic system is often stimulated by relaxation and feelings of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2017.07.077"&gt;safety, security and comfort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion may be a powerful tool in helping create the feeling of security and comfort &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809837-0.00004-0"&gt;within ourselves&lt;/a&gt; that’s needed to stimulate this internal system. Research suggests self-compassionate thoughts can result in physiological changes such as improved &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-018-0900-9"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt; – a marker of emotional regulation and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Helps you respond and adapt to feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people fear that too much self-compassion could mean they become self-centred or avoid responsibility. But when we practise self-compassion, we often become more available to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We model healthier &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-020-01563-8"&gt;coping strategies&lt;/a&gt;, respond &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2023.101237"&gt;better to feedback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.06.029"&gt;recover faster from setbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this happens is because self-compassion teaches us to respond to ourselves with the same care we would offer others. Instead of saying: “I’m not good enough,” a self-compassionate person might say: “This was hard, what can I learn for next time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Self-compassion can make us more empathetic towards others.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-hispanic-woman-office-hugging-oneself-2311197309"&gt;Krakenimages.com/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, as we begin to show empathy towards our own imperfections and mistakes, we are better able to extend that empathy &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2013.831465"&gt;towards others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Makes you more likely to succeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common fear is that self-compassion will make us &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it"&gt;lazy or unambitious&lt;/a&gt;. But studies show the opposite to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who practise self-compassion are more likely to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2013.831465"&gt;take responsibility for their actions&lt;/a&gt;, try again after failure and stay engaged with long-term goals. They procrastinate less and take more conscientious, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15298868.2022.2104363"&gt;less impulsive decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, shame and negative self-esteem may drive short-term performance, but we’re &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37285-9_5"&gt;less likely to maintain&lt;/a&gt; this motivation over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to practise self-compassion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to give self-compassion a go, the next time you catch yourself in a loop of harsh self-talk, pause and ask: if someone I loved were in this situation, what would I say to them? Then try offering yourself the same words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And use neutral, non-judgmental language. Instead of “I shouldn’t feel this way” or “I’ve failed again,” try to make your thinking less personal. You could tell yourself instead: “This is hard” or “I’m not the only one who feels this way.” You could even try to be more forward thinking, asking yourself: “This is my situation right now, what can I do next?” These small shifts reduce emotional reactivity and help support clearer thinking under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, look at the bigger picture. It’s easy to feel alone in our struggles. But everyone, regardless of culture, background or personality, experiences doubt, regret or imperfection. Remind yourself that no one is perfect and everyone has hard days. You’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practices such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.07.003"&gt;loving-kindness meditation&lt;/a&gt; can also help with developing self-compassion. During this form of meditation, the focus is on sending good wishes or kind thoughts to yourself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re navigating illness, chronic stress or the pressures of daily life, being kind to yourself isn’t indulgence – it’s a skill that protects your health, your mind and your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flu shots are now available at many pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and clinics around the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccine is the most effective way to protect against severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the changes to COVID vaccine eligibility this year, the CDC and professional medical organizations still recommend everyone get the vaccine this fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Federal health agencies are expected to make substantial changes to vaccine guidance this fall. However, the flu vaccine recommendation remains the same: &lt;strong&gt;everyone older than 6 months should get an annual flu shot.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As many as 1.3 million Americans were hospitalized with the flu in the last flu season, and up to 130,000 people died from the disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The flu shot is both safe and life-saving&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.southnassau.org/sn/find-a-doctor/glatt-aaron-e-md-macp-fidsa-fshea-chair-department-26" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aaron Glatt, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/who-should-not-get-flu-shots-770429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no differences in who can get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it for all people ages 6 months or older, with rare exceptions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The agency’s advisory panel is scheduled to meet in late September to discuss routine vaccines against COVID and other diseases, but not the flu vaccine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The vaccines are available now in many pharmacies, clinics, and doctors’ offices across the country. Flu cases typically pick up in October and peak in February, though that varies by year and region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glatt said it’s wise to get your flu shot sooner rather than later to ensure you’re protected when flu rears its head in your community. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“You should have very good immunity in September that will last you through the flu season. Waiting until October isn't necessarily a dangerous thing if there's no flu around, but you probably want to have immunity when flu comes to your region,” Glatt said.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the COVID vaccines debuted in 2021, the CDC and medical groups have said that &lt;strong&gt;people can safely get the COVID and flu shots at the same time without diminishing their effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a late August &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/188486/download" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA’s top vaccine official said he “cannot affirm” that co-administering the vaccines is safe and effective and that the agency would start requiring vaccine makers to run clinical trials before making that claim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.taskforce.org/employees/joe-bresee/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joseph Bresee, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of respiratory virus prevention and preparedness at The Task Force for Global Health, said that there is sound evidence that the practice is safe and people should feel comfortable getting their COVID and flu shots in the same visit while the FDA collects more data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “More importantly, the ability to get vaccines together during the same visit creates an opportunity to expand the reach of these vaccines,” Bresee told Verywell. “If you make folks come back for one vaccine and then another vaccine in two weeks, you may lose some folks and miss the opportunity to get them vaccinated.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you have health insurance, the flu vaccine should be free to you.&lt;/strong&gt; Insurers are required to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC’s advisory panel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are uninsured, the cost for a shot at a pharmacy could be as low as $20 or over $100. Many cities offer low- or no-cost vaccines to people without insurance at public health clinics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can now order the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-the-nasal-flu-vaccine-flumist-770756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FluMist nasal spray vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to your home.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This allows caretakers to give the vaccine or for people to self-administer without visiting a pharmacy or doctor’s office.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The nasal spray is safe and effective for people ages 2 to 49 years old who are not pregnant or immunocompromised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a nice option for people who have trouble getting to the doctor or the clinic, who are homebound for whatever reason,” Bresee said. “Many of those people are at higher risk for severe disease because they have underlying illnesses, and that's the reason they can't leave the house as easily.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-effective-is-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Effective Is the Flu Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We won’t know exactly how effective this year’s flu vaccine is until around February.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-5211793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine formula changes every year&lt;/a&gt; based on predictions from global health experts about which viral strains will circulate in the upcoming season. &lt;strong&gt;When the strains are well matched, the vaccine is usually between 40% and 60% effective at preventing severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's important to realize that getting the flu vaccine doesn't mean that you won't get the flu,” Glatt said. “Get vaccinated: if you do get the flu, you'll probably have a much milder episode. It certainly has been shown that it prevents hospitalizations, it prevents serious illness, and it prevents death.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The FDA recently expanded eligibility for the Flublok vaccine, a recombinant flu vaccine, to people as young as 9 years old.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flublok uses a different technology than standard flu vaccines, which has been shown to be more effective in older adults. The CDC says all the options available for people younger than 65 are similarly effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-flu-vaccine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Are the Side Effects of the Flu Vaccine? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Flu vaccines are very, very safe vaccines. They've been given hundreds of millions of times over decades, and &lt;strong&gt;the most common side effects are locally sore arms or a little redness around for about 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;,” Bresee said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, they're very safe, and we shouldn't expect any new side effects popping up this year.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who has had significant allergic reactions to the flu or other vaccines in the past should talk to a health care provider before getting the shot. Otherwise, the vaccine is safe for just about everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your doctor is your best source of information. He knows you. He knows your history,” Glatt said. “The CDC, professional society websites, and the Department of Health remain, at this point in time, excellent resources for information.”

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against severe illness from influenza. To stay healthy and avoid getting others sick, make it a habit to wash your hands, cover your cough, stay home when you’re sick, and wear a mask if you’re contagious or worried about exposure. If you have flu, your doctor can prescribe you Tamiflu to help manage the symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As a GP myself, I knew how serious my condition was,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/burnout-relief-techniquest-longevity-alka-patel-rl5r2vrkg"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; of her 2011 health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With three children and a successful but often stressful career, Dr Patel admitted that she never slowed down enough to notice the red-flag warning signs that she was about to crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital by her husband—Mandish, a dentist—after her temperature continued to climb past 38C, where she underwent emergency abdominal surgery, as doctors suspected an abscess in her abdomen could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they found nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being discharged following a month-long recovery stint in hospital, Dr Patel knew something needed to change, as it dawned on her that her resilience to stress after years of pushing the brink of burnout was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 14 years later, aged 53, Dr Patel has turned back the clock and has an impressive biological age—the age of her cells—of a 20-year-old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alka Patel was hospitalised as her organs began to shut down before she hit reset—tracking everything from her blood sugar, sleep and heart rate to turn back her biological clock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strange as it sounds, science shows we can bring our age down in measurable ways,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm proof of this. And while biohacking might bring to mind wealthy tech titans trying to live forever, many of the techniques I now tech clients as a longevity doctor are free, take minutes and can add decades to our lives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Your biological age is not an ego-fuelled number—it's your health forecast. By dropping your biological age, we can liver longer, with less pain, more energy and agility and with fewer prescriptions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here the Daily Mail breaks down her daily routine, in which she prioritises sleep, diet and exercise for a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The power of a good routine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite advising her patients to get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep a night, Dr Patel rarely got more than four hours a night, working long after her children had gone to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, she has devised a night time routine that slows down ageing by allowing the body to repair cells, replenish depleted energy levels and clear toxic brain matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every night she sets an alarm for 9.30pm which signals her screen curfew, before she gets into bed an hour later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel discovered that her stress levels, which contribute to inflammation when raised, were not dropping low enough at night to allow for deep restorative sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have long urged people to ditch screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a hormone produced naturally in the body that plays a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, throwing off your natural wind-down process. But, experts have also warned that forcing yourself to go to bed with nothing to occupy your mind, can also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15054385/sleep-therapist-five-hacks-insomnia-WORSE.html"&gt; impact your sleep and fuel insomnia. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This hour in between switching off the TV and putting her phone on do not disturb creates the perfect wind-down window, promoting the production of melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Book in hand, Dr Patel gets into bed calm and ready for a restorative 8 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Morning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patel starts her morning with five stretches she holds for 50 seconds—including one that works on balance, such as calf raises—whilst brushing her teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A  study of 1,7000 people aged 50-75 found people who couldn't stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds had an 84 per cent increased risk of death after seven years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This forms a central part of Dr Patel's biohacking, in which she ranks her most-used hacks from 1-10, with a correlating activity or time, to make them easier to implement—showing that no matter how busy you are, you can always find 60 seconds to turn back the clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel recommends habit stacking to implement her most-used biohacks into her routine. For example, whilst cleaning her teeth she will perform calf-raises to improve her balance (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the morning, she also practices her 1-10 hack which involves spending one minute in natural sunlight, followed by 10 seconds setting an intention for the day—with purpose being one of the key pillars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15014419/Blue-Zone-UK-live-100-plymouth.html"&gt;blue zone centenarians. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when she takes her first three sips of water, which she does every 30 minutes for the rest of the day—with one study finding those with lower fluid intake have a 21 per cent higher risk of dying early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 10am, Dr Patel has her first meal, restricting her eating to an eight-hour window to encourage autophagy—the medical term for cell repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Midday &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After filling up on protein and fibre for lunch, Dr Patel goes for a walk or run followed by a quick dumbbell session, which she keeps under her desk at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps redirect blood glucose to the muscles, slashing the risk of diabetes by keeping blood sugar levels under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also makes sure to switch up her posture, alternating between sitting and standing at her desk every 90 minutes to boost circulation and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel keeps dumbbells under her standing desk at work which she uses every day after lunch to help keep blood sugar spikes under control &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when Dr Patel practices gratitude and reflects on her day, to lower stress and improve cognitive function—implementing seven seconds of silence every 70 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paying compliments, meanwhile, is important because it releases the bonding hormone oxytocin,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxytocin has been shown to affect the same centre of the brain as physical pain and may play a role in reducing inflammation and feelings of loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is followed by an early dinner, giving the body enough time to finish digesting and before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too close to bed has long been linked to digestive issues, poor sleep and higher glucose spikes—all of which accelerate the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:47:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQS2NzMEhJT3JHRndMQVlVUEEtUHp1ODczd19BTFlEYzY4ZlRVai1fZzVjX2UtNlBQb1ZDVzNac0IxRnhHR2xvb05SZ0JmX1lWekhFbFprR2xlWEMtX1NaRS1SUEpueWNXWDUwUDUxQzEwZGNlUnZKTlVqWFlpVGgzanhqSzJYam5WRklKbnZzTmjSAZYBQVVfeXFMUFNPbFI2MmgyNVlLSGxMdkxKdzJaNzNvcHhyNEVWUWRmcTAxZWxoR3RucUJZQW1HbmR5S1Y0dmUtU214NlNJMWpKcU5GZGd1UjQ5a2JPWkk4S1lFS2s4XzFoREJJUGZSdElTVmp3blNFMzRmb29ZOHBJSzlwYlJsZFFzZkxyTVBmSFBnOXhwVnlTMGtPaEN3</guid></item><item><title>如果您剃发、剪发或拔发，您的头发会发生什么-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/16/cutting-shaving-plucking-waxing-hair-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMRLLMVJJJBTFL3GN4EBUEU22M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Does cutting or shaving hair make it grow back faster, darker or thicker?

Scientists now suggest that blueberries may deserve a place on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are packed with color-rich compounds, fiber, and vitamins. Adults eat them for heart and brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, though, no one had rigorously tested them in infants. A team at the &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Anschutz&lt;/a&gt; decided to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-one babies between five and twelve months joined. Some received blueberry powder each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others received a powder without blueberries. Parents mixed the powder into normal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unstable-gut-microbes-can-worsen-child-malnutrition/"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing else in the routine had to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-blueberries-and-allergies"&gt;Linking blueberries and allergies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, the blueberry group showed fewer allergy symptoms, especially respiratory ones. Inflammation markers also shifted. IL-13, a molecule tied to asthma and allergies, dropped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-10, known for calming the immune system, nudged upward. These results suggest blueberries encourage balance, not overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For parents beginning to wean their infants, it’s incredibly difficult to find solid, research-backed advice on what &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/key-to-cutting-food-waste-is-in-our-daily-routines/"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; to introduce,” said senior author Minghua Tang, PhD, adjoint associate professor of pediatrics at &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CU Anschutz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is a critical first step in filling that gap by offering real data on how a specific food like blueberries can improve your infant’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-blueberries-protect-babies"&gt;How blueberries protect babies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries owe much of their power to anthocyanins, the pigments that give them a dark blue color. These compounds protect the gut lining, reduce inflammation, and discourage harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also influence immune cells by turning down allergy-driving signals and boosting tolerance-building ones. In plain words, they help the immune system learn when to stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant gut bacteria shifted too. Beneficial groups such as Lactobacillus linked with more IL-10. Less friendly microbes like Citrobacter showed ties to IL-13. These shifts reveal how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/everyday-kitchen-tool-that-could-be-leaching-toxins-into-your-food-polypropylene-cutting-board/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; influences microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern suggests blueberries push gut communities in directions that support calmer immune activity, reducing unnecessary inflammation, encouraging tolerance, and possibly lowering the chance of early allergy development in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blueberries-support-long-term-health"&gt;Blueberries support long-term health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every improvement lined up neatly. Some babies improved without clear biomarker changes, and some biomarker shifts didn’t translate directly into fewer symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch highlights the complexity of the gut–immune connection. Diet seems to nudge the system, but it doesn’t act through one simple pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research supports the idea that blueberries are not only safe for infants but also offer meaningful health benefits,” said Minghua Tang, who is also a researcher at the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute and &lt;a href="https://www.colostate.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just a few blueberries a day could make a difference in supporting long-term health. We view infancy as a critical window of opportunity and what we introduce during this time can have lasting effects as children grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-diet-and-allergy-risks"&gt;Early diet and allergy risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allergic conditions are on the rise worldwide. Eczema, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-tap-water-home-faucet/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; allergies, and asthma often appear in childhood and can persist into adulthood. Scientists increasingly believe that early diet plays a role in either fueling or calming these risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding remains the gold standard, but once solids start, the choice of foods may also matter more than once thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries now join a list of foods being tested for their ability to train the immune system during this vulnerable window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies encourage introducing a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains around six months. Yet parents often hesitate, especially with foods they fear might trigger allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research like this helps reduce uncertainty. It suggests that some foods not only avoid harm but may actively help protect against allergies when offered early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-babies-to-blueberries"&gt;Introducing babies to blueberries &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team stresses this was an early trial. More infants, longer follow-ups, and fresh blueberries instead of powder are next on the agenda. Other foods rich in similar compounds may also help, but those studies still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, families can introduce blueberries safely once babies begin solids. Puree them for the youngest. Mash or slice them for older babies and toddlers to avoid choking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful here and there may help more than just nutrition – it could shape long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/17/2795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:28:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNUVlaaGYzZDQ4d3Z1VVRYZFZOdU9JU3FmdkczZXdadVB0R3pXRGR4X1djWGtIT3NibFdqTzZEV2hqTG5rNE1VaEF0aW9fUWpXc0owOUVQUzV5Q0Rfck1aQUNyUk1KbXpwMlkwNVN5SHBmZTdWckJRX2N2ZnhLUG1teDFOMzlMWU1aUGc</guid></item><item><title>数十亿被黑客入侵的蚊子和疫苗如何击败致命的登革热病毒-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02918-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air.

A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02492-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02492-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;biofactory&lt;/a&gt; that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;-infected mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;growing threat of dengue&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year’s outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks’). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;more than 12,000&lt;/a&gt; — the highest ever recorded for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51447690.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51447690.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="DANGEROUS OUTBREAKS.

A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country’s drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The local approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Qdenga’s roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What’s more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02677-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51380440.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;When will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan’s director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine’s development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a hand holding a vial of mosquito eggs to the light." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Eggs of mosquitoes infected with &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria.

The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine’s long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is already moving through the country’s regulatory process. And although there’s still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil’s regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the vaccine’s approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Butantan’s production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil’s need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Infecting mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Butantan awaits news about the vaccine’s approval, the &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method’s arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-cgb-lede"&gt;&lt;p class="lede-content hide"&gt;The advisory committee makes recommendations to the CDC on what vaccines the American public should take each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday named a Maui children’s physician who used unapproved drugs to treat Covid to serve on a powerful federal advisory panel on vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and pastor at Calvary Chapel South Maui, provided the livestock drug ivermectin and the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat the coronavirus during free house calls for Maui residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and four others named Monday join the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at a fraught moment in public health. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;fired all 17 sitting members of the panel&lt;/a&gt; that makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how vaccines should be used, saying that a clean sweep is necessary to restore public trust in vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the health secretary’s picks have already been contentious, however. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Robert Malone has been a vocal critic of Covid mRNA vaccines, blaming &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;two deaths of unvaccinated children in the Texas measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; on “medical mismanagement” without citing any evidence. He and Milhoan are among several anti-vaccine voices on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hawaiʻi, Milhoan’s embrace of discredited Covid treatments has made him &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/from-masks-to-vaccines-how-churches-have-power-over-public-health/"&gt;a controversial figure&lt;/a&gt;. He did not require masks or social distancing at Calvary Church of South Maui during the height of the pandemic, saying the church’s mission must continue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His use of discredited drugs during the pandemic was &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/doh-statement-on-the-pono-coalition-for-informed-consent/"&gt;widely condemned&lt;/a&gt; by Hawaiʻi officials, including former Gov. David Ige and former Hawaiʻi Health Director Libby Char.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/that-is-not-aloha-dr-lorrin-pang-is-pushing-back-against-his-critics/"&gt;Dr. Lorrin Pang&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s top medical adviser for Maui County, co-founded The Pono Coalition for Informed Consent, a website that called the Covid vaccines experimental and advocated instead for the use of unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiʻi Medical Board filed a complaint against him and Pang in August 2021 that, if substantiated, could have led to the loss of their state medical licenses. The state Regulated Industries Complaints Office dropped the complaint eight months later and took &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/state-drops-complaint-against-top-maui-medical-professional/"&gt;no disciplinary actions&lt;/a&gt; against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, Milhoan participated in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/d41d8cd9/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-leads-a-hearing-on-injuries-caused-by-covid-19-vaccin/6998956623513668/"&gt;a 2024 hearing&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, a Republican from Georgia, on Covid-19 vaccine injuries. During the hearing he &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/discredited-covid-19-vaccine-skeptics-130000894.html"&gt;advocated against vaccinating children&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the Covid vaccine had triggered cardiac problems in some pediatric patients he’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan and his wife operate &lt;a href="https://forheartsandsouls.org/who-we-are/"&gt;For Hearts and Souls&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit Christian medical ministry which provides medical care to children around the world with cardiac problems who lack access to treatment. He is a senior fellow at the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a group formed in March 2020 that advocates for dubious Covid treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has an active medical license in Hawai‘i, Montana, Wyoming and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reached by email Monday, Milhoan, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for his appointment, declined to be interviewed. He cited a request made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that all interviews be coordinated by the agency’s media team. The HHS media team did not respond to phone and email requests for comment or for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revisiting-guidance"&gt;Revisiting Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly configured panel is being convened as public trust in routine vaccines continues to decline nationally. One in six parents reported &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/"&gt;delaying or skipping at least one vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, other than Covid or the flu, for their children in a new KFF-Washington Post survey published Monday of more than 2,700 parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when the panel is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;discuss vaccines against Covid&lt;/a&gt;, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, there are new Covid formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested they wanted to revisit the guidance on Hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. The virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds. Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problems with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other new panel members announced on Monday, bringing the total to 12, are Dr. Catherine Stein, an epidemiologist and professor at Case Western Reserve University; Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana; Dr. Hillary Blackburn, director of medication access and affordability at AscensionRx; and Dr. Raymond Pollak, an organ transplant surgeon with a background in immunology. &lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by a parasite carried by insects called kissing bugs, should now be considered endemic in the United States, experts say – and without recognition that it’s a constant presence in some parts of the country, more people will suffer unnecessarily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60002336nkea8aeh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was published last week in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the authors say they hope that growing global attention on the new paper means Chagas could finally get the surveillance, prevention and testing efforts and research funding it deserves in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60004336nqxxclofm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting forever; all of us Chagas people have been waiting for people to recognize this disease is in our communities,” said Dr. Norman Beatty, coauthor of the report and &lt;a href="https://id.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/beatty-norman/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida College of Medicine’s Division of Infectious Diseases &amp;amp; Global Medicine who has studied Chagas for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60005336n240rslsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers Chagas a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;neglected tropical disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says it is endemic – with a constant presence or usual prevalence – in 21 other countries in the Americas, not including the United States. Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60006336nucdkiiww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflo942g00053b6qyfuto9p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60007336nnwrt5n09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000a336n46075m90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60008336n3bzcz2jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflobcrr000a3b6qldijporx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000b336n9zq95kqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000c336n8tl8gjl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000d336n8wqdxrky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000e336nte0v7otw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsotx0000336nf9fpwfl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflskphj000q3b6qkmgkpfnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfls921l001i336nhzfm5nrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" target="_blank"&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsmh5k000s3b6qdo9se4is@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsoet4000x3b6q7rwyeqhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000f336n1rdp5igo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000g336njp70r42p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000h336ng94jpj19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000i336nrqasd7bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000j336nx5zhim7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.

            “I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”

Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:can also spread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC estimates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:similar motorcycle trip in the US;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9RU0ZWaFFXTjM3MFZJRlR4Vy1BV1dQaWROVE1obHFwQWJGc050TXhOV0wyRHdCUWtBQmNCTTNuelFhZG1yWEF2Ymc5by1lcnR3Y1NnSTJRWFJEdWU1WlluSXVnaDlfWHRZdDhNaE5tTFN2UDVxYTl3</guid></item></channel></rss>
