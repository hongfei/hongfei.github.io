But a need to take them on a regular basis to help with falling and staying asleep could be a signal that the body is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;experiencing cardiac issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b15016" class="body-graf"&gt;“Insomnia can increase blood pressure, stress hormones and inflammation,” said Dr. Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, lead author of the new study and an internal medicine resident at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi and colleagues looked at five years of electronic health records from 130,828 adults, average age 56, finding that people who took melatonin regularly for at least a year were nearly twice as likely to develop heart failure compared to those who didn’t use the supplement, though the actual rates were relatively low: 4.6% of people in the melatonin group developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% among those who didn’t take melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0249d" class="body-graf"&gt;They were more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for the condition (19% versus 6.6%), and nearly twice as likely to die during the study period, compared to people who didn’t take melatonin regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7706af" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether the data captured outcomes of all people in the U.S. who take melatonin long term. Researchers identified people as chronic users of melatonin based on medical records only — that is, if they’d been prescribed the supplement. In the U.S., the supplement is available over the counter and isn’t often reflected in medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f47f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“I caution people against drawing concrete conclusions based on this study alone,” said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved with the study. “But now that we have this observation, this is prime time to figure out whether there’s actually a direct association of harm with sleep agents. That would be practice-changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e813e" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi’s research is scheduled to be presented in New Orleans at an upcoming meeting of the American Heart Association. It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60e9c7" class="body-graf"&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body’s organs for them to function properly. Nearly 7 million Americans have the condition, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/heart-failure.html#" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-097025" class="body-graf"&gt;While the study found that long-term melatonin use was an indicator of potential heart problems — and not causing the problems itself — experts agreed more research is needed into the supplements’ possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8b9da" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have patients using all kinds of supplements without understanding the risks,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, a preventive cardiologist and the incoming director of the Davis Women’s Heart Center at Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute in Texas. “If there is harm from a supplement, it means the cost could be far more than simply expensive urine.” Gulati was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35619" class="body-graf"&gt;Melatonin is a hormone made naturally by the body that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Synthetic versions, sold widely over the counter as dietary supplements, are marketed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/falling-asleep-time-may-safest-heart-new-study-shows-rcna4887" target="_blank"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt; or overcome jet lag. Because supplements aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, doses and purity can vary widely among brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-457ac4" class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the supplement has increased in recent years. A 2022 &lt;a href="http://sleepfoundation.org" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 27% of U.S. adults take melatonin, as well as 4% of kids. The new study &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/reports-melatonin-poisoning-kids-increased-rcna31741" target="_blank"&gt;didn’t include children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c323a7" class="body-graf"&gt;People taking melatonin for sleep for more than a year should talk with their doctor, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d3cf" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,” Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, said in a press release.

According to data from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, around 7 million farmed birds have died from the illness since the start of September. This includes the death of over 1 million turkeys from bird flu, causing supply concerns for the upcoming holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks of bird flu typically flare up in the fall due to the seasonal migration of wild birds. This migration brings different bird populations together, increasing the virus' spread into new areas and into domestic flocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is an outbreak of bird flu this fall important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the most popular bird to cook for Thanksgiving, turkeys are generally in very high demand throughout the month of November. The outbreak of bird flu this fall may increase turkey prices by reducing the supply of available healthy turkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks during the fall migration can lead to the culling of large numbers of birds in an attempt to stop the spread. This can result in a shrinking overall flock size and higher prices due to tighter production and decreased supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the recent government shutdown and revised policies of U.S. government agencies, an accurate representation of this season's bird flu outbreak may be unavailable to many. This could leave experts without the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Because of the government shutdown, I know less than I would normally know," &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/health/h5n1-bird-flu.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&amp;amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about bird flu?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike previous outbreaks, the current bird flu outbreak has persisted for years and has been confirmed in every U.S. state at some point since 2022.

Difficulty sleeping through the night, restless tossing, and frequent daytime naps are common early warning signs. In later stages, patients often experience "sundowning," a period of increased confusion and agitation that tends to occur later in the day. These patterns hint at a close relationship between Alzheimer's progression and the circadian system -- the internal body clock that regulates sleep, wakefulness, and other daily biological cycles. Until recently, however, scientists did not fully understand how deeply this connection ran.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has now demonstrated, in mouse models, that Alzheimer's disease disrupts circadian rhythms within specific brain cells. This disturbance alters how and when hundreds of genes switch on and off, changing key processes that help the brain function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published October 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that restoring or stabilizing these internal rhythms could open up a new approach to treating Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those," said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte &amp;amp; Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice engineered to model the disease, these genes no longer followed their usual daily patterns. "Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer's genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burden of Sleep Disruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musiek, who co-directs the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and specializes in aging and dementia, noted that disturbed sleep is one of the most frequent problems reported by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. His earlier work showed that sleep changes begin years before memory loss becomes evident. Beyond exhaustion for both patients and caregivers, these disruptions create stress that may accelerate the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle, he said, starts with identifying where it begins. The body's circadian system regulates roughly 20% of all genes in the human genome, orchestrating vital processes such as digestion, immune response, and sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier research, Musiek identified a protein called YKL-40 that naturally fluctuates throughout the day and helps control normal levels of amyloid in the brain. Too much YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer's risk in humans, can trigger the build-up of amyloid -- a sticky protein that forms plaques, one of the hallmarks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amyloid's Effect on the Brain's Timing Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Alzheimer's symptoms follow a repeating daily pattern, the team suspected more circadian-regulated proteins and genes might be involved. In the new study, they examined gene activity in the brains of mice that developed amyloid build-up, as well as in healthy young mice and older mice without plaques. Samples were collected every two hours over a full 24-hour period to track how gene expression changed across the circadian cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that amyloid deposits disrupted the normal rhythm of hundreds of genes in two key types of brain cells -- microglia and astrocytes. Microglia act as the brain's immune cells, clearing away waste and harmful materials, while astrocytes help neurons communicate and maintain healthy function. Many of the affected genes are normally responsible for microglia's ability to remove waste, including amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these genes were not entirely switched off, their usual order and timing became chaotic, weakening the brain's coordinated system for removing toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Rhythms and Potential Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that amyloid plaques appeared to create new rhythmic patterns in genes that do not usually follow a daily cycle. Many of these genes are involved in inflammation or the brain's response to stress and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musiek, these discoveries suggest that therapies aimed at adjusting circadian rhythms in microglia and astrocytes could support healthier brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types," he said. "Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the National Institute on Aging (R01AG054517, T32AG058518), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01NS102272), and the National Institutes of Health (R00AG061231).

Because what happens when you have elevated blood pressure? That causes injury to the lining of your blood vessels in your body. And that injury results in a buildup of plaques known as atherosclerosis. And these plaques, as they build up, narrow the blood vessels. And once the blood vessels narrow, you get less blood flow to your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Hoeflinger added: “Particularly if you get less blood flow to the heart or brain, that can result in a heart attack or stroke, which can be fatal. Unfortunately, up to 50 percent of the people that have high blood pressure don't have symptoms from it and don't even know that they have it. And so that's why it's called the silent killer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to lower your blood pressure naturally?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to know more about managing high blood pressure or reducing your risk factors?

		&lt;p&gt;Cold evenings, busy shelters and anxious owners raise the same question: how do you settle an adult dog with calm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the UK, rescues expect a seasonal rise in adult adoptions as nights draw in. A clear first fortnight reduces stress, prevents bites and cuts the risk of returns. Here is a practical roadmap for people bringing home a grown dog, with costs, timings and simple steps that build trust quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why autumn adoptions demand a plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter days, wet pavements and fireworks can rattle even the steadiest rescue dog. Many arrive with an emotional history and unfamiliar routines. Homes feel noisy. Streets smell different. A plan narrows the world, adds predictability and stops misunderstandings from snowballing into anxiety or reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one is about safety, not affection quotas. Reduce choices, give structure, and let the dog opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set up a safe base within one hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the dog steps inside, prepare a quiet corner away from through-traffic and doorways. Choose a draft-free spot near warmth, but not next to a radiator that could overheat a resting body. Keep it stable for the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Room layout that lowers cortisol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy, non-slip bed or crate with the door open for choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh water within two metres, changed twice daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two tough chews to channel stress into licking and gnawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baby gate to manage access without confrontation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft cloth with familiar scent if provided by the rescue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set feeding and walking at predictable times. Use the same tone of voice and the same short phrases. Predictability reduces uncertainty, which reduces adrenaline spikes and barking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 7-day routine that calms adult dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Day(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Focus&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Practical measure&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1–2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Decompression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short garden breaks, house tour on lead, one room base camp, gentle hand-feeding.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3–4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Safe walks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two 15-minute walks on a Y-harness, quiet streets, allow sniffing, no greetings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5–7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Light training&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Three 3-minute sessions: name response, settle on mat, swap game for toys.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchor mealtimes 10–12 hours apart. Keep play brief and frequent. Sleep drives recovery; an adult rescue may need up to 16 hours of rest spread across the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five mistakes that cost you time, money and trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much freedom, too soon. Roaming leads to toilet slips and guarding. Use doors, pens and routines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing introductions. Crowds, pubs and family parties overwhelm. Start with one person at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipping the early vet check. Hidden pain fuels growls. Budget £120–£180 for a baseline consult and core vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using only a collar. A secure harness plus ID tag reduces escapes and injury; expect £25–£40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correcting fear with scolding. Fear punished becomes fear plus you. Pay calm, reward curiosity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour is often a pain story. Treat discomfort and half the “naughtiness” fades without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health check in 48 hours: what to ask your vet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book an appointment within two days. Bring any rescue paperwork and note changes you observe at home. Ask targeted questions to build a health baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccinations, microchip registration and parasite cover plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral health: gum inflammation and worn teeth affect mood and food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobility: screen for arthritis and cruciate issues; request a pain trial if murky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: set a target range and feeding grams, not “cups”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin and ears: rule out allergies that drive rubbing and snapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise sensitivity ahead of fireworks: consider desensitisation and vet-approved aids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading the small signals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult dogs speak softly before they shout. Ears pinned, head turns, slow blinking and yawning show discomfort. Lip licking outside mealtimes can flag tension. A stiff tail says caution, not confidence. When you notice uneasy signals, reduce demands, add space and switch to calm, low-arousal tasks like scenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, lower the ask, raise the distance, and pay the calm you want to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social introductions without the meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People first, then pets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One visitor at a time, seated, no looming over the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the dog the choice to approach; no touching unless they request it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scatter a handful of treats away from feet to relieve social pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walking beyond the postcode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-clip the lead to harness and collar for backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start at quiet times; add busier places for short intervals mid-walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep ID on at all times; update the microchip record the same day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The calm contact method that builds trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think “I am available, not insistent”. Sit on the floor with a turned shoulder and relaxed hands. Drop snacks next to you without eye contact. If the dog checks in, gently stroke chest or shoulder for two seconds, then stop and let them ask again. Short, predictable kindness beats marathon cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training that lowers stress fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle on a mat: reward any glance or paw on the mat. Build to 60 seconds of relaxed resting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand targeting: dog taps your palm, you pay. Handy for redirection away from triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap cue: present treat, say “swap”, take toy only after the dog releases. Prevents guarding rows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep sessions tiny. Three minutes, three times a day, in the quietest room. Progress comes from repetition, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to do when setbacks appear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many adult dogs follow the 3-3-3 pattern: three days to decompress, three weeks to learn the routine, three months to feel at home. Expect wobbles around week three as confidence grows. Regression is common after busy weekends. Dial back the schedule, rebuild the routine and practise the calm contact method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra help when history is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If behaviour feels sticky, book two sessions with a reward-based trainer accredited by a UK body. Bring video clips from daily life, a sleep log and a list of triggers. One well-timed change—like moving the bed or swapping the route—often releases the knot more than a dozen corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Added gains you can bank this month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgeting protects the bond. Price your first-month essentials: £120–£180 vet baseline, £40 harness and lead, £25 tag and bowls, £30 bedding, £20 chews and food puzzles. Pet insurance reduces shocks; look at excess amounts and dental cover. Keep receipts; charities may offer discounts if you adopted from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For enrichment, think nose, not speed. Scatter feeding in the garden, a rolled towel with kibble for unwrapping, cardboard “parcel” puzzles and short scent trails indoors drain stress without overexciting. Rotate toys every two days so novelty works for you. A calm brain learns. A predictable home heals. And a measured first week pays off for years.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Zaghiyan advises avoiding red meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork. “There's about an 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer in people who regularly consume red meat. We don't know of a safe amount, and if you're charring your meat, i.e. cooking it over a flame, that adds even more risk,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second on the surgeon’s list is processed meats such as bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, salami, pepperoni, and deli meats. “Any of these are processed meats, and they increase your risk of colorectal cancer by 15 to 35% if you're eating one serving a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less you eat, the better. There is no defined safe amount,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweetened beverages&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, sugary drinks are not just adding extra calories; they are also a red flag for your overall health. Store-bought juices, carbonated sodas, and fizzy drinks may taste sweet, but they are making your health bitter. “These beverages are artificially sugared with high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and fructose, and consumption of these has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer. A study found that two servings a day of sugared beverages doubled your risk of colorectal cancer versus those individuals who had it less than once a week,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer? Quit, or at least limit, alcohol intake. Dr Zaghiyan emphasises that this includes beer and wine. “This is particularly magnified in individuals who consume alcohol daily. However, there is no safe amount that has been defined. Alcohol not only increases your risk of colorectal cancer, but it also increases your risk of multiple other cancers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods such as chips or ready-to-eat noodles are convenient, but they come at the hidden cost of your health. The colorectal cancer surgeon suggests avoiding anything that comes pre-packaged. “These include chips, packaged cereals, packaged baked goods, and a lot of store-bought breads. All fall into the category of ultra-processed foods,” she explained. The doctor adds that these foods are linked with an increased risk of various gut conditions and colorectal cancer. Why? “Due to the existence of emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, and various additional additives like food dyes that come in these foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor also suggests increasing the intake of whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to minimise risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

In total, biopsies from more than 4,000 men will be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool, which analyses digitised biopsy images to produce a personalised risk score, has already &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;been shown in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to identify which men with high-risk prostate cancer would be most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, trials in the US have suggested it could also be used for less aggressive forms of prostate cancer to predict which men are most likely to benefit from having hormone therapy in addition to radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, studies have suggested the tool can help identify which patients can be monitored without the need for immediate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “If and when this gets implemented, you could use one tool irrespective of where you are on the aggressiveness scale, to make a very clinically and life-enhancingly important decision for each of those men.”. He added that the tool was already being widely used in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new study will first use prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, and have suitable follow-up data, to explore whether the predictive prowess of the tool is seen when applied to UK patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool will then be tested at three sites – North Bristol NHS trust, Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde – as men undergo the normal pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Biopsies will be analysed, the treatment choices will be made, and the man will start treatment. But at the same time, the NHS clinicians will be given a readout from this tool and asked: ‘If you had this, would you have recommended the same treatment or not?’” said Hobbs, adding that part of the trial would also explore to what extent the tool affected the time between diagnosis and treatment choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say the hope is that the tool will eventually help reduce under- and over-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A good outcome from this is that this tool is implemented in the NHS,” said Hobbs. However, for that to happen, he said, it had to be shown to be scientifically valid, cost-effective, and making a difference to treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Gerhardt Attard, from University College London, who was involved in the study around abiraterone use but is not part of the trial, said the research was important as approaches often worked well in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When you take that to the real NHS world, there are a number of challenges and differences that would inevitably arise and that’s what this study will address,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ashley Dalton, the minister for public health and prevention, also welcomed the trial. “This groundbreaking research could be a huge step forward, demonstrating the power of technology to potentially transform lives and improve cancer outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is exactly why we’re investing in a digital NHS. By harnessing AI and moving beyond outdated systems, we can transform cancer care – diagnosing earlier, treating more effectively, and improving patient experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNVWY3RlFVcm1ZTXBTSGpCMjlKcnprNnNSMl9xS0ZFblhZaXZuRmRQdnJGUXNXN2FoMHdaTDFSaVF1RUlsRHpOZ2ZoTGM1RVJzdTBHVVZVUF9fUldwQjlfYWt6aUhpaGtDb0hXQXBlVkJ4bkhvODU3MklQM0k2T2ZvNmdTS1NDbkFDOGhxVl84c0xiQ2dpNTN5QzJLUFhHbnRUcWhmTzZpamxkV19rNEZQTEtYSENVSkFmWkdVcUN2UlI</guid></item><item><title>男性需要比女性锻炼更多才能降低心脏病。原因如下。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/men-need-to-exercise-more-than-women-to-lower-heart-disease-heres-why</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Exercise is like medicine for the heart, and just like with medication, you need the right "dose" for it to be effective. But a recent study suggests that the dose might not be the same for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that men need roughly twice as much exercise as women to see the same reduction in their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-disease-329"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-025-00732-z"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; asked over 85,000 UK adults aged 37-73 to wear an accelerometer (a device that measures body movement and activity levels) on their wrist for seven days. They then tracked each participant's health outcomes for just under eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-heartbeat-budget-could-help-keep-track-of-your-health-study-suggests"&gt;A 'Heartbeat Budget' Could Help Keep Track of Your Health, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who did roughly four hours of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week – activities, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or dancing, which raise your breathing and heart rate – had around a 30% lower risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men needed to do roughly nine hours of the same types of physical activity to see a similar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg" alt="man riding a bike" class="wp-image-179856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Men need to do twice as much exercise as women to reduce heart disease risk by the same amount. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI_kBvy3g/"&gt;ArtistGNDphotography/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also true for people already living with heart disease. The paper estimated that women diagnosed with coronary heart disease needed to do around 51 minutes of physical activity each week to reduce their risk of death from any cause by 30% – while men needed to do around 85 minutes of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings might sound shocking to the average person, they confirm something that exercise scientists have suspected for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a clear biological reason that can partly help explain why women and men see such different results from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biological differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women typically have higher oestrogen levels than men. This hormone has important effects on how the body responds to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen can help the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2004-1743"&gt;burn more fat for fuel&lt;/a&gt; during endurance exercise and helps keep the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-017-0152-8"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; healthy – partly by supporting their energy-producing mitochondria (the tiny powerhouses inside cells that generate energy for vital functions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also tend to have more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.24091"&gt;slow-twitch muscle fibres&lt;/a&gt;, which are efficient and fatigue-resistant. These muscles suit the kinds of steady, sustained physical activity most exercise guidelines recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the gap in "minutes needed" for similar heart benefits between women and men isn't as shocking as the findings might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study used &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169649"&gt;device-measured activity&lt;/a&gt;, instead of asking people to recall from memory the amount of activity they did, this means the data on physical activity was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note the study still showed a graded benefit. More total weekly activity was linked to lower risk of coronary heart disease in both women and men. Everyone gains from moving more. The difference is just in how much activity buys the same reduction in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not claim that women should do less exercise – nor that men can't reach similar benefits. It only shows that men may need more weekly activity to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-179859 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Women still need to do the recommended amount of exercise each week to keep their hearts healthy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGxWNwr2I0/"&gt;Artem Varnitsin/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are limits to keep in mind. Activity was measured for only one week – then people were followed for about eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as it's an observational study, other factors that could have partly influenced the results were not taken into account – such as menopausal status (when oestrogen levels drop significantly) or whether a woman was using hormone replacement therapy (which can restore some oestrogen levels). These factors could influence how women's bodies responded to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that the volunteers came from the UK Biobank study. These volunteers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx246"&gt;tend to be healthier&lt;/a&gt; and less deprived than the general population – factors which can affect baseline heart health, access to safe places to exercise and time available for physical activity. This can affect how widely the results apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these results make an important point about current exercise recommendations and whether they need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current exercise guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1451"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the American Heart Association and the NHS are sex-neutral. But this new study challenges these recommendations – showing they might not apply equally to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, most exercise research was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/12908"&gt;done predominantly in men&lt;/a&gt; and results were often assumed to apply equally to women. As better device-based data arrives, we're learning that women and men may get different returns for the same number of active minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because women and men &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.117.004437"&gt;experience heart disease differently&lt;/a&gt; – from symptoms to outcomes. If the amount of exercise needed to reach the same benefit also differs, our advice should reflect that while still keeping things simple and practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't about telling women to exercise less. The 150-minute baseline remains a useful target – &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.12.019"&gt;and many people don't yet meet it&lt;/a&gt;. What these findings suggest is that women who meet current targets may see more heart health benefits per minute of exercise. That's encouraging news for anyone who struggles to find time for longer workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men, the message isn't "double your gym time". It's to keep building activity in ways that fit your week – with more total minutes bringing even greater heart health benefits. Whether different types or intensities of exercise might be more efficient for men remains a question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men and women clearly benefit from regular physical activity. That's not in question. But what does need to be recognised is the clear biological differences that influence the returns men and women see from the same types of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001289"&gt;Cardiac rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; and exercise referral schemes often set identical targets for men and women. This new research suggests we may want to rethink schemes and tailor goals to each person's starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until cardiac rehabilitation becomes more personalised, the core message for now is: move more, sit less. Aim for the baseline 150 minutes of exercise each week if you can. More helps if you're able to.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268624/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

"In recent years I went through almost every possible type of treatment, conventional or unconventional, and received medications in insane doses - morphine in quantities of between 5 to 10 mg each time. It turns you into a zombie, and it's terrible," he adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="84oso-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="84oso-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="84oso-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Despite the disability he was born with, Yoav managed to maintain his independence throughout his life - "studies, degrees, great jobs, relocation, I did everything people dream about most," he says, noting that despite the disability he got a driver's license and was even the first disabled volunteer to go to officers' training course. However, about two years ago, the pain became unbearable, and he was forced to leave his job and invest most of his efforts in finding a solution. "It's a terrible feeling because it's as if all the independence you had suddenly disappears."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="cnl8v-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="cnl8v-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cnl8v-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This past February, almost by chance, his mother came across an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="SkaSqcqWUJ11l" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/rkm1tsx9ye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cnl8v-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;article published on ynet about nerve pacemaker implants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cnl8v-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; that help reduce chronic pain by regulating electrical activity in the spinal cord. The article was written by Dr. Ruth Gur, director of the Center for Neurosurgical Pain Treatment at the Pain Institute at Sheba Medical Center and a specialist in neurosurgery and pain medicine. "What was written there ultimately wasn't suitable for me, but it was an initial opening to contact Dr. Gur, who eventually helped us find the solution," Yoav says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="492bm-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="492bm-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="492bm-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Implanting electrodes on nerves to control pain is a known procedure that has been performed for decades on patients suffering from severe chronic pain whom previous treatments failed to help. Dr. Ruth Gur explains that in these cases, spinal pacemakers are used that are implanted inside the body - and their electrodes reach the spinal cord to control the electrical signal in the cord and disperse the pain signals. "The electrodes essentially create an electrical field at certain frequencies that mimics nerve activity and 'dresses' the painful nerves, and we transmit through the electrodes something that masks the natural conduction of pain, meaning we block it," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="2gbt4-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx" id="image_ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/02/H100wT641Wg/H100wT641Wg_0_0_2048_1366_0_x-large.jpg" alt='ד"ר אדריאן גרינפלד וד"ר רות גור בעת השתלת קוצב עצבי נגד כאב בבית החולים שיבא' title="Dr. Adrian Greenfeld and Dr. Ruth Gur during a neural pacemaker implantation procedure for pain relief at Sheba Medical Center.

Dr. Gur explains that nerves usually have a long course, for example a leg nerve passes from the spinal cord to the tip of the foot. "Say someone was injured by shrapnel in the ankle, I can implant the pacemaker at knee or thigh level, far from that injury, and it will have an effect. But with Yoav, the anatomical damage and the surgeries he underwent over the years caused distortions along the entire nerve pathways. There's no person like him in the world with such an anatomical structure, and therefore even though the technology exists, we had to reinvent the wheel with the surgery." The one who operated with her is Dr. Adrian Greenfeld, a specialist in anesthesia and pain medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Surgery that hasn't been done anywhere in the world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Despite the complexity, Dr. Gur didn't give up, and presented Yoav with the option of an exceptional surgery, with an approach to a central nerve junction that passes from the cervical spine near the collarbone area. During the surgery, the electrode is implanted on the nerve itself under live viewing of the electrode advancement by ultrasound according to a pattern designed based on an MRI performed in advance. Dr. Gur notes that the device is wireless, meaning the pacemaker is outside the body - and connected to it is an antenna that sits on the skin and transmits into a receiver located inside the electrode. From there the electrode transmits the electrical signals opposite to the electrical signals of the pain nerves - into the damaged nerve. "This specific surgery hasn't been done anywhere in the world," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="95upb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="95upb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="95upb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Gur explains that the main challenge in the surgery lies in its execution, in advance planning and in the sophistication required, as well as in the need for absolute precision in implanting the pacemaker on a specific nerve, given Yoav's complex anatomical structure. According to her, there was much deliberation before the surgery. "There were too many question marks. And yet, we took a calculated risk because it's definitely still within our capabilities," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yoav says that the doctor who accompanied him in Canada did offer him a surgical option, but according to him what brought him to come specifically to Israel was the high level of medicine in the country, as well as the long waiting times in Canada, which can reach even three years. "The clinic didn't even get around to making initial contact with me, and it was impossible to wait with this," he said. Later it turned out that the surgery offered to him in Canada wasn't at all suitable for his special anatomical case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="6s9tp-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx" id="image_ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/02/Skx111jv4y11x/Skx111jv4y11x_0_150_853_480_0_x-large.jpg" alt='יואב רוקח פן עבר ניתוח השתלת קוצבים עצביים שמסייעים בהפחתת כאב כרוני על ידי ד"ר רות גור במרכז הרפואי שיבא' title="Yoav Rokach Penn and Dr. Ruth Gur at Sheba Medical Center

"Suddenly there's light," he says. "Since the surgery I haven't taken any pain medication. If the pain was around 9 out of 10 before, today it's 1. I didn't believe it would work at this level, and certainly not so quickly, I was very skeptical. During the week or so that have passed since the surgery I kept convincing myself it wasn't working, that it was just post-surgery euphoria. There's also fear of disappointment after so many attempts, but after I was in a follow-up with Dr. Gur, she told me 'it's not placebo or euphoria, it's an implant that's working'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Dr. Gur, the success in Yoav's surgery is an opening for patients who until now received a negative answer. "It gives us an understanding that we can use this technology also in exceptional things that aren't by the book," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Pain of nerve origin can occur from a variety of causes - combat injury, car accidents, surgeries, and even nerve pain due to herniated disc or chronic inflammation. Dr. Gur explains that pain medicine, by any means, cannot cure the basic problem that caused the pain. "I can't restore a hand that was amputated or reverse a condition after spinal surgery. The goal of pain medicine is to improve the patient's quality of life as much as possible, but we can never predict with absolute certainty in advance if it will help, and if so, how much it will help. We define success as a reduction of 40%-50% of the pain."Retry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 18:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBSWEh3eGdOVXRmYTVRd05fTUYxTFRYbTctVUlMbjJHWURJU283T2FsWENzTXRmWWM5WG1ocjE4bFB3NTUtUjFsd0ZsZFBpM05KUGZrTHdWWmptd091T2Q2RzZKX3RtVmJm</guid></item><item><title>为什么这项临床试验给一些年轻的癌症患者带来了希望-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/11/01/children-cancer-clinical-trial-solid-tumors/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWE7YLHN5FDZTERD72FTOVOQAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Years of caring for children with solid tumors and looking into the eyes of parents starved for hope have led Catherine Bollard to what she calls the most important moment of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VSXFKHFQRBIVJKFKFQS7DT2RE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children’s National Hospital, where Bollard is senior vice president and chief research officer, is poised to start recruiting children with pediatric sarcomas and other solid tumors that have resisted chemotherapy and radiation for a clinical trial that will use an inventive new technique to combat one of the most persistent problems in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 17:00:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNOEFYb3RIRUZNbEx3Y0RHeGQ0eVJ6OWk5U3FkYkp0S2xibm16TWszazJWVUtUUUlMV2IwQ1Z5RllrODdiWjZmZVoxcTljSXVjZHZMeklUYXZDMVdEc3QtMENuYk9Cemh1ajlNWkx4UFpNMFNrNG5IM2Z4V1Rsd1RwbHNEUW4zcndWZk9LMGtjTUxkUXhTYmhGQVBB</guid></item><item><title>不仅仅是油炸食品！血管外科医生警告6种常见食物会增加心脏病发作的风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/not-just-fried-food-vascular-surgeon-warns-of-6-common-foods-that-raise-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/125032461.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to heart health, it is not always the obvious dangers that harm us; it is the everyday food items that we eat, without a second thought. The symptoms for heart-related problems are not dramatic as much; they are slow, silent, and gradually build up in our arteries that can lead to a life-changing event. Vascular surgeon, Dr. Sumit Kapadia, with 18 years of experience, cautions that even the foods that we find comforting might quietly be increasing the risk of heart attacks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shockingly, it's not just fried rare treats or greasy food-seemingly harmless staples and trendy packaged foods open the gateway to arterial damage. The danger lies in how these six food groups, cherished and widely consumed, quietly raise blood pressure, blood sugar, and inflammation until your arteries cry out for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Processed Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed items like seekh kebabs, sausages, salami, and mutton curries are full of saturated fat and sodium. With time, these foods harden the arteries and provoke inflammation, acting as a main reason for heart problems. High saturated fat levels gradually lead to a buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, while too much sodium increases blood pressure, both of which contribute to arterial hardening and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What starts as an occasional indulgence can, over the years, turn into a major risk factor if not balanced with healthier choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried street food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samosas, pakoras, bhajiyas, puris, and French fries aren’t just tempting; they’re risky when cooked in reused oils, which produce dangerous trans fats. These fats do more than just clog your arteries; they accelerate plaque buildup and amplify the risk of heart attacks, even in the young and healthy. Reused oils produce trans fat, a harmful type that clogs the arteries and also triggers inflammation and plaque buildup inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Refined carbs &amp;amp; maida-based food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our favourite food options, like white bread, naan, pav, biscuits, pastries, and bakery puff, are prepared with refined flour-also known as maida or refined flour. These quickly raise blood sugar levels and initiate body-wide inflammation, promoting the development of cholesterol-rich plaques in the heart arteries. Over time, these constant fluctuations can lead to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweetened drinks &amp;amp; packaged juices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-loaded colas, energy drinks, canned fruit juices, and flavored lassis might sound refreshing, but they raise triglyceride levels and put additional pressure on your heart. Consuming these drinks daily has been related to the risk of sudden cardiac death as they interfere with heart rhythm and blood lipids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High salt in pickles, namkee, and other foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian meals are always full of pickles, 'papad', instant noodles, chips, and salty snacks, all loaded with sodium. High intake of salt retains water in your body and heightens blood pressure, inviting heart attacks and strokes. This is the risk which, for many, lies hidden in the taste of daily favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, instant noodles, frozen parathas, ready-to-eat curries, chips, and packaged sauces come packed with hidden fats, sugar, and preservatives. Each serving of ultra-processed food can increase your heart risk by an alarming 7 percent—proof that convenience at the cost of health is rarely worth it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning that can save lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice of Dr. Kapadia is the same, yet very powerful: avoid these six food groups and shut the entrance door to future heart attacks. Every meal we eat might be small, last a few minutes, but it requires us to make powerful choices that shape our heart's future. Let those choices be guided by awareness and balance. A little mindfulness goes a long way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choices you make at every meal quietly shape your cardiovascular fate, so let wisdom guide your plate.

While dopamine levels did increase in some individuals, this variability was not associated with whether a person had a normal weight, was overweight, or had obesity. The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured products made mostly from refined ingredients and additives, with little or no whole foods. They are often engineered to be highly palatable, so that consuming them engages the brain’s reward circuits more intensely than natural foods do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is usually achieved by ensuring that ultra-processed foods contain large quantities of easily digestible sugars and fats. Because humans have separate neural pathways connecting the gut to the brain’s reward areas that are triggered by fats and sugars, eating foods rich in both is often more rewarding than eating foods rich in fats or in sugars alone. This is particularly true if these sugars and fats are easier to digest than those found in natural foods, as is the case with many industrially added sugars and fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intense reward potential has led to a popular theory that ultra-processed foods may be addictive. The core of this theory is the idea that their consumption elicits an outsized dopamine response in the brain’s reward regions, a surge similar in nature to that caused by drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this model, this powerful initial reward reinforces consumption. Over time, repeated exposure is thought to cause the brain to adapt, leading to a down-regulation of dopamine receptors and a blunted response. This state, known as tolerance, could then compel an individual to consume even more of the food to achieve the same initial level of pleasure, creating a cycle of compulsive eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this hypothesis that study author Valerie L. Darcey and her colleagues set out to test. They investigated whether humans exhibited an exaggerated dopamine release after drinking a milkshake, a food frequently used in studies as a proxy for an ultra-processed product because it is rich in both easily digestible fat and sugars and often contains flavor-enhancing additives. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in this process; it is a chemical messenger that helps signal reward and motivation in the brain, reinforcing behaviors that lead to pleasurable or satisfying experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 50 young, healthy adults, 38 of whom were women. They were recruited to cover a full range of body mass index values, with roughly even numbers of participants with normal weight, overweight, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After joining the study, participants were supplied with meals designed to provide the exact number of calories needed to maintain their current body weight for a period of 3-5 days. All meals were prepared in the NIH Clinical Center Nutrition Department Metabolic Kitchen with all foods and beverages weighed on a gram scale. Participants were instructed to consume all the foods and beverages they were given. Any food and beverages not consumed were returned and weighed. This procedure aimed to stabilize their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this period, participants were admitted to the center that carried out the study for several days, where they continued taking similar meals under observation. On the day of the experiment, participants first completed positron emission tomography (PET) scans of their brains in the morning, after having fasted overnight. After that, they rested for 75 minutes, at the end of which they received a glass of vanilla milkshake to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes after drinking the milkshake, participants had their second PET scan. They also provided ratings of how pleasant the milkshake was, whether they wanted more, and how it compared to their expectations. Participants also completed several assessments of food-related behaviors, experiences, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed no significant average increase in dopamine after drinking a milkshake in the striatum region of the brain. The study’s authors focused on the striatum because it is a brain region central to the reward system that processes dopamine signals. They found pronounced differences between individuals in how their striatum reacted to the milkshake, but these differences were not associated with participants’ adiposity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, while the brains of some individuals reacted to the milkshake by releasing dopamine, the brains of others did not, and the presence or intensity of this reaction was not related to a participant’s body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data indicated that dopamine responses might be related to how hungry participants felt and how enjoyable they found the milkshake to be. The dopamine response was also found to be weakly associated with the ad libitum (free) intake of ultra-processed cookies. This means that individuals whose brains reacted to the milkshake with a greater dopamine release tended to eat more cookies later when given the opportunity to eat as much as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing the findings in the context of whether ultra-processed foods can be considered addictive, the study’s authors concluded that “post-ingestive striatal dopamine responses to an ultra-processed milkshake were likely substantially smaller than for many addictive drugs and below the limits of detection using standard PET methods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of neural processes related to food intake. However, the authors note that the study did not include a control group. The design compared dopamine levels before and after drinking the milkshake. Therefore, the possibility remains that other factors could have influenced the changes in dopamine observed in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain dopamine responses to ultra-processed milkshakes are highly variable and not significantly related to adiposity in humans&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Valerie L.

If his wife is upset by this, and there is almost zero chance the drinking will be less, it seems like continuing the play another time will just lead to more hurt. Is there a way through this? The husband is not interested in moving forward if his wife is hurt by his drunken behavior, but is it worth trying again if his intent is to be more conscious of how his wife is doing during play?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu2o001i3b78o1i8xdlh@published"&gt;I think the most prudent thing to do here is to consider what the emotional fallout will be if the same thing were to happen again. You’ve written your letter in a hypothetical voice without identifying yourself, which is uncommon for this column, but I have a hunch that if you’re in this configuration, you’re the wife. If that is true, envision what a scenario will be like if your husband follows the same pattern. Will it be upsetting, devastating, relationship-upending? Something else? What exactly would you be risking if the worst-case scenario were to play out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu5j001j3b78b9mcmkky@published"&gt;One positive here is that the husband no longer can claim plausible deniability should he zero in on a single target and others’ feelings catch strays in the process. He knows what happened last time. If alcohol clouded his judgement, he should take it upon himself to drink less—if getting loaded in the presence of available alcohol (and nonmonogamous sex) is an inevitability, that may signal an issue with substances or a general discomfort with this kind of play. Both should be interrogated. I know people love to get drunk and screw, but if they &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; get drunk to screw, they might want to think about why and consider other means of social lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu91001k3b78jzdthyr0@published"&gt;Another positive here is that he actively does not want to upset his wife again, which suggests he’s learning. Now is the time for the wife to voice her boundaries and for him to accept them. If these are successfully adhered to, you will both have grown from a negative situation, perhaps rendering it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fuc7001l3b783575zfk0@published"&gt;So, I say give him another chance unless you (I mean … the wife) are fairly sure that a repetition of the first time will cause irreparable damage. Obviously, he’s extremely into another woman there and part of the point of this kind of play is for people to have their fun. But it truly should not be to the exclusion of everything else, including consideration for one’s partner. If he truly cannot maintain that very meager standard, this kind of play should probably be taken off the table entirely. But you should also consider the fact that his interest for at least one other woman will likely endure whether you go forward and incorporate her into group sex or not. If the very fact of his attraction is bothersome or distracting, it may deserve a sober discussion and your own efforts to come to terms with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t enjoy anal, either. I love closeness and intimacy, including kissing and cuddling, and I am happy to give orally, but getting my dick sucked does nothing for me, nor does penetrating another guy and nor does bottoming. None of it is uncomfortable and I enjoy giving pleasure to others, but none of it is as satisfying as masturbation. Is there something wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe this is just how you are, and all the psychological searching you can muster (alone and/or with a therapist) won’t give you any answers. Maybe you just know what you like and what you don’t. Giving pleasure is a great thing, and there are guys who identify as cocksuckers who know this well. If masturbation is your primary vehicle for pleasure, maybe you’re a bator. Maybe you are somewhere on the asexuality spectrum (some deep thinking on the subject, by reading a book like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9CeMsuUoEMrPtAf932EMoLkRyJt6T1oNSaxDjzaUcPCOq_oYAMscOBxFhdZleUV1LR82ic00Rf3f9R6vBc4xHiqVBPMyR7Bmf7ZiSoYVFfRLif6TptxOirtny5lNPHmXyg.R-bIgGONNmYTuYiVCC65wBJvxqdmM7QGNVgmJnemEHA&amp;amp;qid=1761851333&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or browsing/participating in the discussion at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/"&gt;r/asexuality&lt;/a&gt; could be useful). Maybe none of these labels appeal to you. My sense is that you’re navigating your body’s responses to sex very well and still finding activities that are fun. If you can be at peace with where you are sexually, that’s more than can be said for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9q76u002y3b78bae8cffj@published"&gt;If, however, this is distressing and something you’d like to work on changing, definitely seek the services of a therapist (preferably a sex therapist, or even a sex coach) who can help you sort out whether these feelings might be a response to something that’s happened in your life or just a regular facet of your particular sexuality. There are no guarantees that you will be changed by the process—nor do I think you need to be—but the more you think about it and the more you attempt to work on it, the more likely such a change will occur. We can’t say for certain what’s going on from here, but if you’ve exhausted all potential reasons and this continues to bother you, you may want to look into whether what you’re experiencing is sexual anhedonia, a condition marked by an inability to feel sexual pleasure. It has many &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a43455963/sexual-anhedonia/"&gt;potential causes&lt;/a&gt;, physical (like low testosterone, neurological issues, or medication) and psychological (depression, performance anxiety), alike. A visit to a doctor, hopefully one with whom you are comfortable discussing sex, may be illuminating. Let them know what’s going on, as they may want to run tests.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s been begging to try this since early on in our relationship. I’ve always hesitated because it took me a while to open up to and get comfortable with being eaten out in the first place.

Still, if you fear there’s any poop lingering around your rectum that may present itself during play, washing out a few times with water (filter it if you’re using tap and the water in your area isn’t suited for drinking) with a small bulb (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Men-Detachable-Reusable-Capacity/dp/B0C6B2B35B/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.c8CU8QHctZ3sGts0WvMHmvu6QH0tc5liZAZiOcWJEsd2So5iHTlt6ZDVvMduKgaAYjDVxOWW9RS-YTDOHHVzg38iNlfH07YWYroNtbvx6Td4vy8vE5a4QqG_aLGvKwcohX_8ROAG3oW3F8vvqXiro1KtF9Vuofmy1HC-edQC8j5Mw3cNzdHKTAIWeIQgQ7nsZgtc6Bvj_-e12VFNmedQ8fUx8zKym5164SI1gNL_xzEACqHIa8bWe6RnSKvDeFHvXW9GaBmGSvACEn1r2l3rr2uk6Os_9MeH_hkRX_payKM.oMYVURE242HER0a2ad8fv2qPX0MAs70fvCf-b5A6GF4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=stay+ready+douche&amp;amp;qid=1761506961&amp;amp;sr=8-8"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) may help you feel hygienically secure.

A mishap is unlikely to turn him off entirely. Or if it does, then you’d be no worse off than you are now—at least you will have tried this thing that you’re both curious about. So try to put those concerns out of your mind if you’re going to go forward with this. Probably the most effective thing you can do is just go through with it—take necessary steps to clean yourself as much as possible and let him have at it. You may gain a lot of confidence and security when the ass eating goes off without a hitch. It’ll show you that you can do this and make next time even easier to get into. Of course, if you do feel discomfort, unclean or any kind of vague negativity, you have every right to stop the session, but I would follow my curiosity if I were &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because I’m lucky enough to orgasm in that way. Occasionally, I’ll have an enjoyable orgasm that’s a little more restrained. But for the most part, I’m full-on Meg Ryan in the restaurant scene in &lt;em&gt;When Harry met Sally&lt;/em&gt;, except mine is real and not at all a performance. I realize this is the opposite of a problem. However, my question is: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/loud-climax-sex-advice.html"&gt;Have most or even all of my partners assumed I’m probably faking it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You may find yourself jumping quickly from one thing to the next, struggling to focus, and feeling restless offline because life seems slower than your online feed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She explains that modern lifestyles, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/social-media" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="social media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, and continuous digital exposure have reshaped brain activity. “Your brain craves novelty, and devices exploit this craving, keeping you in a state of hyper-alertness. Over time, this can drain your energy, increase stress, reduce focus, and even affect sleep," Dr Sukul adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/vitaly-gariev-TTcTl02R9Ts-unsplash_1762094031595.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Sukul highlights Popcorn Brain, a condition affecting focus and emotional well-being due to excessive screen time.(Unsplash)" title="Dr Sukul highlights Popcorn Brain, a condition affecting focus and emotional well-being due to excessive screen time.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Sukul highlights Popcorn Brain, a condition affecting focus and emotional well-being due to excessive screen time.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is affected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Popcorn Brain is most commonly seen in teenagers and young adults, Dr Sukul warns it is also affecting people aged 30-45. “It’s not the same as internet addiction,” she clarifies. “Internet &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/addiction" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="addiction"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; is a clinical syndrome that disrupts work, relationships, and daily life. Popcorn Brain affects your quality of life, attention, and emotional well-being, but it doesn’t necessarily ruin relationships or career performance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms to watch for include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irritability and anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty focusing or paying attention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling hyper-vigilant or stressed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life offline feels dull or uninteresting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/Screenshot_2025-11-02_200817_1762094328846.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="To address 'popcorn brain', Dr Sukul advises creating screen-free zones, taking breaks from devices, practising mindfulness, and consuming media intentionally.(Google Gemini)" title="To address 'popcorn brain', Dr Sukul advises creating screen-free zones, taking breaks from devices, practising mindfulness, and consuming media intentionally.(Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;To address 'popcorn brain', Dr Sukul advises creating screen-free zones, taking breaks from devices, practising mindfulness, and consuming media intentionally.(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to ease Popcorn Brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sukul suggests several strategies to reclaim focus and peace of mind:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Create screen-free zones:&lt;/strong&gt; Designate areas in your home where phones and devices aren’t allowed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Schedule device breaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Take intentional breaks from screens to reset your brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Practice mindfulness: &lt;/strong&gt;Meditation, yoga, and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/feeling-stressed-and-out-of-focus-yoga-expert-shares-3-breathing-exercises-to-calm-your-mind-101761059032005.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="breathing exercises"&gt;breathing exercises&lt;/a&gt; can help improve focus and calm overstimulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Work in focused bursts: &lt;/strong&gt;Short periods of concentration followed by breaks enhance productivity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Be intentional with media consumption: &lt;/strong&gt;Ask yourself, “Who is in control, me or my phone?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Avoid mindless scrolling: &lt;/strong&gt;Passive browsing actively overstimulates your brain and reinforces Popcorn Brain symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By consciously managing digital consumption and including mindfulness practices, you can reclaim your attention, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being,” Dr Sukul concludes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:24:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么萨古鲁推荐这3种食物来提高免疫力-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/why-sadhguru-recommends-these-3-foods-to-boost-immunity/photostory/125036109.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadhguru also recommends drinking water stored in copper bottles. As per his post, water stored in copper vessels can play a significant role in cleansing our system of various toxins. “Because water has memory, we are very concerned with how we store it. If you keep water in a copper vessel, preferably overnight or at least for four hours, the water acquires a certain quality from the copper which is very good for your liver in particular and your health and energy in general,” he states. The post also reads that copper is an antimicrobial and it kills bacteria and viruses, sometimes within minutes. According to a study, published in the &lt;a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1419/0850/files/Copper_Water_Vessel_Study_1.pdf?11079965153100211770"&gt;Journal of Health&lt;/a&gt;, Population and Nutrition, scientists studied the effect of storing water in a copper container on microbially contaminated drinking water, including harmful bacteria such as E.coli. and salmonella. Water contaminated with this bacterium was stored in copper containers for 16 hours at room temperature. Incredibly, after the 16-hour storage period, the scientists were unable to recover the bacteria from the water. In addition, they found that the pH level of the water increased, which means that it became naturally more alkaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Images Courtesy: istock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is meant for general knowledge only and should not be taken as medical advice.

Through in-depth interviews, researchers found that these experiences often begin in childhood, are felt as a deep, internal sensation, and can be integrated into a person’s sexual life. This work builds on more than a decade of research that challenges the common understanding of orgasm as a strictly sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted by a team at The Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University, led by Debby Herbenick, a prominent sexuality researcher. The scientific rationale for these studies stems from a desire to understand the full spectrum of human orgasmic response. Before this work began, the phenomenon was mostly a subject of popular curiosity, often called a “coregasm” in magazines and online forums because of its frequent association with abdominal workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While orgasm is almost exclusively discussed in sexual contexts, historical medical literature and early sexuality research, like the Kinsey reports, had occasionally noted orgasms occurring during non-sexual activities. However, these observations were limited, and a scientific gap remained between the popular buzz and empirical evidence. By systematically investigating this phenomenon, the researchers hoped to gain a clearer picture of the physiological and psychological processes of orgasm, independent of sexual fantasy or direct genital stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of inquiry began with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a foundational study&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. The researchers conducted an anonymous, internet-based survey of 530 women who had experienced either orgasm or sexual pleasure during exercise. The goal was to systematically describe a phenomenon that had, until then, been confined to popular media articles and scattered case reports. This initial study was exploratory, aiming to identify which exercises were most commonly associated with these experiences and what the experiences felt like for the women involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from that first survey established a baseline understanding. Among women who reported exercise-induced orgasms, the most common activities were abdominal exercises, climbing poles or ropes, and lifting weights. A large portion of these women reported feeling self-conscious about their experience, particularly when exercising in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that sexual thoughts or fantasies were rarely associated with these orgasms, suggesting the experience was primarily physiological rather than psychological in origin. For women who experienced sexual pleasure without orgasm, biking or spinning was frequently identified, along with abdominal exercises and weight lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to understand the prevalence of this phenomenon in the general population, the research team conducted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-01996-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; using data from the 2014 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior. This survey involved a nationally representative probability sample of over 2,000 U.S. adolescents and adults, allowing for a much broader and more generalizable analysis. This study was the first to provide population-level estimates for exercise-induced orgasm and included men in its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 study revealed that approximately 9% of the survey respondents reported having experienced an orgasm during exercise at least once in their lifetime. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence between men and women. The researchers did find a gender difference in the age of first experience, with women reporting a mean age of about 23, while men reported a mean age of about 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of exercises associated with the first experience were consistent with the 2011 findings and included abdominal exercises, climbing, and weight lifting for both genders. The analysis also identified an association between having an exercise-induced orgasm and having an orgasm during sleep, but not with having an orgasm during a recent partnered sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent study, published in 2025, moved from quantitative surveys to qualitative interviews to capture the rich, lived experiences of women. The research team conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 women, ranging in age from 19 to 68, who had a history of exercise-induced orgasms. The interviews took place in a setting equipped with exercise mats and a Roman chair, allowing participants to demonstrate, if they felt comfortable, the specific movements that led to their experiences. This method allowed for a detailed exploration of their personal histories, physical sensations, and emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding from these interviews was that the first experience with exercise-induced arousal or orgasm often occurred during childhood or early adolescence. Many women recalled feeling these sensations as young as five or six years old while climbing poles on a playground, doing gymnastics, or performing sit-ups in physical education class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, they were often confused by the sensations, with several participants describing the initial feeling as a sense that they needed to urinate. They lacked a framework for understanding what was happening to their bodies, but they recognized the feeling was pleasurable and, in some cases, sought to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants often described an “aha” moment, which typically occurred later in adolescence or adulthood, when they gained more sexual knowledge from peers, media, or their own sexual experiences. It was at this point they connected their childhood sensations with the concept of arousal and orgasm. One woman recounted how making out with someone for the first time made her realize, “This is the same feeling, how strange.” This moment of recognition helped them make sense of a long-standing, and sometimes bewildering, bodily experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interviews provided detailed descriptions of how an exercise-induced orgasm feels physically. Many women characterized it as a deep, internal sensation, originating in the lower abdomen between the belly button and the pelvis. They often contrasted this with orgasms from direct clitoral stimulation, which they described as more external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants noted a progression of sensations, starting with a warmth or tingling in their core that would build and radiate downward. The experience was often predictable, with women learning that orgasm would occur after a certain number of repetitions of an exercise, such as after 50 leg lifts or during the third set of pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional responses to these experiences were complex and often evolved over time. Embarrassment and shame were common, especially when the orgasms occurred in public spaces like a gym or during a group fitness class. Participants worried that others might notice their facial expressions or hear them make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some developed strategies to mask the experience, like keeping a serious facial expression, or to avoid it altogether by choosing different exercises. These feelings were sometimes rooted in cultural or familial taboos around sexuality, which made experiencing an orgasm in a non-sexual, public setting feel inappropriate or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these negative feelings, many women came to accept and even enjoy their ability to have orgasms through exercise. Some viewed it as a motivator to work out, an “added perk at the end of the 100 reps.” Others described it as an empowering experience that gave them a sense of control over their own pleasure, independent of a partner. One woman explained that if she was not getting the attention she needed from her husband, exercise was another way to achieve the stress release of an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant finding was how some women integrated their knowledge of exercise-induced orgasms into their sexual lives. After learning which muscle contractions produced pleasure during exercise, they were able to apply similar movements during partnered sex. One participant explained that she could tense her core muscles to achieve a stronger or faster orgasm, sometimes allowing her to climax at the same time as her partner. For some, exercise became a form of masturbation or foreplay, and for one woman, it was the only way she had been able to experience orgasm until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have some limitations. The initial survey used a convenience sample, which cannot be used to determine prevalence. The new qualitative study involved a small number of participants who were mostly young, white, and living in the United States, so their experiences may not reflect those of a more diverse population. Future research is needed to explore these experiences among men, gender-diverse individuals, people from different cultural backgrounds, and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major direction for future research is to understand the physiological mechanism behind exercise-induced orgasms. It is still not known precisely how muscle contractions during certain exercises trigger an orgasmic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies could involve biomechanical analysis, neuro-imaging, or other physiological measures to investigate the roles of muscle tension, nerve pathways, and the sympathetic nervous system. A better understanding of the mechanism could have practical applications for physical therapists, personal trainers, and even military personnel who must pass rigorous fitness tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exercise-induced orgasm and pleasure among women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Debby Herbenick and J.

'But while the stress reduced eventually, the weight didn't.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pauline knew her blood pressure was putting her at higher risk of stroke, heart attack and dementia. But it wasn't until decades later, after watching an episode of a healthy-eating series presented by Dr Michael Mosley, The Mail on Sunday columnist who passed away last year, that Pauline found the key to losing the extra pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Seeing him explain his high-protein, low-carb diet made me think that I could follow it,' says Pauline. 'And, alongside more regular exercise, the weight fell off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years in, Pauline, now 72, has lost 4st 8lb (30kg), does 140 squats a day, and has got her blood pressure in a normal range – all without medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It seems miraculous, but experts speaking to The Mail on Sunday say that anyone can – and should – fix their high blood pressure through simple lifestyle changes like Pauline's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke in the UK – impacting nearly 14 million adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;High blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke in the UK – impacting nearly 14 million adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professor David Webb, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Edinburgh, says losing some weight is an effective way to lower your blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is rising among young people as well – with nearly 170,000 16-24-year-olds estimated to be living undiagnosed. Also known as hypertension, the condition occurs when the pressure of blood pushing against the heart walls is consistently too high, damaging the arteries and restricting blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People of African and Caribbean descent, as well as those with a family history of the condition, are more likely to develop hypertension. But being overweight, smoking, not doing enough exercise and eating a diet high in salt can all also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, high blood pressure can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surprisingly, experts say the best way to tackle high blood pressure is not medical treatment but lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week, The Mail on Sunday's GP columnist Dr Ellie Cannon wrote that high blood pressure is the long-term health condition where she feels patients can make the most difference themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she asked readers to write in about their own attempts to lower their blood pressure at home – and was flooded with messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 63-year-old man said that eating a daily dose of 85 per cent dark chocolate, as well as more fruit, reduced his blood pressure without him needing to take any medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 56-year-old woman wrote that swapping to decaffeinated coffee brought her blood pressure down to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 72-year-old woman said that buying a mini trampoline was her key to reducing her blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I need to do is five minutes of exercise in the morning and five in the evening,' she explained. 'This can be either bouncing or jogging on the spot, but it has to be fairly energetic. I make sure I'm slightly out of breath before I finish. I was previously prescribed medication, but now I no longer need to take it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So here are the eight simple steps that experts say are scientifically proven to reverse your high blood pressure without drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;One teaspoon of salt a day... and no more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting out salt from your diet is the single most important thing you can do to lower your blood pressure, says Professor Francesco Cappuccio, a cardiology expert at the University of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Salt is made up of chloride and sodium – the latter of which we know impacts blood pressure,' he says. 'If you reduce your sodium intake, you reduce your blood pressure significantly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much sodium raises blood pressure by causing the body to retain excess water, which increases the blood's volume and puts pressure on artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most adults in the UK eat about 8g to 9g of salt a day – but the recommended limit is no more than 6g, or about one teaspoon in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Too much sodium raises blood pressure by causing the body to retain excess water, which increases the blood's volume and puts pressure on artery walls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing this amount can lower your blood pressure within just a few weeks, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the best way to lower intake is to stick to home-cooked food. This is because processed, ready-made foods, such as bread, sauces, soups and ready meals are the main source of added salt in our diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while it's good to limit your intake of processed foods, you don't have to go cold turkey, says Professor David Webb, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can retrain yourself by reducing the amount you add when cooking – though food might taste a little bland at first,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And don't add salt at the table, if you can avoid it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Shedding a few pounds makes a huge difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As was the case for Pauline, losing weight can be another key way to bring down blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being overweight or obese causes hypertension due to excess fat, forcing the heart to pump harder in order to supply blood to the body. That strains the heart and increases resistance in the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Likewise, says Prof Webb, sleep apnoea – a disorder often triggered by obesity in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly while in bed – can raise blood pressure significantly at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that losing even 5 to 10 per cent of body weight can lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But waist size is key: for men, their waist circumference should measure less than 37in (94cm), while for women, waist size should not exceed 31.5in (80cm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb said: 'If you can lose even a little weight, this can help lower blood pressure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Skip the lift and take the stairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as helping you lose weight, research suggests that regular aerobic exercise – physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates – can have a direct effect on blood pressure. NHS guidelines advise patients with high blood pressure to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week – which includes anything from brisk walking to trampolining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one of the most effective ways to get some cardio into your day could just be taking the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS guidelines advise patients with high blood pressure to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week - and taking the stairs can help achieve that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study from researchers in China found that climbing five flights of stairs a day reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and blood clots by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Climbing up stairs is brilliant for blood pressure,' says Prof Webb. 'The more breathless and sweaty you get, the better.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While aerobic exercise raises your blood pressure in the short term, it has long-term benefits for your heart. 'It controls the heart rate, keeps muscles healthy and is generally a very good thing to do for your health,' says Professor Cappuccio. 'And it's a good preventative strategy to delay the rise in blood pressure that happens naturally with age, even if you don't yet have hypertension.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Daily squats could be the answe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strength training is just as crucial as aerobic exercise in lowering hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could involve lifting weights or using resistance bands, or doing bodyweight exercises such as push-ups or wall-sits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while Pauline likes squats, others may prefer to plank – an abdominal exercise that involves holding a position similar to a push-up without bending the arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As well as helping to tone your glutes, regular squats can lower hypertension and thus lower blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 80-something Tony Gregory, it was a 30-second plank every morning that brought down his blood pressure. 'I had read about over 100 clinical trials that involved about 100,000 participants that showed doing the plank was especially effective in helping to control blood pressure – and this certainly appears to be working for me!' he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb adds: 'It's not exactly clear why any of these exercises are so good for blood pressure, but we think it's likely because they improve cardiac efficiency and reduce resistance in blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They can change the way the heart and blood vessels work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those looking to lower their blood pressure, Prof Webb advises weight training three times a week (even if only for 10-15 minutes) alongside aerobic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Eat more bananas and lentils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating more bananas may also help lower blood pressure. The fruit is packed with potassium, a mineral which helps the body balance sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other great sources of potassium include kiwi fruit, potatoes, beans, lentils, leafy greens, yogurt, avocado and salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't eat enough potassium in our diets – particularly as there's hardly any of the nutrient in processed foods,' says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts warn patients to be wary of over-supplementing the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults aged 19 to 64 only need about 3,500mg of potassium a day – though the American Heart Foundation recommends up to 5,000mg a day for managing high blood pressure. Regularly exceeding this amount can damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Swap a glass of orange for... beet juice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glass of bright red beet juice may seem an odd cure for hypertension. But recent studies show beets – or their juice – can help lower blood pressure due to their high content of inorganic nitrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When consumed, whether eating or drinking it, this nitrate is converted into nitric oxide, a compound shown to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from scientists at the University of Exeter found that a glass of beetroot juice twice a day significantly lowered blood pressure in adults aged 67 to 79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Beet juice contains nitrates and antioxidants that can lower blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek Peel, 75, told us: 'I suffered on and off with high blood pressure until I discovered beetroot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I take a large glass of warm water with a squeeze of lemon juice and a teaspoon of beetroot powder mixed in every morning. Some days I might take a beetroot tablet as well – it really does work and I don't take any medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb says: 'There's definitely evidence that beetroot does lower blood pressure, but we need more research into it. It's certainly not an alternative to exercise or cutting down on salt, but might be something to take alongside.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Ditch booze - one pint could put you at risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has been proven to raise blood pressure – even in moderate amounts, says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies have shown that the morning after binge drinking, there's an increase in stroke rates as the body's blood pressure is surging,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But even regular light to moderate drinking will have a sustained effect in terms of lifetime risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol raises blood pressure, in the short and long-term, by stimulating the nervous system, which raises heart rate and narrows blood vessels. Regularly drinking more than the recommended limits can also cause lasting high blood pressure by limiting the brain's ability to regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sustained high pressure can strain the heart muscle and damage blood vessel walls, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study, spanning several decades and including 20,000 people, suggests that blood pressure increases in line with alcohol consumption, starting from as little as one glass of wine per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To limit damage, don't drink more than 14 units – not drinks – of alcohol a week, and spread this over several days, to give the body a chance to recover, NHS guidelines say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Try to get six to eight hours' sleep each night &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep is crucial to health – and blood pressure is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an environmental factor that has been neglected for many years, but lots of studies in recent years have shown the importance of good sleep for blood pressure,' says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The chance of developing high blood pressure is two to three times higher for sleep-deprived people. Whereas if you sleep for longer, research shows that your blood pressure will go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sleep also has a massive effect on weight gain, which in turn affects blood pressure. We should really all be making an effort to sleep for at least six to eight hours a night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To do this, he says: 'Make sure your bedroom is a place to sleep – not live. Dim the lights, get rid of any screens, keep it at a cosy temperature and read a nice book.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;I ran back to health in memory of my mum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bradley Pike had never been particularly healthy. But after his mum died from a heart condition in 2023, the dad-of-three began to slip into even worse habits than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started drinking and smoking loads, as a way to deal with the grief,' the 31-year-old, pictured left, says. 'I felt ill all the time and was having dizzy spells a lot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bradley went to his GP, who ran tests that revealed he was prediabetic and had worryingly high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bradley Pike lowered his blood pressure through running and lost 2.5st in the process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were reluctant to put me on drugs, because I'd need to be on them for life and I was so young,' he explains. 'But they told me I needed to change my lifestyle.' Luckily for Bradley, the route back to health dropped into his lap a few weeks later. He was offered a place in the London Marathon by the British Heart Foundation in memory of his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, training was incredibly difficult, due to his weight and blood pressure. But he stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In three months, he lost 2.5st (15kg) and brought his blood pressure down to normal levels. He has since run two more marathons and completed a 62-mile (100km) ultramarathon across the Gower Peninsula. 'I look back at my life before and barely recognise myself,' he says. 'There's so much you can do to turn your health around. All you have to do is start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 14:54:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQb1VTTGFQVFk4MkhBb0IxVEU5LU4zRUpNcXQzWVVEWEZCZFhOYWY2dTZoTE5CM21zZ3hSQnNRMDdiYTREMzhIcVpxckdONGV5b0FtNS0tN3F1VEl2NEdRcWpYYlBkb1VRUDJNMktFbDc3S3NDeDI5U0YyQ0hkVGktNXRKenpQMlRMb3E0WEozLWQ</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织警告全球“分支Ib” Mpox病例上升：我们应该注意的5种症状-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/who-warns-of-rising-clade-ib-mpox-cases-worldwide-5-symptoms-we-should-watch-out-for/photostory/125035635.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Early recognition helps stop the spread.

It's taken by many in the hopes of boosting strength, enhancing athletic performance, and promoting muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it isn't only adults who are using this supplement. A growing number of teenagers and young adults report &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a68812063/should-teenagers-take-creatine/"&gt;taking creatine&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of reaping the supplement's benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6611041/"&gt;72% of male athletes&lt;/a&gt; aged 17-18 report using creatine. Use is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-5-2"&gt;more common among athletes&lt;/a&gt;, especially young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pomegranates-could-limit-risks-from-controversial-sports-supplement"&gt;Pomegranates Could Limit Risks From Controversial Sports Supplement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While creatine is generally considered to be safe for young people to use, it's no shortcut to getting fit. It's better for young people looking to get strong or improve their athletic performance to focus on the fundamentals: exercising, eating properly, and prioritising sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;natural compound&lt;/a&gt; stored within muscle. Although a small amount is produced in the kidneys and liver, most (around 95%) is obtained from eating meat and seafood. Creatine plays an important role in providing energy during high-intensity activities, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;sprinting and lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg" alt="man with dumbells" class="wp-image-179717 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Creatine provides extra energy to muscles for high-intensity activities. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9JJETQoI/"&gt;DorianGray/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several forms of creatine are commercially available, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;creatine monohydrate&lt;/a&gt; is the most stable and extensively studied form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies show that creatine supplementation enhances performance in high-intensity exercises requiring strength and power, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and sprinting. Creatine supplementation may also lead to more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061915"&gt;faster recovery&lt;/a&gt; from exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research also suggests that creatine's benefits extend beyond the gym. Studies indicate that creatine may improve aspects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; – specifically memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2015.12.034"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt; for older adults in preventing muscle loss and protecting against neurological disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine's safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical diet that includes meat and seafood provides around &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;1–2 grams of creatine&lt;/a&gt; per day, which keeps the muscles around 60–80% full of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a daily creatine supplement eventually fills the muscles with creatine. There are two common ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quickest and most commonly studied method involves a one-week loading phase. This entails taking 0.3 grams of creatine per kilogram of body weight four times a day. For example, a 75kg person would take a total of 24g of creatine per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z/"&gt;alternative approach&lt;/a&gt;, which increases muscle creatine levels more gradually, is to take 3g of creatine per day for around 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both approaches will fill muscle creatine stores. The first (loading) approach tops up creatine stores faster, which means you'll see benefits to exercise performance faster. However, the second approach is less likely to cause temporary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; (such as bloating and diarrhoea) which are more common when using the loading approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what approach you use, taking 3- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; of creatine daily is necessary to maintain muscle creatine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;Numerous studies show&lt;/a&gt; that short and long-term creatine supplementation (up to 30g a day for five years) is safe and has no ill effects on health when taken at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;recommended dosages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effect of creatine is weight gain as the supplement &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00157.2007"&gt;increases water retention&lt;/a&gt; in muscles. This extra water remains only as long as you're taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine and young people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is shown to be safe and effective for adults, only a few studies have investigated the effects among children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available studies show that creatine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2018.00115"&gt;appears to be safe&lt;/a&gt; for young people to use and can provide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020664"&gt;performance benefits&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for athletes. Most studies have only looked at the safety of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0162-2"&gt;creatine dosage&lt;/a&gt; between 0.1g and 0.3g per kg of body mass per day. As such, it's important that any young people who choose to use creatine do not exceed this dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine appears to be safe for children and adolescents to take, it is possible that, without proper nutrition education and supervision of dosing, they could be at risk of misusing creatine – potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg" alt="man with stomach cramps" class="wp-image-179721 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stomach cramps can be an adverse effect of misusing creatine. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEpfy0r27A/"&gt;SHOTPRIME/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study that evaluated young athletes' understanding of how sports supplements &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0294-7"&gt;should be used&lt;/a&gt; reported that only 11% of the athletes answered questions correctly about creatine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, it's important to recognise that supplements such as creatine are not a shortcut to improving fitness, building muscle, or losing body fat. Supplements provide much &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1663860"&gt;smaller performance gains&lt;/a&gt; compared to what can be achieved through good training and nutrition alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sports supplements support training and recovery, significant progress comes from consistent exercise, a balanced diet, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00564"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a well-designed training programme and healthy eating plan, young people will experience rapid improvements in strength, power, and endurance without the need for supplements. Focusing too soon on taking supplements could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/her/18.1.98"&gt;distract young people&lt;/a&gt; from building good training habits and healthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why most sport nutritionists recommend using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0335"&gt;food-first approach&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on maximising diet quality before recommending supplements such as creatine.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267365/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/paul-hough-2282013"&gt;Paul Hough&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer Sport &amp;amp; Exercise Physiology , &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-westminster-916"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The link traces back to food handling practices in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to determine whether some UTIs occur due to factors other than hygiene or dehydration, as the bacteria that cause them are commonly associated with the gut and enter the urethra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research found that 18 per cent of UTIs were linked to E. coli strains that originated from animals used for meat production. 1 in 5 UTI-causing bacteria was identified on the basis of genetics as the bacteria found in meat. This means that some cases of UTI can also come from meat, not just the body's bacteria. The highest contamination levels, around 36 to 38 per cent, were found in meats like chicken and turkey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study found that people residing in low-income areas had a 60 per cent higher chance of contracting a UTI from food-borne bacteria. The reasons suggest inadequate access to refrigeration, poor kitchen sanitation, or improper cooking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/chopping_1762089259420.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="If you are using a common chopping board to cut raw meat, make sure you wash it well before using it again.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This means how you cook and handle the meat is very critical and should not be taken lightly. Here, the kitchen proved to be an unexpected source, as it's where all food handling takes place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If raw meat carrying E. coli is not handled safely and correct hygiene is not maintained, there is a chance of the bacteria spreading. For example, not washing food properly or failing to clean the cutting board and chopping vegetables on it.

As the evenings close in and the mornings grow murky, energy ebbs and a heavy sadness settles in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although seasonal affective disorder (Sad) was only formally recognised by psychiatrists in the 1980s, the link between the seasons, mood and vitality has long been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine – a Chinese text from roughly 300BC – described how the seasons affect all living things. It advised that in winter, one should “retire early and get up with the sunrise”, keeping “desires and mental activity quiet and subdued, as if keeping a happy secret”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Today, scientists are rediscovering how closely tuned our biology is to the seasons. According to Dr Cathy Wyse, a chancellor’s research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, the biggest advance over the past decade “has been the realisation that seasonal changes in human mood are probably endogenous – that they’re part of our physiology”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Large-scale resources such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/18/uk-biobank-is-safely-sharing-health-data-to-drive-medical-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; have transformed this area of research, allowing scientists to track seasonal patterns across hundreds of thousands of people over many years – something that was previously impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, where to draw the line between normal winter sluggishness and clinical depression is not straightforward. Sad is recognised as a subtype of major depression or bipolar disorder, defined by its predictable seasonal pattern: symptoms typically begin in autumn or winter and lift in spring. Alongside typical signs of depression, people often sleep longer, feel lethargic and want to eat more, particularly carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The triggers of these changes are still being investigated, but they are almost certainly linked to reduced daylight. Light is the key regulator of our internal body or circadian clock, influencing the timing of hormone release, alertness and mood. Without sufficient daylight – especially when combined with too much artificial light in the evenings – these rhythms can drift out of sync with the external world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4bd39955-f577-4324-88ab-06658bf4a4f5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Amish people in the US, who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to artificial light at night, have some of the lowest Sad rates among Caucasian populations.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some people may be more sensitive to this shift than others. Wyse and her colleagues are studying seasonal effects in &lt;a href="https://www.heliosbd.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, where manic episodes often peak in spring and depression tends to be more common in the darker months. “We suspect that people with bipolar disorder may be very sensitive to light and seasonal cues, and that’s triggering their symptoms,” said Wyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even among those without clinical depression, many people experience a milder seasonal dip in mood, known as subsyndromal Sad or “the winter blues”. In the UK, an estimated one in five people are affected, though only about 2% experience full Sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet, seasonal biology extends far beyond mood. Researchers have found fluctuations in the expression of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 4,000 protein-coding genes&lt;/a&gt; in white blood cells and fat, along with changes in the cellular composition of blood itself across the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wyse and her colleagues recently analysed four years of UK Biobank sleep data from half a million people. “We found that in winter, people tended to sleep longer and had increased sleeplessness – their sleep wasn’t so good as in the summer,” said Wyse, who will present these findings at the British Sleep Society conference in Brighton next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However natural these seasonal changes may be, society still expects people to carry on as normal. Few of us can hibernate, however tempting that may sound. The most effective antidote to the winter slump is light. Bright light therapy remains the gold standard for treating Sad, though timing and dosage are critical (see below). For those unable to manage a daily session in front of a light box, natural sunlight is a powerful substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="aae49198-892e-44fa-813c-7151b7917e50" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Early morning light is especially powerful in resetting the circadian clock.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Rebecca Cole/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of Amish communities in the US – who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to bright artificial light at night – show some of the lowest Sad rates recorded among Caucasian populations. By contrast, the prevalence in New York is about 4.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exposure to bright, natural light early in the day helps to synchronise the circadian clock and suppress lingering melatonin, a night-time hormone that may make a person feel groggy. Light also has a direct alerting effect: one study found that an hour of blue-enriched light boosted reaction times more than the equivalent of two cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But light isn’t the whole story. Cognitive behavioural therapy tailored for Sad can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859764/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;as effective as light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, helping people reframe their relationship with winter rather than just manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Winter will come regardless. By shifting how we think about it, we can reclaim some joy from the darker months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-beat-the-winter-blues" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;How to beat the winter blues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;footer class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek the morning sun: &lt;/strong&gt;Even on grey days, step outside as early as possible. Daylight resets your circadian clock, improves alertness and suppresses melatonin. Early morning light is especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a light box: &lt;/strong&gt;Brightness levels are measured in lux. A typical Sad lamp will emit light at about 10,000 lux – 20 to 40 times brighter than typical office lighting, and roughly equivalent to outdoor light on an overcast summer’s day. Sit in front of it for 20–30 minutes soon after waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your sleep habits: &lt;/strong&gt;Stick to regular sleep and wake times, avoid screens late at night and keep evening lighting warm and dim. This helps prevent your internal rhythms from drifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outside – properly:&lt;/strong&gt; Even on a cloudy day in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January, outdoor light is roughly 10 times brighter than indoors. Aim for at least an hour a day, ideally combining it with something enjoyable: a walk, a coffee in the park or a kick-about with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan winter pleasures: &lt;/strong&gt;Reframe thoughts such as “I hate winter” into “winter is harder, but I can plan around it”. Embrace cosy rituals, such as candles, hot chocolate or warm baths and schedule social or outdoor activities, such as cold-water dips or winter hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help: &lt;/strong&gt;If mood, sleep or motivation problems persist for weeks or interfere with daily life, speak to a GP or mental health professional. Sad is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, the more limited cognitive challenges found in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who do not have learning difficulties may be consequences of their inattention and hyperactivity. The research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD and those with specific learning difficulties often exhibit overlapping challenges with attention and certain thinking skills. This has led researchers to question the nature of this relationship: Are the difficulties with memory and processing simply a side effect of being inattentive or hyperactive? A team of researchers sought to disentangle these factors to better understand the underlying cognitive profiles of these distinct but frequently co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there have been previous studies that examined the link between ADHD symptoms and learning or cognitive skills in groups of children with ADHD or learning difficulties, there has been no study that examined how ADHD symptoms influence cognitive skills that are key to learning in these neurodivergent groups,” said study author Yufei Cai, a PhD researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how ADHD attentional behaviors influence these cognitive skills that are essential for successful learning in these neurodivergent populations can offer suggestions for designing interventions that might improve cognitive or learning functioning in these neurodivergent groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers performed a detailed analysis of existing data from the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory, a large cohort of children referred for concerns related to attention, memory, or learning. They selected data from 770 children, aged 5 to 18, and organized them into four distinct groups. These groups included children with a diagnosis of ADHD only, children with learning difficulties only, children with both ADHD and learning difficulties, and a comparison group of children with no known neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each child had completed a broad range of standardized tests. These assessments measured fundamental cognitive skills such as verbal and visuospatial short-term memory, working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily), processing speed, and sustained attention. Higher-level executive functions, like the ability to flexibly shift between different tasks or rules, were also evaluated. Alongside these direct assessments, parents provided ratings of their child’s daily behaviors related to inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first to date that has (1) a relatively large neurodivergent sample size, (2) a comprehensive battery of cognitive and learning measures, and (3) the inclusion of a co-occurring condition group of those with both ADHD and learning difficulties to examine the extent to which elevated scores of ADHD symptoms can account for the group differences in cognitive skills that are key to learning between these neurodivergent and comparison groups,” Cai told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study aims to characterize the cognitive profiles of these three neurodivergent groups, as well as examine the associations between ADHD symptoms (i.e., inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors) and cognitive skills that are key to learning in children with ADHD, learning difficulties, and those with both conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the analysis involved a two-step comparison. First, the researchers compared the performance of the four groups across all the cognitive tests to identify where differences existed. Next, they applied a statistical approach to see what would happen to these differences if they mathematically adjusted for each child’s level of parent-rated inattention and hyperactivity. If a group’s cognitive weakness disappeared after this adjustment, it would suggest the cognitive issue might be a consequence of attentional behaviors. If the weakness remained, it would point to a more fundamental cognitive deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a clear divergence between the groups. Children with learning difficulties, both with and without a co-occurring ADHD diagnosis, displayed a broad pattern of lower performance across many cognitive domains. They showed weaknesses in short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, sustained attention, and the ability to sequence information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers statistically accounted for levels of inattention and hyperactivity, these cognitive deficits largely persisted. This outcome suggests that for children with learning difficulties, these cognitive challenges are likely foundational to their condition, not just a byproduct of attentional issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profile for children with ADHD only was quite different. This group performed at age-appropriate levels on many of the cognitive tasks, including verbal short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, and sustained attention. They did show some specific difficulties, particularly in visuospatial short-term memory and the ability to quickly sequence numbers or letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these particular challenges were no longer apparent after the statistical analysis adjusted for their levels of inattention and hyperactivity. This finding indicates that for these children, their attentional behaviors may directly interfere with performance on certain cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific challenge did appear to be independent of attentional behaviors for the ADHD only group. Their difficulty with set shifting, or mentally switching between different task rules, remained even after accounting for inattention and hyperactivity. This points to a more specific executive function challenge in ADHD that may not be fully explained by its primary behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings paint a picture of two different neurodevelopmental pathways. For children with learning difficulties, core cognitive weaknesses appear to drive their academic struggles. For many children with ADHD alone, their primary attentional challenges may be what creates more limited and specific hurdles in their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children with learning difficulties, either with or without ADHD, had lower levels of cognitive skills than children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties and those in the comparison group,” Cai explained. “Elevated levels of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors did not influence the low cognitive performance observed in these children. Instead, this lower cognitive performance may be more closely associated with their learning ability, which is central to their neurodevelopmental characteristics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these attentional behaviors are closely linked to the more limited cognitive challenges observed in children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties. Understanding whether neurodivergent children with ADHD, learning difficulties, or both experience cognitive or learning-related challenges provides a valuable framework for designing targeted intervention and support strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, the study includes some limitations. The group with learning difficulties was identified based on low scores on academic tests rather than formal clinical diagnoses of conditions like dyslexia or dyscalculia, which might not be perfectly equivalent. The study’s design provides a snapshot at a single point in time, so it cannot capture how these relationships might evolve as children develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by following children over several years to observe these developmental trajectories directly. Incorporating a wider array of cognitive measures and gathering behavioral information from multiple sources, including teachers, could also help create an even more detailed understanding. Such work could help refine support strategies, ensuring that interventions are targeted to a child’s specific profile of cognitive and behavioral needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Associations Between ADHD Symptom Dimensions and Cognition in Children With ADHD and Learning Difficulties&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yufei Cai, Joni Holmes, and Susan E.

&lt;p&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days. But if you’re reaching for a bottle of multivitamins right to supplement the gaps, you may want to slow your roll, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietician nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.mpmnutrition.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Marissa Karp&lt;/a&gt; had this advice: “While supplements can help us bridge the gap and serve as an insurance policy, they aren’t a replacement for eating nourishing foods. If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: “When you eat an avocado, it’s not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together. It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shortfall-nutrients_l_67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It became the first fully synthetic molecule to be considered a drug after scientists discovered it could be used to treat some diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most famously, the German immunologist Paul Ehrlich experimented with methylene blue and found that it could treat malaria in sailors. Ehrlich coined the concept of the “magic bullet” — the idea that if you could find a chemical that binds to a certain bacteria or virus but not the rest of the tissue, it could help target diseases. He went on to do notable work in syphilis and chemotherapy, and his career was documented and dramatized in the 1940 film, “Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet,” starring Edward G. Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is absolutely the history of methylene blue,” said Gordon Lithgow of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, who studies molecules that extend lifespan. “That (magic bullet) principle still drives pharmacology culture today. We’re looking for specific agents that bind to one thing and don’t affect other stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, methylene blue has been used as a staining compound in labs because it helps visualize the presence of certain materials in cells and track their rate of movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, methylene blue is FDA-approved to treat just one medical condition, methemoglobinemia, a rare disorder that affects how red blood cells function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the hype began&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it go from a dye and staining compound to a buzzed-about anti-aging supplement? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear, but a few things have happened recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Nir Barzilai, a well-known longevity researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who studies centenarians, &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2024/03/11/evaluating-possible-anti-aging-drugs" data-link="native" class=""&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/5138/99193547794" data-link="native" class=""&gt;ranking&lt;/a&gt; of 12 FDA-approved drugs that he and his research team consider worth studying for anti-aging potential, based on pre-clinical and clinical studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top four drugs are SLGT2 inhibitors (a Type 2 diabetes drug), metformin (also a diabetes drug), biphosphonates (which treat osteoporosis and some cancers) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (which treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic). Lower down on the list is methylene blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Mel Gibson did an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast during which he said methylene blue and the antiparasitic ivermectin helped cure three of his friends’ cancer — remarks that were countered by medical experts for lack of scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a video of RFK Jr., putting blue drops into a glass of water went viral on X. Many speculated it was methylene blue, though that was not confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Bryan Johnson, a biohacker who injected plasma from his son as part of an anti-aging regimen, tweeted that &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1896679614602482042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1896679614602482042%7Ctwgr%5E05afb6eaa33ba75e55b3e1d1a2737cf026231733%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Fbryan-johnson-mel-gibson-possibly-200842038.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;he was starting methylene blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, there’s been a surge of social media chatter about methylene blue, with many people posting Instagram and TikTok videos of their blue tongues — methylene blue can temporarily turn your tongue and urine blue — and saying it helps with mood, focus, energy and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mitochondria connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason methylene blue is being explored as a potential anti-aging compound is because of its connection to mitochondrial function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are part of the cell that produces energy. Loss of mitochondrial function, due to oxidative stress increasing over time, is a hallmark of aging, said Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics at Stanford who researches longevity. Methylene blue has antioxidant properties that can help lower oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mitochondrial dysfunction get a lot of fatigue, he said, and loss of mitochondrial function has been observed in many diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8699482/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies on the anti-aging potential of methylene blue found that low doses of the compound improved oxidative stress, cognitive defects and memory in mice. It may also help with skin aging by stimulating elastin and collagen and promoting wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science still lacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers say the science is a ways away from being able to recommend methylene blue for off-label use, as there haven’t been enough studies in humans to determine its long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ready to take it myself,” Snyder said. “I don’t know anything about the long-term effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way longevity drugs tend to get developed, he said, is that researchers start with a drug that’s already been proven to be effective at treating specific conditions, like metformin or GLP-1 drugs. As studies continue, they find there are other benefits, such as weight loss. Metformin, for instance, has been widely prescribed for diabetes for decades, but researchers more recently found that it also has antioxidant properties, which could make it useful as a longevity drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely used and we know a lot about it and the side effects,” Snyder said of metformin. “I don’t know that you can say the same for methylene blue just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithgow, of the Buck Institute, cautioned people to “be really careful, especially when using synthetic molecules to affect something in your body without appropriate supervision. Hopefully those who are thinking about using it are getting good advice from their physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 12:22:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOdGR0dGlXTzFvb1pmQUlucElzSTAzbmp3TG5hUHpMRjRzUnFVZ0pZYlRpUHZaTmdyczJCRnNndWltZTNaMkJMNUdySElVRkpmUE1HRUpKUXctQ3hPUm5vb3RoMFJ0T0NaTksxUUZfaTBaeXh1VzVqeEJFTTVlbkVKVFhmZWdOTEN0RWlySmIzTFdlWHRUdGVZTHd2dy1hdw</guid></item><item><title>中年人：我害怕我会像妈妈一样得老年痴呆症-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/the-midults-im-worried-im-going-to-get-alzheimers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Dear A &amp;amp; E,&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 92-year-old mother was &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/caring-for-parent-with-alzheimers/"&gt;diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and I’ve had a ringside seat to the tragedy of this &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/19/lost-both-parents-dementia/"&gt;dynamic woman’s deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. She is now in a home and no longer recognises me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve convinced myself that her horrible fate will also be mine, and it scares me witless. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/alzheimer-early-onset-brain-fog-symptoms-test-dementia/"&gt;I’m 67 and in very good general health&lt;/a&gt;. My husband advises me not to spoil the next 15 years by worrying about something I can’t control, but I’m struggling to get on top of these terrifying thoughts. Should I stop visiting my mother in the hope that it will be a case of “out of sight, out of mind”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Fearful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Dear Fearful,&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly complicated stuff – medically, societally and emotionally. Everything about it demands the exact opposite of one-size-fits-all advice, and everything about it changes every day. So how could you ever possibly find your feet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We connect with this wholeheartedly. We have good friends – close friends – who are going through different but similar iterations of your situation: all struck with horror at the deterioration of their parent, but also engulfed by the admin and the duty, notwithstanding the strain of being in a relationship with someone who no longer seems themself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, humbled by your trust in us, we spoke to two titans on your behalf: Simon Wheeler, senior knowledge officer at the Alzheimer’s Society, and regular contributor to this column Mandy Saligari, therapist, founder of Charter Harley Street and author of &lt;em&gt;Proactive Parenting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please remember that you are not alone out there, feeling these big, horrible feelings. Wheeler tells us that it is “very common for adult children of someone with dementia to worry about developing the condition when they get older”, and the Alzheimer’s Society (&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/"&gt;alzheimers.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;) has a wealth of resources if you’ve not already landed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your worries about your own future, Wheeler adds that “research suggests that some of the risk can be reduced by staying as well as possible in other ways – such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/09/the-13-dementia-risk-factors-and-what-to-do-about-them/"&gt;not smoking, not drinking too much alcohol and staying physically, mentally and socially active&lt;/a&gt;”. Like everything about this punishing problem, the solutions, however imperfect, come back to basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that anything about this brutal crisis is simple. Saligari acknowledges that the mini-traumas of your situation hook deep. She says: “Children will feel shame on behalf of their parents, knowing that they would be horrified at their own behaviour – as if the child is upholding the parental standard even during the deterioration.” This feeling of shame may be part of what explains your reluctance to visit your mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than avoiding these feelings, Saligari says that accepting the consequences of an illness such as Alzheimer’s or dementia is really important. Wheeler supports this, suggesting close conversations with the staff at your mother’s care home so that you gain more insight into what makes her happy or peaceful. This will help you build a better picture of the woman she is now, rather than just grieving the woman she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cruelty of the disease is that you feel as if you’re losing someone while they’re still alive – and Saligari says this is especially difficult if you aren’t close: “You begin to realise that the relationship you (even unconsciously) hoped might one day be resolved is disappearing in front of your eyes.” This “will bring feelings of grief that need to be felt and accepted as you go along”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for not visiting your mother to cauterise your despair about your own future? In our experience with problems, big or small, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/11008905/Older-people-are-more-scared-of-dementia-than-cancer-poll-finds.html"&gt;out of sight, out of mind doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt;. It merely makes them worse – festering into a demon barely concealed in your emotional shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Saligari, decisions like that “can bring about a profound sense of regret and guilt after the parent has died”. Instead, she advises that “it’s important to stay with the reality – visit the parent as often as feels appropriate for you, and try to deal with the feelings as you go along, so that you stay up to speed with the reality of your situation, your mother and your own life”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for how to deal with your worries – be kind to yourself, dear Fearful. You are going to have good and bad days. Let’s face it, if worrying cured us, we’d all be entirely immunised and protected from every single thing that could possibly go wrong. By worrying, you’re simply bringing tomorrow’s pain into today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all this piercing panic, Saligari offers a little solace: “Any of the feelings that we have about our parents that come up at different stages are clues back to ourselves. It’s not a minefield, it’s a treasure hunt. So try to embrace this opportunity with curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be hard to hear right now, dear Fearful, but stay with it and be gentle with yourself, one day at a time. Like in the bear hunt – you can’t get over it, you can’t go under it – you’re just going to have to go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
