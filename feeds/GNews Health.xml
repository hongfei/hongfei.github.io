The owner of Reichardt Duck Farm, which sits in the rolling hills between Petaluma and the Two Rock area, confirmed that his facility recently recorded positive cases of the dreaded virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;added to its public database&lt;/a&gt; a second incidence of the highly virulent avian flu in Sonoma County, this one at an egg farm. The Press Democrat was unable to immediately confirm the location of that outbreak, which resulted in the deaths of 231,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing is a wake-up call. Two winters ago, when Sonoma County poultry farms were &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/01/12/sonoma-county-poultry-farmers-euthanize-thousands-more-birds-as-avian-flu-losses-devastate-local-industry/"&gt;ravaged by the spread of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the first case didn’t hit until around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak is another blow to the Reichardt family. Their Middle Two Rock Road farm was also heavily affected in 2023-24, when it was &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/01/250000-birds-to-be-killed-at-2-petaluma-poultry-farms-after-avian-flu-detected-2/"&gt;the first of multiple local facilities &lt;/a&gt;infected by the deadly and highly virulent avian flu virus, which typically requires producers to destroy all of their birds on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu outbreaks hit flocks at nine other chicken, duck and egg-laying facilities in the county that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Reichardt paused to talk to a reporter &lt;span&gt;Tuesday &lt;/span&gt;as his farm staff went about euthanizing 57,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at the last six years now, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/03/activism-prospective-ballot-fight-heighten-drama-of-sonoma-county-bird-flu-outbreak/"&gt;the DxE (animal liberation) raid&lt;/a&gt;, COVID, bird flu in ’23, now bird flu again in ’25. My older sister passed in 2020,” he said. “It’s been hit after hit. We’re looking for our fate to change at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt Duck Farm is not to be confused with Liberty Ducks, a smaller Sonoma County&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;producer, owned by members of the same family but operating at a separate location.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak was detected after Reichardt Duck Farm staff noticed “a modest increase in mortality” — eight dead birds — in one of the barns last week, Phil Reichardt said. The next morning, there were a few more than that. They took a sample of birds to UC Davis for analysis, and received confirmation of Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu, or HPAI, on Oct. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm began “depopulating” its flock Sunday, borrowing some machinery from Weber Family Farms, an egg facility that also was forced to put birds to death in 2023-24. Phil Reichardt expected to finish the grim task Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a departure from two years ago, when local ranchers knew much less about the spread of the pathogen and how best to block it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that previous round, Reichardt said, the farm received instructions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture the day before Thanksgiving. Because of the holiday, and a lower sense of urgency, they didn’t begin depopulating for six days. This time, Reichardt expected to be done five days after confirmation, which he hoped would reduce the chances of the flu hopping to another facility.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“The industry, unfortunately, is getting very good at this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report Thursday of another outbreak in one of the region’s bird farms demonstrates the limitations of that quick action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo Gallardo, professor of poultry medicine at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and an expert in poultry RNA viruses, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely a concerted effort,” Gallardo said. “The California Department of Food and Agriculture usually helps with this, the USDA usually helps. We’re all at high alert. We’re approaching winter. And we have learned a lot of things about biosecurity and prevention. The hope is that we will reduce dissemination after one detection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations on biosecurity measures haven’t changed based on the new appearance of HPAI, said Sue Ostrom, Sonoma County’s assistant agricultural commissioner, because — as Reichardt alluded — producers have gotten the work pretty buttoned down since their unprecedented local losses in the winter season two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that led to,” Ostrom said, “is that producers understand what needs to happen. How we dispose of carcasses, bedding and so forth. They can get to that faster now.”&lt;/p&gt;

The farm had to destroy 550,000 chickens and 3.2 million eggs after an avian flu outbreak. (Christopher Chung / The Press Democrat)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="icon-enlarge mng-gallery-fullscreen-expand" aria-label="Expand fullscreen slideshow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strain of bird flu detected in recent tests at Reichardt Duck Farm is the same as the one that swept Sonoma County two years ago, resulting in the &lt;span&gt;destruction of 1.2 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any real smoking gun,” Reichardt said. “We can only expect it was migratory birds flying overhead. We step into their droppings and enter the barns. We have foot pans in place, and we are careful to use them. But I guess we can’t hit everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like viruses transmitted among humans, HPAI tends to peak during the cold winter months. It generally spreads from migrating waterfowl to domesticated flocks along the major north-south flyways, including the Pacific Flyway that travels above Sonoma County. Researchers estimate 1 billion birds fly south along the Pacific Flyway each fall, and north again in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s normal, in a certain sense, to think cases will go up in the winter,” Gallardo said. “Usually, respiratory infections in chickens are related to changes in temperature and humidity. With birds migrating south, we’re right at a time when this might happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Reichardt Duck Farm was obligated to put down all of its birds, the business is not without prospects. Phil Reichardt estimated they have about 15,000 eggs currently incubating, and another 20,000-30,000 that are eligible to take that step soon. Those eggs must be moved off the property to raise elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an expensive process when no revenue is coming in,” Reichardt said. “But it’s all we know how to do. So we keep going even when it feels like we’re battering our heads against a brick wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/21/why-local-poultry-farmers-say-10-million-bird-flu-reimbursement-falls-short-2/"&gt;has an indemnity program&lt;/a&gt; that compensates poultry farmers for income lost to avian flu. In the 2023-24 outbreaks, affected Sonoma County farms received a total of $10.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt said he’s appreciative of “anything that helps keep us afloat,” but noted that he and the department are far apart in their estimation of fair market value for the ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also is hoping to open a discussion on USDA depopulation requirements. Because the flu is so highly transmissible, the federal agency insists on complete depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Could we have euthanized the affected birds and monitored the others? And continue testing birds?” Reichardt wondered, noting that only a couple dozen were confirmed sick in the recent outbreak. “I think I understand USDA’s stance. This thing is terrible. When it takes hold, it’s like a wildfire. But I think there are other methods to put out the wildfire. It’s a depressing process to put down healthy, happy birds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm must now wait four months before reintroducing birds, and it will takes months beyond that for young ducks to mature and become egg layers. Reichardt Duck Farm had yet to fully bounce back from late 2023, when the company was forced to euthanize more than 200,000 birds. The owner estimates that before getting the bad news last week, they were at about 40% of their pre-2023 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most depressing for Phil Reichardt is knowing there’s a good chance the staff members who have been handling the depopulation may soon find their hours slashed, or could even be laid off as some were two winters ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really gets me emotional. Some of them are family to us,” Reichardt said. “These people are working their butts off to put themselves out of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big California outbreak of 2023-24 was also in late October, at a turkey meat facility in Merced County. By the end of that winter, at least 6.3 million commercial birds had been killed in the state. In Sonoma County alone, officials estimated the financial loss to producers at around $22 million. The effects were felt well beyond farm properties, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/15/aftermath-of-bird-flu-lowers-supply-and-ups-cost-of-eggs-2/"&gt;egg prices skyrocketing in stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last winter was far more devastating statewide, with more than 16.5 million dead birds. But that pandemic left Sonoma County unscathed. This winter already threatens to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

"Given ongoing A(H5N1) outbreaks in animals, understanding the frequency of A(H5N1) virus infections among asymptomatic persons can inform public health risk assessments and infection prevention guidance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 symptom-less human infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team identified 10 reports of 18 asymptomatic human H5N1 infection, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robust data collection is needed from persons with possible asymptomatic A(H5N1) virus infection to inform future public health responses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two MSC cases occurred in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam who were identified through investigations of household contacts of index H5N1 patients; one patient was also exposed to infected chickens, and the other is believed to have been infected through human-to-human spread, because they had no contact with sick or dead poultry.  Neither MSC patient had used personal protective equipment when in close contact with an infected household member or chickens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 16 MC patients (14 adults and 2 children), 11 were identified through enhanced surveillance of people exposed to poultry infected with H5N1 (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, and 1 in the United Kingdom), and the remaining 5 patients (3 in Vietnam and 2 in Cambodia) were identified through contact tracing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Asymptomatic human infections with A(H5N1) virus have been infrequently reported, with most cases identified through enhanced surveillance or household contact investigations of persons with known exposure," the authors noted. "Robust data collection is needed from persons with possible asymptomatic A(H5N1) virus infection to inform future public health responses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaps in surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840687"&gt;&lt;span&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the same journal, Rick Bright, PhD, of Bright Global Health, and Nicole Lurie, MD, MSPH, of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Harvard Medical School, noted that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with confirmed infections in more than 800 herds in at least 16 states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in multiple states, and as of mid-2025, approximately 70 cases have been officially reported, most with mild illness but including at least 1 death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;High viral levels have been found in raw milk, and live virus has been detected in mammary tissue and milking equipment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Spillover into, and transmission among, other mammals has been documented, including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine," they wrote. "Human cases have been confirmed in multiple states, and as of mid-2025, approximately 70 cases have been officially reported, most with mild illness but including at least 1 death." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bright and Lurie said the findings challenge the traditional perception that human H5N1 infections are almost always symptomatic and severe and that no human-to-human H5N1 spread has occurred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It also highlights a critical gap in many national and global surveillance systems, which tend to focus on the detection of symptomatic illness rather than infection, and underscores the importance of carefully examining clusters where limited transmission may occur," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel E. Lieberman calls the rigid “8 hours” rule Industrial Era “nonsense,” noting that people without modern electricity typically sleep six to seven hours without napping, and large cohorts show the lowest mortality risk around seven hours, not eight. Lieberman expanded on the research for his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exercised/dp/0141986360/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1N2T1NB5HRXT0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.r2yZNIS8wod-0Kgg7gocBjwtCkGSc66oJbZSOygtbxxo4Fr4vBxrpZYlMIlz-d52RBSGySlsN38HyEJYeg1ebrp9D7viSXFM8UARQvVytXT24YdaJXaRSQDxFukCn4meo0KfgmLVju1xphiMdrqpRgF3eBqGlcesq9XPm4EWxf0aaAtAPd8kndKpim7HDSbDFpE4hZLyTG4MZCbMkkXkPBLK2xrIDw2utEcTWUGTwb0.Q0aT327twNqjo6QylD9UhZeXHpXcZZgBSB6PLHVhYRw&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=exercised+book&amp;amp;qid=1761848364&amp;amp;sprefix=exercised+book%2Caps%2C194&amp;amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.amazon.com/Exercised/dp/0141986360/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1N2T1NB5HRXT0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.r2yZNIS8wod-0Kgg7gocBjwtCkGSc66oJbZSOygtbxxo4Fr4vBxrpZYlMIlz-d52RBSGySlsN38HyEJYeg1ebrp9D7viSXFM8UARQvVytXT24YdaJXaRSQDxFukCn4meo0KfgmLVju1xphiMdrqpRgF3eBqGlcesq9XPm4EWxf0aaAtAPd8kndKpim7HDSbDFpE4hZLyTG4MZCbMkkXkPBLK2xrIDw2utEcTWUGTwb0.Q0aT327twNqjo6QylD9UhZeXHpXcZZgBSB6PLHVhYRw&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=exercised+book&amp;amp;qid=1761848364&amp;amp;sprefix=exercised+book%2Caps%2C194&amp;amp;sr=8-2" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Exercised: The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRwf1HdNjk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRwf1HdNjk" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;2023 interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The Diary of a CEO&lt;/em&gt;. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Lieberman argues&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lieberman says the idea “natural” humans sleep eight hours is unfounded; field data from communities without electric light show typical nightly sleep of about six to seven hours, contradicting the cultural prescription of eight hours as a target.&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/21/959140732/just-move-scientist-author-debunks-myths-about-exercise-and-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/21/959140732/just-move-scientist-author-debunks-myths-about-exercise-and-sleep" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;He frames modern eight‑hour dogma as a legacy of the Industrial Revolution rather than a biological necessity, and points to epidemiologic curves where risk bottoms out around seven hours, producing a U‑shape with higher risk from both short and long sleep.&lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Popular summaries of his stance emphasize seven hours often outperforms eight for health outcomes, while stressing variability by age and condition, and that sleep need is not one-size-fits-all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How much sleep do you really need?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; explainer&lt;/a&gt;, sleep scientist Rebecca Robbins addresses the eight-hour belief, explaining how the benchmark emerged and offering practical tactics to improve sleep quality rather than fixating on a single number.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than one-third of Americans &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;miss the seven-hour minimum&lt;/a&gt;, underscoring the importance of consistency and sleep hygiene as much as chasing a magic number.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society recommend “seven or more hours per night” for adults—explicitly a range beginning at seven rather than an eight-hour mandate.&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; guidance aligns: Adults generally need seven or more hours, with individual variation based on age, sleep quality, prior sleep debt, pregnancy, and aging patterns that fragment sleep but do not increase total need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The U‑shaped risk curve&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple large contemporary &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;datasets show&lt;/a&gt; a U‑shaped association between sleep duration and adverse outcomes, with the nadir around seven hours for all‑cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;U.K. Biobank analyses also report U‑shaped relationships, with elevated risks for both short sleep (less than seven hours) and long sleep (often defined as more than nine hours for adults), after adjusting for health and lifestyle factors.&lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.10732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.10732" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mechanistic and biomarker work echoes the U‑shape, with deviations below seven or above eight to nine hours linked to markers of biological aging, though causality can be confounded by illness extending time in bed.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10178027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10178027/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical guidance for sleep&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for seven to nine hours, using seven as a realistic minimum if you wake refreshed and function well; extend toward nine during illness, heavy training, or pregnancy as needed.&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Watch for the U‑shape: chronic short sleep (less than seven hours) and habitual long sleep (more than 9 hours) are both linked to higher risks; if you routinely need more than nine hours, consult a clinician to evaluate for underlying conditions like depression, sleep apnea, or chronic disease.&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Prioritize consistency and quality—regular bed/wake times, morning light, reduced evening blue light, cool dark bedrooms, and limiting caffeine/alcohol—rather than obsessing over an eight‑hour target.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The ‘sweet spot’ for sleep&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The eight‑hour rule is a cultural simplification, not a universal biological requirement; seven hours often sits at the health “sweet spot” for many adults, with flexibility around that based on life stage and health.&lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Business leaders and individuals should reframe sleep goals toward the evidence-based range and measurable daytime function, investing in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;sleep quality practices &lt;/a&gt;that improve performance and long‑term health without enforcing a rigid eight‑hour quota.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 stretched on, scientists watched for all sorts of unintended effects, from social to economic to environmental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the experts who predict disease transmission wondered specifically whether infectious diseases other than COVID-19 would surge after the prolonged isolation of the population. Would social distancing cause us to have less immunity to common diseases? Would those diseases rebound with deadly consequences?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw4964"&gt;paper published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Georgia’s &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/directory/toby-brett/"&gt;Tobias Brett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/directory/pejman-rohani/"&gt;Pejman Rohani&lt;/a&gt; explored which infectious diseases were impacted by COVID-19 control measures and, of those, which rebounded. They found airborne diseases were most likely to rebound — but not as much as some feared. Surprisingly, the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases remained low, even long after pandemic-era behaviors changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-medium"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-300x300.jpeg" alt="Environmental portrait of a man in front of greenery outside" class="wp-image-83406" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Tobias Brett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early in the pandemic, there was some concern raised in the scientific community that lockdowns would disrupt the circulation of other diseases, such as influenza, and this would lead to what are called ‘gaps in immunity.’ So basically, because people aren’t getting infected, they aren’t developing immunity to the disease, and so then you’ve got this big buildup in the susceptible population,” said Brett, lead author of the study and a senior research associate in the &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/"&gt;Odum School of Ecology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing nationwide disease data from 2019 to 2023, the researchers found an increase in cases of airborne diseases like influenza and pertussis after COVID. But fewer Americans got the flu during the pandemic and, while more people started to catch flu again when lockdowns lifted, it didn’t make up for the months when social distance kept flu from spreading.  In other words, Americans caught less flu during the pandemic and the years after than would have been expected without a COVID-19 pandemic and the behavior changes that went with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It means that the fears of a rebound were valid, but the rebound didn’t cancel out the deficit,” he said. “Obviously, there were negative consequences associated with the lockdowns, but in terms of other infectious diseases, the effect wasn’t negative and was, in fact, a net positive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Airborne diseases increased slightly, STIs dropped post-pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brett and Rohani looked at the number of reported cases of 26 different pathogens, clustering them into three groups related to how they are transmitted: airborne/aerosol transmitted diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and environmentally transmitted diseases, such as food poisoning or illnesses spread by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that whether other diseases surged after the pandemic depended largely on how the disease is transmitted. Airborne diseases, such as flu, surged more, while STIs were less affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chlamydia and gonorrhea were on the rise leading into the pandemic, for example. But transmission of those diseases dropped in every state during COVID and stayed lower than expected long after the pandemic ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-300x202.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-101110" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-768x517.jpg 768w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-2048x1379.jpg 2048w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-549x370.jpg 549w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1096x738.jpg 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pejman Rohani (Photo by Peter Frey/UGA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Notifications of those sexually transmitted diseases flatlined, and we don’t know why,” Brett said. “Explanations could include improved treatment practices post-COVID or a greater investment in public health after the COVID pandemic. Another explanation could be changing behavior. It’s definitely a subject for further study.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More broadly, this study highlights the important unanticipated effects of public health measures targeted at one infectious disease for other diseases,” said Rohani, Regents’ Professor and UGA Athletic Association Professor in Ecology and Infectious Diseases. “This points to a need to think holistically about the community of infectious diseases.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alaska ranks as America’s most stressed state&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by the nation’s highest suicide rate (28.15 per 100,000), sky-high living costs 25% above the national average, and harsh isolation that limits access to healthcare and legal resources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts residents experience the lowest stress levels&lt;/strong&gt; in the country with the best safety rating, lowest suicide rate (8.58 per 100,000), and strong access to mental health and legal services despite having the highest cost of living.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal injury lawyers report that state stress levels directly correlate with accident and injury claims&lt;/strong&gt;, as residents in high-stress environments face greater risks from financial strain, poor housing, unsafe working conditions, and delayed medical care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alaska is the most stressed state in the nation, according to a new nationwide study that reveals how geography plays a massive role in American mental health. Researchers analyzed everything from crime rates to air quality across all 50 states and found that where Americans live might matter more than previously thought when it comes to daily pressure and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by Florida personal injury law firm Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine, shows that Alaska earned the dubious distinction of America’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/land-of-the-worried-83-of-americans-very-stressed-over-nations-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most stressed state&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 84.50, more than three times that of Massachusetts, which came in at 24.90. For context, Alaska’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suicide rate&lt;/a&gt; of 28.15 per 100,000 residents is more than triple the national average. Add in a cost of living that runs 25% above the national average and a safety score of just 44.2, and the numbers paint a picture of a population under serious strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“High-stress environments show up in our caseload,” says Marc Anidjar, Founding Senior Partner at Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine. “People dealing with constant &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/debt-america-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial strain&lt;/a&gt;, safety concerns, and poor living conditions face higher rates of accidents and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-fuel-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health crises&lt;/a&gt;. These pressures compound, affecting their overall wellbeing and often leading to legal situations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental illness affects approximately 51.5 million American adults, or about one in five people. Many of these cases result in stress-related legal claims, and personal injury lawyers are seeing more clients whose health problems stem from chronic pressure and anxiety. But the new research shows that not all states face equal levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-a-state-stressed"&gt;What Makes a State Stressed?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined five key factors to determine stress levels: state safety based on crime statistics, suicide rates indicating mental health struggles, cost of living showing financial burden, environmental quality measured through air pollution and waste management, and the share of residents living in extreme poverty. Higher scores indicate greater &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/open-office-seating-linked-to-lower-stress-greater-activity-levels-among-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After Alaska, New Mexico claimed second place with a stress score of 81.62, followed by Louisiana at 70.20. Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, Kentucky, Arkansas, Washington, and Hawaii rounded out the top 10 most stressed states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Mexico faces serious safety and poverty concerns. With a safety score of just 39.7, residents experience higher crime rates and less security than most other states. New Mexico also has the second-highest suicide rate at 22.76 per 100,000, signaling deep mental health struggles. An alarming 8.20% of the state’s population lives in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poverty-kills-more-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extreme poverty&lt;/a&gt;, one of the highest rates in the nation. Poor environmental conditions, reflected in a cleanliness score of 35.37, add another layer of daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We see how poverty and safety issues intersect in personal injury cases,” explains Anidjar. “When people can’t afford safe housing or reliable transportation, they’re at greater risk for accidents. When they get hurt, they often lack resources for proper medical treatment or legal help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-1200x480.png" alt="Most Stressed States" class="wp-image-145796" srcset="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-1200x480.png 1200w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-475x190.png 475w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-768x307.png 768w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-400x160.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Top 10 Most Stressed States (Credit: Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Louisiana rounds out the top three with the highest extreme poverty rate in the analysis at 9.00%, meaning nearly one in eleven residents struggles to meet basic needs. While the state’s cost of living index of 92.3 sits below the national average, widespread poverty means many residents still can’t make ends meet. Louisiana’s suicide rate of 15.56 reflects the mental health toll of these combined pressures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Louisiana’s poverty crisis creates a cascade of legal issues,” Anidjar notes. “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Financial desperation&lt;/a&gt; leads to unsafe working conditions, inadequate housing, and delayed medical care, increasing the likelihood of injuries and accidents. People in these situations often don’t know their rights or how to access legal protections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-calm-corner-of-america"&gt;The Calm Corner of America&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum, Massachusetts takes the top spot as the least stressed state with a score of just 24.90. Residents of the Bay State enjoy the highest safety rating at 60.2 and the lowest suicide rate at 8.58 per 100,000, less than a third of Alaska’s rate. These numbers reflect a population with better access to mental health resources and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/americans-incarceration-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;safer communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts posts a cleanliness score of 80.97. In this index, higher values represent greater environmental stress. However, residents pay for it. Massachusetts has the highest cost-of-living index in the top ten at 141.2, over 40% above the national average. Despite this, only 5.00% of the population lives in extreme poverty, suggesting most residents can afford the higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Better-resourced states like Massachusetts have stronger safety nets,” Anidjar explains. “People have better access to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare,&lt;/a&gt; mental health services, and legal aid. When accidents or injuries happen, residents can get help more easily, reducing long-term stress and preventing bigger legal problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Jersey claims the second-lowest stress score at 25.72 and the lowest suicide rate in the country at 7.19 per 100,000. With 4.70% living in extreme poverty and a cost of living index of 115.1, New Jersey residents generally have the financial means to handle life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New Jersey’s proximity to major metropolitan areas means better access to specialized medical care and legal services,” says Anidjar. “When people can quickly get help after an injury or mental health crisis, it prevents situations from becoming more serious legal matters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire rounds out the top three with a stress score of 26.14 and the lowest extreme poverty rate at just 3.90%. Fewer residents struggle with basic needs compared to other states. A safety score of 58.2 and cleanliness score of 73.43 show residents enjoy relatively safe, clean communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-1200x473.png" alt="Least Stressed States" class="wp-image-145797" srcset="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-1200x473.png 1200w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-475x187.png 475w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-768x303.png 768w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-400x158.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Top 10 Least Stressed States (Credit: Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-alaska-factor"&gt;The Alaska Factor&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alaska’s isolation creates unique legal challenges that compound stress levels. When someone experiences a stress-related injury or mental health crisis, access to proper medical care and legal resources becomes difficult. Harsh living conditions, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sunlight-winter-weight-gain-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limited sunlight&lt;/a&gt; during winter months, and financial strain make people more vulnerable to accidents and health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basic necessities cost far more in Alaska than in the lower 48 states. Every dollar counts when the cost of living runs 25% above the national average. While Alaska’s extreme poverty rate of 5.60% might seem moderate compared to states like Louisiana, the actual cost of surviving in the Last Frontier makes financial pressure more intense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Living in a high-stress state affects not only your daily mood, but your physical health, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/decision-making/"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;, and overall safety, too,” Anidjar commented. “We’ve seen firsthand how chronic stress contributes to accidents, workplace injuries, and mental health emergencies that require legal support.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People facing constant &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial pressure&lt;/a&gt;, unsafe neighborhoods, or poor environmental conditions need to know that legal protections exist. Whether dealing with a workplace injury, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/adhd-car-accidents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a car accident&lt;/a&gt; caused by poorly maintained roads, or health issues stemming from environmental hazards, Americans have rights that can provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many states offer victim compensation programs, workers’ compensation benefits, and personal injury protections that can provide financial relief during difficult times. Free consultations with personal injury attorneys can clarify options without adding financial burden. Understanding legal rights is often the first step toward reducing stress and getting necessary support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For residents of high-stress states like Alaska, New Mexico, and Louisiana, knowing these protections exist can make a real difference when facing accidents or injuries. Meanwhile, residents of lower-stress states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New Hampshire benefit from better infrastructure and resources that help prevent crises before they happen. But regardless of where Americans live, understanding available legal protections remains crucial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; and recovering from unexpected setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined stress levels across all 50 US states by analyzing five key factors. Safety ratings from 2025 indicate overall state safety based on crime rates and law enforcement data, measured on an index of 0 to 100, where lower safety levels contribute to higher stress. Suicide rates from 2023 measure the number of suicides per 100,000 residents, with higher values suggesting increased mental and social stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost-of-living index from 2025 reflects average &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-rising-living-costs-changing-way-we-date-live-and-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;living costs&lt;/a&gt;, including housing, groceries, healthcare, and utilities, based on a national average of 100, where higher costs indicate higher stress. Cleanliness scores combine three environmental factors from 2023 to 2025: CO₂ emissions data from 2023 measuring total greenhouse gas emissions by state in metric tons of CO₂, air quality index from 2025 showing average annual AQI by state where higher numbers reflect poorer air quality, and landfill density from 2024 measuring the number of active landfills per 10,000 square miles. Each environmental sub-factor was normalized and averaged to create the cleanliness score, with higher scores indicating poorer environmental quality and greater stress contribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Share of population living in extreme poverty from 2024 represents the percentage of residents living below 50% of the poverty line, measured as a percentage where higher values indicate greater financial pressure. To calculate the final stress score, all factors were normalized on a scale of 0 to 1, then averaged and multiplied by 100. A higher score indicates higher overall state stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;

				Gallup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt; After peaking at a record high of 39.9% in 2022, the U.S. adult obesity rate has &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;gradually declined to 37.0% in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. This is a statistically meaningful decrease representing an estimated 7.6 million fewer obese adults compared with three years ago. Meanwhile, diagnoses of diabetes -- a lifetime disease that can be managed but not cured -- have now reached an all-time high of 13.8%. Both metrics are part of the ongoing Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

[...] Over the past year, more Americans have turned to Type 2 antidiabetic GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss purposes. The percentage of adults who report taking this class of medicine specifically for weight loss has increased to 12.4%, compared with 5.8% in February 2024 when Gallup first measured it. Usage among women (15.2%) continues to outpace men (9.7%), but both groups have more than doubled their use in the past year. These results dovetail with increased awareness of the drugs used for weight loss, which has risen from 80% to 89% nationally in the same period.&lt;/i&gt;

It’s now surging again in US poultry operations and could result in another winter of high egg prices — and tens of millions of dead birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last two months, the virus was detected on nearly 50 commercial poultry farms, leading to the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians"&gt;mass culling&lt;/a&gt; of 7.3 million farmed birds — more than during the same period in previous years. Three-quarters of those birds were egg-laying hens from just three egg factory farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Although that culling involves an enormous amount of animal suffering, the deaths represent less than 2 percent of US egg-laying hens, which, for now, isn’t enough to meaningfully affect egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But given the early wave of mortality across a range of species compared to the last couple years, the sheer number of farms that have reported outbreaks, and the fact that a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/health/bird-flu-variant-nevada-human-case"&gt;newer bird flu variant&lt;/a&gt; has become dominant, it “doesn’t bode well for a quiet year” for the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/about-us/people/krysten-schuler"&gt;Krysten Schuler&lt;/a&gt; — an associate research professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University — told me in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For nearly four years, bird flu has wreaked havoc on the US poultry industry and the birds themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai-depopulation-disposal.pdf"&gt;Federal policy&lt;/a&gt; requires that as soon as the virus is detected on a farm, the entire flock must be killed to slow the spread of the disease. So far, poultry farms have killed more than &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;180 million birds&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the outbreak in early 2022. And the prevailing method of killing is grim: Producers close barn vents and pump in heat to raise the temperature, which slowly — and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/14/killing-chickens-bird-flu-vsd/"&gt;painfully&lt;/a&gt; — kills the birds via &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians"&gt;heat stroke&lt;/a&gt; over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The virus has also spilled over to infect &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/animal-health/situation-updates/global-aiv-with-zoonotic-potential/bird-species-affected-by-h5nx-hpai/en?fbclid=IwY2xjawJBNJVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHXjrgdsxDiVY31-svDHVEVzSHa3Sq5_ZzJwMkDOcrTzDxK2n5UNopOtyXQ_aem_zvon3ViBbCJLSSONfXFswQ"&gt;hundreds of other bird species and mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety"&gt;dairy cows&lt;/a&gt;, foxes, bears, seals, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/risk-factors/bird-flu-in-pets.html"&gt;pet cats&lt;/a&gt;. Seventy human cases have been reported in the US, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/m0106-h5-birdflu-death.html"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are increasingly worried that the virus could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00245-6"&gt;evolve into the next human pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s been a costly disease. The government has spent billions to manage it, including compensating egg and dairy producers for their losses, while consumers have spent an additional &lt;a href="https://innovateanimalag.org/hpai-costs-2025"&gt;$14.5 billion on eggs&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and 2025 alone, according to one estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have questions or comments on this newsletter?&lt;/strong&gt; Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Through it all, the egg, chicken, and turkey industries have relied on improving biosecurity on farms — like sealing barn openings and disinfecting vehicles and equipment — in an effort to keep the virus out and killing infected flocks when that doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Several effective bird flu vaccines for use in poultry birds have been licensed in the US, which you’d think would be a no-brainer solution to the outbreak. But they’ve yet to be deployed, because they’d disrupt international trade for the chicken meat industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But now, the egg and turkey sectors — which are disproportionately affected by bird flu — are attempting to change that and are &lt;a href="https://www.agriculture.com/usda-develops-potential-plan-to-vaccinate-poultry-for-bird-flu-11758561?"&gt;pushing for the US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; to advance a vaccination program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Earlier this year, the trade group United Egg Producers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://hickmanseggs.com/avian-PDF/UEP-Board-Approved-HPAI-Vaccination-and-Surveillance-Plan.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; sent to the USDA that the approach of killing birds and beefing up biosecurity is “no longer adequate to prevent and control this devastating disease” and that “it is time for a new approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-egg-industrys-bird-flu-vaccine-plan-and-why-it-hasnt-moved-forward" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The egg industry’s bird flu vaccine plan — and why it hasn’t moved forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To mitigate the impact of the virus, the egg and turkey industries wouldn’t need to vaccinate all of their 300 million hens or 200 million turkeys. Instead, they would focus on farms located in the &lt;a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/29233-egg-industry-seeks-action-as-hpai-devastates-flocks"&gt;four major flyways&lt;/a&gt; where wild birds migrate and shed the virus, which is where farms have been hardest hit by bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many egg and turkey producers are eager to start vaccination programs, the US doesn’t let them over concerns that it would impact the chicken meat industry’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year, chicken meat companies exported &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/poultry-eggs/sector-at-a-glance"&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their product, which is valued at &lt;a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/livestock-and-poultry-market-news/poultry-and-egg-export-volumes-lower-to-close-out-2024"&gt;$4.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. But most of the countries that import American chicken meat would &lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letter-to-USDA-Re-HPAI-Vaccine.pdf"&gt;pause those imports&lt;/a&gt; if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; farmed birds in the US are vaccinated, even if no chickens raised for meat are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reason behind these blanket bans stems from importing countries’ concerns around the so-called “DIVA” problem, which is short for “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals.” It represents the challenge of identifying whether a poultry bird is infected with bird flu or simply has avian influenza antibodies from vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s led the chicken meat industry, for now, to firmly oppose vaccination of any poultry birds in the US. “Until we have written assurances and trade protections in place with our trading partners, we will continue to oppose vaccination for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI),” a spokesperson with the National Chicken Council wrote in an email to Vox. (Losing $4.7 billion in export value would also lead to an oversupply of chicken in the US, which would hurt the industry’s profits.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R9abcrib96:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;In 2022, over 5 million egg-laying hens were culled after bird flu was detected at a farm in Iowa owned by the egg giant Rembrandt.

The USDA surveils the affected area for bird flu and tests birds until the virus is no longer detected and trade resumes once the US has proven that exports are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It would be the same approach here with the vaccination strategy,” John Clifford, a former USDA chief veterinary officer and current adviser to the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, told me. The US would show trading partners “how the US would still protect them, and we would not be shipping them any products that would be unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s precedent for this approach. Since late 2023, France has been vaccinating ducks against the bird flu, which has proven to be &lt;a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/poultry-meat/diseases-health/avian-influenza/news/15768593/france-resumes-hpai-vaccination-program"&gt;highly effective&lt;/a&gt;. But in response, the US and Canada banned poultry imports from France, which the countries lifted early this year after French authorities “succeeded in convincing the American and Canadian authorities of the safety” of vaccination, according to &lt;a href="https://www.euromeatnews.com/Article-United-States-and-Canada-lift-of-embargo-on-poultry-imports-from-France/8118"&gt;Euro Meat News&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccination program has cost French duck producers a little under &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-kicks-off-bird-flu-vaccination-despite-trade-backlash-risk-2023-10-02/"&gt;$2 per bird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In June, the USDA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/usda-develops-potential-plan-vaccinate-poultry-bird-flu-2025-06-20/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was developing a vaccination plan to show to countries that import US chicken meat as a way to gauge whether vaccination would disrupt trade. The update represented forward momentum, but some scientific experts, and some in the egg industry, are becoming increasingly impatient with the USDA’s reluctance to allow egg producers to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The agency is, according to them, putting the chicken meat industry’s financial well-being above the massive impacts the bird flu has had on egg, turkey, and dairy producers. I would add that it’s also putting it above American consumers, animal welfare, and broader public health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The USDA didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="actually-measuring-the-cost-of-bird-flu" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actually measuring the cost of bird flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Glenn Hickman, a large egg producer in Arizona who had to cull millions of hens earlier this year, has been direct about how he feels about the status quo. “The reason we’re not vaccinating chickens in this country today is because of trade implications…but I’m past caring,” Hickman &lt;a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/hickman-details-slow-motion-wreck-from-bird-flu"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the agricultural publication Feedstuffs in July. “I’d like to vaccinate my chickens and protect my flock, and I cannot because of the obstacles that the poultry meat industry is putting in front of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The argument that we shouldn’t vaccinate egg-laying hens and turkeys in order to protect $5 billion or so in chicken meat exports doesn’t sit well with &lt;a href="https://vetmed.umn.edu/bio/college-of-veterinary-medicine/carol-cardona"&gt;Carol Cardona&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Cardona told me that when people say the cost of vaccination is too high, she says “the cost of outbreaks is too high.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re not necessarily measuring” the cost of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; vaccinating, Cardona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those costs, she said, include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The virus evolving to infect &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/animal-health/situation-updates/global-aiv-with-zoonotic-potential/bird-species-affected-by-h5nx-hpai/en?fbclid=IwY2xjawJBNJVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHXjrgdsxDiVY31-svDHVEVzSHa3Sq5_ZzJwMkDOcrTzDxK2n5UNopOtyXQ_aem_zvon3ViBbCJLSSONfXFswQ"&gt;hundreds of new bird and mammal species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The environmental impact of raising so many poultry birds who are never consumed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The burden on human health and the cost of preventing human infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The mental health impact on farmers, veterinarians, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/egg-factory-avian-flu-chickens-culled-workers-fired-iowa"&gt;farm workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Infections reported at more than 1,000 US dairy farms, resulting in illness for an unknown number of cows and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61553-z"&gt;economic losses for dairy producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are also, of course, the 182 million birds killed — mostly via painful heat stroke — in the US alone, along with the billions in taxpayer dollars spent to &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/05/30/usda-announces-824-million-new-funding-protect-livestock-health-launches-voluntary-h5n1-dairy-herd"&gt;suppress the virus and compensate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.farmforward.com/publications/subsidizing-the-spread-bird-flu-bailouts-expand-from-poultry-to-dairy/"&gt;egg and dairy producers&lt;/a&gt; for their losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As far as I’m aware, no economist has put a comprehensive dollar amount on the bird flu’s annual toll, but it’s likely much higher than the economic damage it would do to the chicken meat industry.

			&lt;p&gt;Honing in on the junk-food pyramid to rank its most harmful members, researchers from Virginia Tech have discovered that ultra-processed meats and beverages are the worst for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who consumed one or more extra servings of either of these foods showed a significantly increased risk of developing cognitive impairments, including those associated with forms of dementia such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178582" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, the researchers tracked 4,750 US residents aged 55 or older to evaluate how their health had evolved over a period of up to 7 years, assessing their cognitive status every two years from 2014 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-daily-diet-of-burgers-and-pizzas-could-be-putting-you-at-risk-of-alzheimers"&gt;A Daily Diet of Burgers And Pizzas Could Be Putting You at Risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-could-sabotage-weight-loss-even-on-a-healthy-diet"&gt;previously explored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;in general&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though researchers had yet to compare discrete categories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health costs of a diet heavy in UPFs are now known to include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2023.09.009"&gt;obesity, type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular diseases, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2024.11.011"&gt;anxiety, depression&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-078476"&gt;all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, diets high in UPFs also have a detrimental impact on brain health. However, a more specific question remained: which specific junk foods were driving these associations, if any?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer (sadly, for many) encompasses some of the most-consumed comfort foods known to culinary science: meats and beverages, meaning that a meat-lover's pizza and a cola could combine to create a double brain-bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg" alt="meat and soda" class="wp-image-178596 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sugary drinks like sodas and heavily processed meats were the big offenders.

They tested both immediate and delayed recall capacity, along with other assessments such as counting backward or subtracting several numbers in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 1,363 of the participants developed cognitive impairment. Those who consumed at least one extra serving of ultra-processed animal products per day showed a 17 percent heightened risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-diet-soda-a-day-may-raise-your-type-2-diabetes-risk-by-38"&gt;sodas&lt;/a&gt;, iced teas, and sugary fruit drinks, were only a bit less brain-rotting, as individuals who consumed at least one extra serving per day showed a 6 percent increase in the risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that total UPF consumption was not significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Neither were other UPFs, such as spreads, sweets, savory snacks, grain- and dairy-based foods, or ready-to-eat meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, this new research shows that patients have a simple, if not necessarily easy, avenue for protecting their brain health: making dietary changes to avoid ultra-processed meats and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are things that you can change," &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brenda Davy, professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise at Virginia Tech and the study's co-author. "It's moderation and being reasonable and balanced in your dietary choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the overabundance of junk food may be shocking. About &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2024.100713"&gt;65 percent of foods and 38 percent&lt;/a&gt; of beverages bought by US households in 2020 were considered UPFs, which are characterized by high industrial processing and the presence of artificial colors, flavorings, and emulsifiers – additives that aren't present in home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both the younger generations and older adults get more than half their daily calories from these UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest cooking classes could offer a crucial healthcare intervention – knowing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;what to eat&lt;/a&gt;, and how to prepare it, can be half the battle when making better food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Virginia Tech human development scientist Ben Katz &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;, "It's one thing to follow a diet, but it's another thing to give [people] the cooking skills to prepare that diet." So while the junk-food statistics may seem daunting, at least there's a clear and achievable strategy for dealing with decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525000760"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcjpqa200003b6n8gf7x5v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Happier people are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069072717751441" target="_blank"&gt;more successful in their careers&lt;/a&gt;, have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12910" target="_blank"&gt;more fulfilling relationships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743519302300" target="_blank"&gt;live longer, healthier lives&lt;/a&gt;, previous research has shown. Now, scientists say they have identified the “happiness threshold” needed for a country’s population as a whole to achieve certain health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00013b6n6mtuiz71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, a nation’s happiness level can influence its people’s risk of premature death from chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disease, according to a study published October 20 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1667645/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00023b6nggl0u0p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research team used a scale called the Life Ladder to estimate the happiness levels of 123 countries. Zero represents the worst possible life imaginable and 10 the best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00033b6nes3lqevn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once a country surpassed a score of 2.7, its happiness was tied to a decrease in deaths due to chronic or noncommunicable diseases among people 30 to 70 years old, researchers found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00043b6n1sumygob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scores ranged from 2.18 to 7.97, with an average of 5.45. The United States was among the countries analyzed, but individual Life Ladder scores weren’t published in the study. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/worlds-happiest-countries-2025-wellness"&gt;2025 World Happiness Report&lt;/a&gt;, ranks the US as the world’s 24th-happiest country, with a score of 6.72.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00053b6ngkeg119x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Policies that lift national Life-Ladder scores above the 2.7 threshold — through investments in health systems, anti-corruption reforms, social safety nets, and healthy urban environments — can initiate a reinforcing cycle of higher happiness and lower mortality,” lead study author Iulia Iuga said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00063b6nt2kfjb1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evidence suggests that raising well-being while curbing obesity, alcohol use, and pollution could produce dual dividends: stronger happiness and healthier, longer lives.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00073b6nlmovj9cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For countries at or above the 2.7 threshold, “improving well-being can measurably extend &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/global-mortality-risk-factors-adolescents-young-adults"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; when societies reach a basic level of stability and satisfaction,” said Iuga, a professor in the department of finance and accounting at 1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba Iulia in Romania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00083b6nukkd5aki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Iuga hopes her team’s work has implications for governing bodies and public health organizations that can influence happiness and health at the population level. She plans to continue her research by testing the happiness threshold against other health metrics, such as years lived with a disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhcml8d0000b3b6nl0qijsgs@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="more-than-just-fun-and-pleasure" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘More than just fun and pleasure’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00093b6nvhs7k28n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each 1% increase in well-being correlated to a 0.43% decrease in the chronic-disease mortality rate among adults 30 to 70 years old, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d000a3b6n5bo4hhh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This research adds to the existing body of literature linking happiness to health, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Positive Activities and Well-Being Laboratory, or &lt;a href="https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/pawlab/" target="_blank"&gt;PAWLab&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhck9gnf000r3b6nlen3d8dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Traditionally, happiness is seen as a little bit of a luxury. It feels good,” Lyubomirsky said. The new study shows “that happiness could be the public health variable. It’s about more than just fun and pleasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000e3b6nqm0qgitk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Happiness is but one facet of a person’s health. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness"&gt;Genetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/health/alcohol-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/health/airborne-microplastics-study-wellness"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; factors also play a role in the risk of dying from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000f3b6ncdisn5ca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want to leave people the impression that if only they were happier, they would be healthier, they would be fine,” Lyubomirsky said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000g3b6npcul1ff3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to avoid placing blame, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000h3b6nk0kj015l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You don’t want to say, ‘If you don’t live as long, then it’s your fault because you’re not happy enough,’” she said. Not to mention, you only have so much control over your happiness as it relates to where you live. You might be born into a politically unstable country through no fault of your own or unable to afford to move out of an area with poor air quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000i3b6n6nfss9q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having spent decades studying the well-being of individuals, Lyubomirsky said gauging the happiness of entire countries comes with challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000j3b6n3w5x0fjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really hard,” she said. “You cannot get a sample of every single person in the country, so you want to make sure that’s a representative sample.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000k3b6ne19nc56c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers cited incomplete data on countries in conflict and low-income nations as a limitation of the study. In addition, longevity analysis is limited because mortality data for noncommunicable diseases didn’t go beyond age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000l3b6nhwq44s25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saida Heshmati, director of the Human Emotion and Relationships across Time and Culture, or &lt;a href="https://heshmatiheartlab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HEART Lab&lt;/a&gt;, at Claremont Graduate University in California, said happiness isn’t the word she’d use to describe what the study is trying to measure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000m3b6nc42g2tbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we say ‘happiness,’ people tend to think about experiencing more positive emotions — joy and having meaning in life and having a sense of accomplishment,” said Heshmati, also an assistant professor of psychology, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The (Life Ladder) doesn’t necessarily get into those components.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjjpd00133b6n6rrnt16p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati referred to the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_259" target="_blank"&gt;Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called Cantril’s Ladder, a standardized well-being assessment that serves as the basis for the Life Ladder scores in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000o3b6nrb9z7nao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t about happiness as a fleeting emotion,” Heshmati said. “It’s really about this general life satisfaction cognitive evaluation, which is a reflection of whether societies are providing those material, social and psychological foundations for people to thrive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000q3b6nfhu9m2t9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors of the new study pulled data about health factors including air pollution, body mass index and alcohol consumption from the &lt;a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318875/global-research.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup World Poll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators" target="_blank"&gt;World Development Indicators&lt;/a&gt; collected from 2006 through 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000r3b6ns6a6wbha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Noncommunicable diseases accounted for at least 43 million deaths globally, or 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths, in 2021, according to WHO. Nearly 42% of those people died prematurely, before age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckkoki001e3b6ndvgnnxqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eighty percent of premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases that year were attributed to four disease groups: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/health/heart-disease-risk-factors-wellness"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; (19 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/health/early-onset-colorectal-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; (10 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/health/copd-lung-disease-wellness"&gt;chronic respiratory disease&lt;/a&gt; (4 million deaths); and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/health/diabetes-undiagnosed-half-of-americans-wellness"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (2 million deaths).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000t3b6nb0ejwfy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Countries with higher per-person health spending — what a person spends on doctor visits and prescription medications, for example — generally exceeded the happiness threshold. Ethiopia had the lowest per-capita spending at $9 in 2006, while the US had the highest at $12,000 in 2021. The average across all countries evaluated was $1,300.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000u3b6ngpjlk2sf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati likes to think of the happiness threshold as a stability threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000v3b6nzsl0s9ga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re below that threshold, it seems you’re in stress mode and survival mode,” she said, which can have physiological consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjyr000193b6nxk5tugdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While individual well-being adds up to represent the happiness of a nation, Heshmati cautions against applying the study’s conclusions to your own health and risk of death from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000x3b6n1q8q2i8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can’t just say that becoming or feeling slightly happier directly changes your biology,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000y3b6n2dsllmzt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati recommends thinking about your own happiness holistically. Simple pleasures matter, she said, but they come and go and can leave a sense of emptiness due to their fleeting nature. Instead, focus on lasting markers of well-being such as maintaining strong social ties, cultivating a sense of purpose and pursuing goals that make you feel accomplished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000z3b6nm98vppaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The good news: Elevated and high blood pressure can &lt;em data-node-id="8.3"&gt;often &lt;/em&gt;(but not always) be addressed with diet and lifestyle modifications, said Dr. Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="causes-of-high-blood-pressure" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;Causes of high blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;1. You eat too many processed foods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="11" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Excessive sodium intake has a direct impact on blood pressure. “More salt equals more sodium in the blood, which then pulls water from the surrounding tissues into your vessels and increases blood volume,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. “More blood volume leads to higher blood pressure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But if you’re thinking, &lt;em data-node-id="13.1"&gt;I don’t even use that much salt&lt;/em&gt;, it’s probably still hiding elsewhere in your diet.

And of that, more than 70% of a person’s sodium intake is coming from processed and restaurant foods, including things like bread, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g28567921/best-healthy-cereals/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g28567921/best-healthy-cereals/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breakfast cereal" data-node-id="13.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;breakfast cereal&lt;/a&gt;, chips, cookies, pizza, canned beans and veggies, canned soups, and pasta sauce—not the salt shaker itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Additionally, a diet heavy in processed foods can cause weight gain, and “when people are overweight, the body has to pump blood to more tissue, which can increase blood pressure,” said Dr. Phillips. “We see an extremely large amount of high blood pressure in obese patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="15" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;BP fix: Favor fresh, whole foods whenever possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Instead, load up on whole foods rich in beneficial nutrients, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, fish, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, suggested Dr. Beniaminovitz. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Potassium" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.1.0"&gt;Potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20105121/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20105121/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="magnesium" data-node-id="16.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.3.0"&gt;magnesium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are both minerals that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/key-minerals-to-help-control-blood-pressure" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/key-minerals-to-help-control-blood-pressure" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="help blood vessels relax" data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.5.0"&gt;help blood vessels relax&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn can help lower blood pressure; and &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22575" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22575" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="16.7" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; links high-fiber diets to significant reductions in systolic blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you want to follow a specific dietary plan that’s been proven to lower blood pressure, Dr. Beniaminovitz recommended either the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or a well-formulated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean Diet" data-node-id="17.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.3.0"&gt;Mediterranean Diet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-having-more-than-one-alcoholic-drink-per-day" data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;2. You have more than one alcoholic drink per day on a regular basis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;For people who already drink, moderate alcohol consumption (one drink a day for women, two a day for men) is often not a problem, and &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001341" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001341" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="some research" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="19.1.0"&gt;some research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests it may even help prevent heart disease. However, heavier  alcohol consumption—especially frequent binge drinking episodes—can lead to chronically elevated blood pressure, said Dr. Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;BP fix: &lt;/strong&gt;Imbibe in moderation.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Aim for just one drink at a time, which equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of spirits. And if it’s really more about the ritual than the alcohol itself, consider periodically swapping out your glass of cabernet for a kombucha or other non-alcoholic option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-not-getting-enough-exercise" data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;3. You’re not active enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sitting too much or leading a sedentary lifestyle can mess with just about every aspect of your health, and your cardiovascular health is no exception. “Being sedentary leads to elevated blood pressure, both indirectly and directly,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. Sedentary people tend to be overweight or obese, and as mentioned above, weight is one of the main driving causes of high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Additionally, getting regular aerobic activity helps you maintain a healthy blood pressure by making blood vessels more compliant (or flexible) and less sensitive to hormonal influences, he explained—so a lack of such activity may accelerate arterial hardening, forcing the heart and blood vessels to work that much harder. &lt;strong data-node-id="24.1"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="25" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;BP fix: Get your body moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859.full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859.full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research analysis" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;research analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 400 studies suggests that regular exercise could be as effective as commonly prescribed blood pressure drugs. “In the pantheon of physical activity, aerobic exercising is the best for blood pressure,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz.

They increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, constrict blood vessels, and enlarge our pupils to help us think and move fast, explained Dr. Beniaminovitz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In the past, the stressful event was typically over pretty quickly—but today, relentless work demands, overbooked schedules, challenging relationships, and even social media have led to an epidemic of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a61928322/mediterranean-diet-lowers-stress-levels-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a61928322/mediterranean-diet-lowers-stress-levels-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chronic stress" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; stress&lt;/a&gt;, which triggers the same release of stress hormones. But unlike our ancestral past, there’s often no reprieve—it’s constant—and thus, blood pressure may remain elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.0"&gt;BP fix: Find your zen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity is one of the most effective ways to reduce levels of stress hormones and minimize their impact on blood pressure, said Dr. Beniaminovitz. Mindfulness practices like deep breathing, meditation, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g30417941/best-yoga-stretches/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g30417941/best-yoga-stretches/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="yoga" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, or even reading a book or listening to your favorite music, can also keep stress hormones in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You may also need to cut &lt;em data-node-id="32.1"&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; certain activities, like checking those work emails at all hours. “People have to get to know themselves and their triggers, and how they may be able to remove themselves from situations that increase stress and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a22502279/anxiety-disorder-symptoms-signs/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a22502279/anxiety-disorder-symptoms-signs/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anxiety" data-node-id="32.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Phillips.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-feeling-lonely-or-socially-isolated" data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;5.

Not to mention, chronic loneliness is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a20465433/surprising-depression-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/life/a20465433/surprising-depression-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576256&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41440-024-01856-8" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-024-01856-8" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research has shown" data-vars-ga-product-id="ae7f4b85-a181-471f-944e-b1f3defbff6c" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="34.3" data-href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-024-01856-8" data-product-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-024-01856-8" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576256&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41440-024-01856-8" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"d55f98dc-cbd6-4679-ae11-243969f8c772","metadata":null,"network":{"name":"Skimlinks"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/z8nc/nature-depressive-symptoms-and-the-development"}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Taku Inoue" data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="66eccc76-5bbe-4ee3-b5e0-193f06b066b0" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Taku Inoue" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.3.0"&gt;research has shown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a correlation between depression and the subsequent development of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="35" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.0"&gt;BP fix: Make plans—and see them through.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“We are social beings and we need a certain amount of social interaction to function optimally,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. But if the idea of putting yourself out there seems impossible, start small. Send a friend a quick DM to say you’re thinking of them and see where things go. Combine physical activity &lt;em data-node-id="36.1"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; social time by committing to a weekly Saturday morning yoga class with a pal. Want to make &lt;em data-node-id="36.3"&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; friends?

But the biggest sleep-related cause of hypertension is &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26540024/sleep-disorders/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26540024/sleep-disorders/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&lt;/a&gt;—a disorder that causes someone to stop breathing for brief periods of time while sleeping due to an obstruction of their upper airway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“With higher obesity rates, more and more people are developing OSA,” said Dr. Phillips. “This leads to broken sleep and decreased oxygen levels in the body, and part of the body’s response is to increase blood pressure.” In fact, it’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22444" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22444" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="half of people with hypertension also suffer from OSA" data-node-id="39.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="39.1.0"&gt;half of people with hypertension also suffer from OSA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

You have a family history of hypertension. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Genes do play &lt;em data-node-id="49.1"&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; role in high blood pressure, which is why younger people in seemingly great health can still be diagnosed with hypertension, said Dr. Phillips. However, more often than not, it’s also likely that people with a family history of high blood pressure share common environments (similar diets, similar sedentary lifestyles, etc.) that increase their risk—and these are very much modifiable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Our genes also interact with the environment and we can influence them by the choices we make,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. “While lifestyle changes may not help you in &lt;em data-node-id="50.1"&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; developing high blood pressure if you have a strong family history, optimal lifestyle will aid in delaying the onset of blood pressure and the need for early medications. Instead of developing high blood pressure in your 30s or 40s, with optimal diet and lifestyle you may delay the onset of high blood pressure to your late 60s or 70s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="51" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="51.0"&gt;BP fix: Implement the tips above!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s no magic bullet, but if you have a strong family history, that’s even more reason to implement all of the dietary and lifestyle recommendations above—eat whole foods, move your body more, manage stress—and get your blood pressure checked regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:28:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wUkY4WHFzZ3ZKOWdMSlhyWkpiQkNrQ29NMnlTOEJJUGk5eHphU2hpRUtvb0s5bFVBbWRYZnI2QURxeFNSYXdxODRhUWZ1MXViRGNLcmRmenhwaHB1NGZ2ak10cVlzVVVJdkZub0YzeDdoV1pWQ0ozQURBOA</guid></item><item><title>更新：俄亥俄州山顶俄亥俄州Hi-Point职业中心发生两起三车相撞事故</title><link>https://www.peakofohio.com/featured-news/three-vehicle-crash-closes-route-47-at-ohio-hi-point-career-center/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Peak of Ohio</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:10:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPZEU5UG96NnV6YU8tNUN2UFBBbkJRUFY2S0JabDBEY0Y0ZUJZS3ctel9NSXBtNEtpVXJVal80N242ZDFjaFozQjhaUndaN0VHSHZMTHlWYlNlZDY3ZzVpbFpyeUMxT3JIa3Z2c1NIOTl1ZVVleGFMVVUwaE5SWjhRdGE1SmJqSFp0RDNGbDdXQ3cyZEpVVGY0MGlSNGJLbDl3bzE2VDRaOWZKakRP</guid></item><item><title>改变生活方式，降低患痴呆症的风险-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/try-this/simple-lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Episode_episode-description__mlBrI Episode_episode-content-wrapper__8Q2oZ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we age, we can develop a higher risk for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Cristina also speaks with neurologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=MPARKE2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Monica Parker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Emory University School of Medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read more about Baker’s work with the U.S. POINTER study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/us-pointer/home.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more on Parker’s work, visit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthyaging.emory.edu/ehbs/#top" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the Emory Healthy Brain Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more on ways to reduce your risk of dementia, check out some of The Post’s reporting:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acquisition/?s_l=OFFSITE_PODCAST&amp;amp;p=s_v&amp;amp;s_dt=yearly&amp;amp;utm_source=apple-podcast&amp;amp;utm_medium=acq-nat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podcast-subs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Subscribe to The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or connect your subscription in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/channel/washington-post-audio/id6442482183" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:01:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNc1NDSlRCMFFXOV9wRnhrTE5xVkNhNDYza0tOYkxZWG1aU3M2V3pyWVBYdnhmMFRFVk8xeUZTWlRVSGZic3pXa245ZUZmRGFyZ2NTYTFvZl9rZkVHVTUteHFiSDZ1bUJnUV9ZNG1admc5V1N5bGc4TmRtLUR2MWZZUlRmNU5zaTY1N2lRb21wMUlxWjZGVWJ1YlpGaFlXRDZ5QkpjZkZTUDFHUQ</guid></item><item><title>服用GLP-1s在工作中取得成功-切入点</title><link>https://www.thecut.com/article/taking-ozempic-workplace.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

Decades of research shows that people who are thinner tend to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.94.3.468"&gt;&lt;em&gt;make more money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021470813182"&gt;&lt;em&gt;attain higher-status jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, particularly women in white-collar workplaces. It’s understandable, then, that people would put a lot of effort (and money) into how they look in order to maintain a professional edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fields where personal appearance is prized, they’ve become commonplace, if not normal. But at what cost? Here, three people in different industries who are taking the drugs for professional purposes — and feel conflicted about it — share their experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ax578000z3b780u92irpc@published" data-word-count="8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Ann, 45, director at a bank in Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The frat-house culture is real. And most of the women who work in this industry fit the same mold. They look like hot, thin sorority girls in business attire. Maybe things have changed in the past ten or 20 years — they probably used to be worse — but the truth is, there’s a ton of pressure to look a certain way. There’s no open discrimination against people for being fat or ugly; you just don’t see any in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnu003z3b78nb0q17e8@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;I started taking a GLP-1 about a year ago, after another woman I work with told me she was taking it. My first thought, when she told me, was, &lt;em&gt;Shit, I have to take this too if I don’t want to be the biggest girl at the office.&lt;/em&gt; I wish I could say I was taking it for my health, or because it made me feel better physically, but the truth is that I’m taking it because I’m afraid not to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnu00403b781gzbmpni@published" data-word-count="141"&gt;I remember the first time I realized that my weight could be a professional liability. I was working on a trading desk right out of college, almost 20 years ago, and during my first performance review, my manager told me that he’d received some comments on my professional attire and that I should review the employee handbook regarding dress code. He clearly felt really awkward about this, and I thought I was going to die of embarrassment. I knew the real issue was my weight. I always followed the dress code — I wore a suit every day — but I’d gained about 15 pounds that year and some of my clothes no longer fit well. I did those juice cleanses, which are obviously terrible for you, and managed to lose some of the weight. But it was a constant battle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnv00413b78h5707wrt@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;I’ve never been obese, but I’ve always been on the bigger side. I have the kind of metabolism where, if I don’t work out regularly and watch what I eat, I will go up a size immediately. My weight fluctuates a lot. A lot of people in my family are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnv00423b78u0eyvuy5@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;When I decided to start a GLP-1, I didn’t even know where to get it. I was too embarrassed to go to an actual doctor, and I was pretty sure they wouldn’t prescribe it to me anyway, because I wasn’t technically overweight. I wound up using one of those online telehealth platforms. You answer a bunch of questions and send a picture of yourself. The first time I went through the process, I answered all the questions honestly, and they wouldn’t prescribe me a GLP-1; they suggested some other weight-loss regimen. So I tried it again and lied about my weight and said it was higher, and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnw00433b78axoye2eb@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;I take Zepbound, and it is expensive — about $1,300 a month. The medication itself costs around $1,100 for four prefilled pens, and then I pay another $150 for a “membership” to the telehealth platform’s weight-loss program. I could probably save that $150 by finding a doctor who would prescribe it to me, but I don’t know where to start with that. And doing it online is just much easier, so it’s worth it to me. I haven’t told anyone I’m doing it, not even my husband. He’s the kind of person who never struggles with his weight, so I don’t think he’d understand, and he’d probably be worried about me. I’m kind of hoping that a pill or something will come out that I can take instead, and at that point I’ll tell him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnx00443b78knnc8rzg@published" data-word-count="161"&gt;I feel really conflicted about the fact that I’ve been doing this. Yes, I’ve lost weight — about 20 pounds — and it’s a huge relief to not have to worry about whether my pants are going to fit. I can’t overstate how great it is to take that piece of stress out of my life. In that sense, it’s a miracle. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/ozempic-side-effects.html"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; — the usual ones you hear about. I also hate that I feel like I have to do this to maintain what’s considered a professional appearance. I’m well aware that by making myself fit this mold, I’m perpetuating the problem. This should not be normal, and it goes against my values. But increasingly, living your values seems like a huge privilege, and sometimes you have to do a cost-benefit analysis. I wouldn’t get fired for being fat, obviously, but would I get the same amount of professional respect? I don’t really want to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnx00453b78harf1mkx@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I’ve lumped this expense into the same category of self-maintenance that’s pretty normal, at least for women in my industry: Botox, covering up gray hair, manicures. I do all that stuff, too. It’s ironic, because the older and more experienced I get, the more money I make. I got a big promotion last year and I’m proud of that; I know I deserved it. But also, I have to spend more money to look the part. It’s ridiculous, and I resent it.&lt;/p&gt;

That wasn’t really an issue for me until I had kids. I had twins about four years ago, and it was hard for me to lose the baby weight. I had postpartum issues and I struggled a lot when my babies were little. I didn’t go back to work for two years. If I’m being honest, part of what kept me from wanting to go back was that I was still about 40 pounds heavier than I was before, and I was really insecure about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbg004j3b78ytubsuxv@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;About two years ago, when Ozempic was getting a lot of attention, I figured I would try it. I was going through a divorce, and I really needed to go back to work, financially. I asked my doctor about it and he said he couldn’t prescribe them to me because I wasn’t prediabetic or obese. But then I figured out it was pretty easy to get a semaglutide prescription online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbg004k3b7850wnm1va@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;It really did work. I lost most of the weight within six months. Now I take a lower dose to maintain. When I was taking a higher dose, I always had to plan around what I was doing that week — if I was going out to dinner with clients, for instance, I wouldn’t take it the day before. I learned that the hard way. The first six months, I spent a lot of time in the bathroom. I also &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/glp-1-hair-loss-causes-and-treatments.html"&gt;experienced a lot of hair loss&lt;/a&gt;. It’s mostly grown back, but not the way it was.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought it would make me feel better, mentally, because I’d been so depressed about my weight. But if anything, it was the opposite. I felt even more lethargic and just kind of blah all the time, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. I wound up going on an antidepressant, which helped. But now I’m trapped in this cycle where I have to keep taking these medications just to maintain. It feels fake. Like, where do I get off here? Do I just have to keep doing this until I retire?&lt;/p&gt;

It’s created this new playing field, and if I want to stay competitive, I need to keep up. No one talks about it, at least to me, but it’s pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbh004n3b78tyqhgm3m@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;Financially, it’s not cheap. I spend about $500 a month on it, which is a lot less than I used to. I get the vials instead of the prefilled pens, which saves money, and I take a lower dosage. But I’m making good money in my career right now, so I tell myself it kind of shakes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbh004o3b78am7j1e7k@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;I don’t like that my weight affects me so much. I wish it didn’t. But it does. And if I’m going to provide for my family and advance professionally, I need to keep it in check. I’m trying not to overthink it too much right now.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ayoyd00323b78hypuls5m@published" data-word-count="8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Andrew, 38, interior designer based in New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ayrpb003i3b7893mqc186@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;I have always carried more weight than I wanted to, and probably more than was healthy. And when I have gone to various extreme measures to lose weight, through restrictive eating or tons of working out, I’m miserable. When I’m not restricting myself, I feel generally healthier in the head. So when these new weight-loss medications became available, it seemed like something worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j08004z3b78ohcobfu0@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;I’m not a newscaster or a model or anything, but as an interior designer, aesthetics are your whole business. I do a lot of interfacing with clients, and it’s important that I look a certain way. Also, in our end of the market, we run around with the &lt;em&gt;Über-&lt;/em&gt;wealthy, and obviously there is a huge emphasis on appearance and looks and weight in this realm of the world. Finally, in this era, you are supposed to present yourself and sell yourself as part of your product. It’s not just about your work — the face behind the design is part of your brand, so to speak. There are a lot of industry events, there’s a lot of photography. There’s social media. All of this puts pressure on men and women in the industry to look good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0900503b78nhlp70mc@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;I first got the idea to try a GLP-1 through a friend. She was probably 50 pounds heavier than she wanted to be, and she was having a hard time losing the weight. She talked about wanting to try it, and it was so nice to have an open and nonjudgmental conversation about wanting to lose weight. So I talked to my doctor and he thought it was a good idea. I didn’t qualify for insurance to cover it, because I didn’t have a diabetes issue or anything. And I was not interested in trying to get a discount for fake reasons. I felt morally that was wrong, and I was happy to pay the full price. I’m privileged to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00513b78ywy4bya7@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;I ramped up the dosage gradually, but I did have a fair number of side effects. Mine were pretty much GI related. I’d never had motion sickness before in my life, but suddenly I had to take Zofran for it, which helped. Within about six months, I lost about 25, 30 pounds. So I decided to go off of it to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00523b78ifvdg8p3@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;I went off of it for six months, and in those six months, I never gained more than a couple of pounds. I wasn’t doing anything different. I was very, very aware of not depriving myself. So I was really just trying to roll with it. Then my weight did start to creep up, so I went back on it for a few months again. Now I sort of use it ad hoc. I’ll do it for a month and then take a month off, or I’ll stretch a month’s dose over two or three months. I see myself having it in my life for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00533b7861hlioo2@published" data-word-count="30"&gt;It’s expensive — about a thousand dollars a month. But $12,000 a year, in the grand scheme of living in Manhattan, isn’t unmanageable, especially if it makes a big positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00543b782fjt023w@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I don’t know, specifically, if losing weight has helped me professionally. But I definitely have a different sense of confidence in myself now than I did before. I put a lot of my life on social media, and it’s nice to feel good about how you look. Now my spouse is on it too. I’m open with everyone about it. I’ll say, “I’m on the shot.” The only people I wouldn’t tell are my parents. I think they would consider it lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

Some have taken it to the extreme. They look skeletal, like bobbleheads. I’m trying to have a healthy relationship with it.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than using nanoparticles as passive carriers, the researchers designed bioactive nanoparticles that function as "supramolecular drugs." The treatment focuses on restoring the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the vascular checkpoint that maintains the brain's internal environment. By repairing this interface, the animals showed a reversal of Alzheimer's pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain consumes about 20% of the body's energy in adults and as much as 60% in children. That energy arrives through an exceptionally dense vascular network in which each neuron is supplied by its own capillary. With roughly one billion capillaries, the brain relies on healthy vasculature to sustain function and resist disease. These observations reinforce how vascular health connects to conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's, where damage to the vascular system is closely associated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood-brain barrier function and removal of waste proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBB is a cellular and physiological shield that separates brain tissue from circulating blood, helping block pathogens and toxins. The researchers showed that by acting on a specific mechanism, harmful "waste proteins" produced in the brain can cross this barrier and be cleared into the bloodstream. In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β (Aβ) is the primary waste protein, and its buildup disrupts neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team worked with mouse models engineered to overproduce Aβ and to develop marked cognitive decline that mirrors Alzheimer's features. The animals received three doses of the supramolecular drugs, followed by regular monitoring. "Only 1h after the injection we observed a reduction of 50-60% in Aβ amount inside the brain" explains Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and PhD student at the University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic outcomes were the most notable. Across several behavioral and memory tests conducted over months, animals were assessed at different disease stages. In one example, a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60-year-old human) was treated with the nanoparticles and evaluated 6 months later. By 18 months of age (comparable to a 90-year-old human), its behavior matched that of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring vasculature to restart brain self-clearing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance. What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels," said Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC, Principal Investigator of the Molecular Bionics Group and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's, a key breakdown occurs in the brain's natural clearance process for toxic species such as Aβ. Under normal conditions, the protein LRP1 serves as a molecular gatekeeper. It recognizes Aβ, binds it via ligands, and helps shuttle it across the BBB into the bloodstream for removal. The system is delicate. If LRP1 binds too much Aβ too tightly, transport becomes congested and LRP1 itself is degraded within BBB cells, reducing the number of available carriers. If binding is too weak, the transport signal is insufficient. Either scenario leads to Aβ accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supramolecular drugs act as a reset switch. By imitating LRP1 ligands, they bind Aβ, traverse the BBB, and trigger the removal of toxic species. As this process resumes, the vasculature regains its natural waste-clearing role and returns toward normal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision-engineered nanoparticles and receptor control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, nanoparticles operate as therapeutic agents in their own right. Built through a bottom-up molecular engineering strategy, they combine tightly controlled size with a defined number of surface ligands to create a multivalent platform with highly specific interactions at cellular receptors. By engaging receptor trafficking at the cell membrane, they provide a new way to modulate receptor activity. This precision supports efficient Aβ clearance and helps rebalance the vascular system that safeguards brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This therapeutic concept points toward future clinical strategies that address the vascular contribution to Alzheimer's disease and aim to improve patient outcomes. "Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood-brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer's pathology," concludes Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at the Molecular Bionics group from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The project brought together the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC), West China Hospital of Sichuan University, West China Xiamen Hospital of Sichuan University, University College London, the Xiamen Key Laboratory of Psychoradiology and Neuromodulation, University of Barcelona,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy in California may have saved his father from a deadly returning cancer by becoming one of if not the world’s youngest stem cell donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9-year-old Stephen Mondek from Torrance loves playing catch with his dad, Nick, who himself loves nothing more than being a father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 Mr. Mondek was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, and had to be treated rapidly with an injection of donor stem cells from his older brother who was a perfect genetic match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went into remission but the cancer came back “ferociously fast,” and Mondek’s only option was that he had to find another stem cell donor. This form of leukemia affects the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, but an injection of stem cells can form the basis of a new immune arsenal that can locate and attack the leukemia tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search through the National Bone Marrow Registry failed to turn up a match, but remembering the case of a friend of his, Mondek went into Cedars-Sinai Cancer center in April with a question to his doctors. He was remembering the case of a friend of his who received a lifesaving stem cell donation from his 18-year-old son to cure lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As my doctor came in the room, I said, ‘Could a 9-year-old who’s 70 pounds give us enough stem cells?’” Mondek &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/nbc-nightly-news-a-9-year-old-son-saves-his-fathers-life-by-donating-stem-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said to NBC Nightly News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Paquette, the clinical director of the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Transplant Program at Cedars-Sinai Cancer, confirmed that Stephen Mondek who turned 10 back in August, was a possible donor. A child receives half of their DNA from each parent, so Stephen would naturally be a half-match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the story itself, Cedars-Sinai &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/youngest-cedars-sinai-stem-cell-donor-helps-doctors-treat-dads-leukemia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that Paquette said a half-match might make the transplant more effective. A half-matched immune system might more easily recognize and kill the cancer cells in Mondek’s bone marrow, and transplants from younger donors tend to be most successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The conversation with Stephen was pretty simple,” Mondek said. “I said, ‘Hey, Buddy, Dad’s sick and they need someone to give me stem cells, and they want to know if you want to get tested to see if you can do it.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen’s response: “When do we go?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to make my dad’s cancer go away, and if I was sick, I would think he would do the same thing for me,” Stephen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCER BEING BEATEN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="After Childhood Cancer Diagnosis, Donor Bone Marrow from Little Sister Sends it into Remission" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/after-childhood-cancer-diagnosis-donor-bone-marrow-from-little-sister-sends-it-into-remission/" rel="bookmark"&gt;After Childhood Cancer Diagnosis, Donor Bone Marrow from Little Sister Sends it into Remission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After confirming that Stephen was a suitable match, he had the procedure explained to him so that he could give his own informed consent before visiting Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children’s Hospital for the donation that required general anesthesia. The stem cells were collected via a process of blood cycling over 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, Mondek underwent pre-donation chemotherapy to suppress his own immune system before eventually receiving the stem cells. After 6 weeks in the hospital, he was back home, but not before arriving in time to watch the final inning of Stephen’s little league game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stephen was very brave, and our team made sure everything went perfectly so that this young boy could help his father,” said Hoyoung Chung, DO, a critical care pediatrician at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He donated six million stem cells to save my life, so it’s not just an honor to call him my son, I’m proud to call him my hero,” Mondek &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/torrance-father-stem-cell-donation-9-year-old-son/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But RSV, the leading cause of infant hospitalization nationwide, presents particular risk for the youngest babies, a major reason health experts recommend pregnant women either get vaccinated near their delivery date or immunize their newborns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the perfect time to get your vaccine for RSV if you have never gotten one,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV can spread through coughs or sneezes but also by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;touching&lt;/a&gt; a contaminated surface, such as a door handle, and then touching your face before washing your hands, health officials warn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week ending Oct. 11, about 1.2% of emergency room visits nationwide among infants younger than 1 were due to RSV — up from 0.4% a month earlier, according to data &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pophive.org/respiratory-diseases/respiratory-syncytial-virus#viral-activity-by-age" target="_blank"&gt;posted by PopHIVE&lt;/a&gt;, a project led by the Yale School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An RSV wave is starting to take hold,” epidemiologists Katelyn Jetelina and Hannah Totte wrote in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/rsv-season-measles-snap-benefits-jetelina-the-dose?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;amp;publication_id=281219&amp;amp;post_id=177224248&amp;amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;r=5mkemj&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; Your Local Epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV can be dangerous for infants, older adults and people with certain medical conditions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV can cause pneumonia, as well as a severe inflammation of the lungs’ small airways, known as bronchiolitis, the California Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, about 2% to 3% of young infants will be &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7241e1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; for RSV &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/infants-young-children/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;annually&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. Most children who are hospitalized for acute respiratory disease caused by RSV were previously healthy, according to a study published by the journal &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/132/2/e341/31332/Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-Associated?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may require oxygen or intravenous fluid or even be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the flu and COVID-19, there are no antiviral drugs to treat RSV once infection sets in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the combined &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; of respiratory illness from RSV, flu and COVID-19 is considered “very low” in California, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “we are starting to see the beginnings of respiratory virus season,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Santa Clara County, Northern California’s most populous, are already reporting “medium” levels of RSV in the wastewater of San José, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is exactly the time to get vaccinated if you haven’t already — “especially before respiratory virus activity potentially increases later,” said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the Orange County health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV immunizations are recommended for pregnant women between 32 and 36 weeks of gestational age — about  one to two months before their estimated delivery date — as well as for everyone age 75 and up and those age 50 to 74 with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, weakened immune systems, asthma or heart disease. Vaccines are also recommended for individuals who live in a nursing home or long-term-care facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman wasn’t vaccinated against RSV, officials recommend her infant get immunized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV vaccinations are fairly new, being introduced in 2023. There are now three &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7332e1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; — Moderna’s mResvia, Pfizer’s Abrysvo and GSK’s Arexvy. All three can be used for older adults, but only the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pfizer vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is available for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants were also able to get &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-06/rsv-season-may-have-already-begun-cdc-warns"&gt;immunized&lt;/a&gt; starting that year through monoclonal antibodies, which aren’t technically vaccines but function similarly in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults who already received an RSV vaccination generally don’t need to get another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of those vaccines followed a particularly brutal 2022-23 respiratory virus season when California was slammed by a hospital-straining “tripledemic” of RSV, flu and COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the RSV shots, flu and COVID vaccinations are generally recommended ahead of every fall-and-winter virus respiratory season. Older adults, those age 65 and up, can get the COVID vaccination every six months, according to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can get the RSV, flu and COVID vaccinations all during the same visit to a healthcare provider, Chinsio-Kwong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving all eligible vaccines at once is considered best practice, as it helps avoid missed opportunities due to scheduling challenges,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual routine flu vaccines are recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for COVID, a vaccine can be given to anyone who wants one. The California Department of Public Health specifically &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/publichealth4all/vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the shots for everyone age 65 and up, babies age 6 months to 23 months, children and teenagers who have never been vaccinated, and people with certain health risk factors and those in close contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also recommends pregnant women get the COVID vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After concerns earlier this season about how difficult it might be to get COVID vaccinations, pharmacists and California health officials now say securing the shots is relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy arose in the late summer amid confusing guidance coming from agencies overseen by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has disparaged vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a period during which the Food and Drug Administration had belatedly approved COVID-19 vaccines only for those age 65 and up and younger people with underlying health conditions. An unprecedented delay in the CDC issuing its own recommendations had the effect of snarling vaccinations for many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some states, that meant people were being turned away from getting the COVID vaccine at their local pharmacy, including seniors, even as a late summer surge was raging. And at one point, the powerful CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-19/cdc-committee-votes-on-covid-19"&gt;nearly&lt;/a&gt; recommended the COVID vaccine be available by prescription only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 6, acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill officially lifted the agency’s recommendation that adults under age 65 get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead that doing so should be based on “individual-based decision-making” in consultation with health professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, “patients can go into the pharmacy” and can have conversations on whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine with a professional, Allison Hill, a director of professional affairs for the American Pharmacists Assn., said during a recent webinar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California also recently clarified state law to make sure that pharmacists can independently administer the COVID vaccination, according to Dr. Erica Pan, director of the state Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPQXVoRWFsU3doRmtLanBxaXhWS2ZpLVZRMzNWMmtmb3ZPYzNWcE1ZZEo2Y3lNU1hhUlAxQllUQ0JYLVFieHVRSzlnUXF5R3FraG5DN1hxSVNHbk80TXItdWVoSGc4WDQ0R2dXanhxdFhmRkNldUJOaUpELUgtYmQ3NWd5R2FnOWtpRVJ2TXdDSUJfaVlWM3dBUFZTMGxLZEplWDlFa1hsbDVERWtjaHVyWndpakhoQjQ4Qjhlbk1memhTeU90dHhyN0w0Rkp1dHZtT1R2M1JPbFRNN1AxN2FF</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州医生因踝关节手术和住院而支付了$ 64,000的账单-科罗拉多太阳报</title><link>https://coloradosun.com/2025/10/30/colorado-doctor-tripped-up-by-64k-bill-for-ankle-surgery-and-hospital-stay/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julie Appleby&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital, Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shaken Hughes was examined in the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bruising, a deep cut on her knee, and a broken ankle. Physicians recommended immediate surgical repair, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They said: ‘You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. We need to take you to the OR to wash it out and make sure there’s no infection,’” she said. “As a clinician, I thought, ‘Yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was taken to the operating room in the early evening, then admitted to the hospital overnight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A friend took her home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-medical-procedure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Medical Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cleaned the cut on her right knee, which had hit her car’s dashboard, and realigned a broken bone in her right ankle, stabilizing it with metal screws. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$63,976.35, charged by the hospital — which was not in-network with the insurance plan she got through her job — for the surgery and overnight stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-documentcloud wp-block-embed-documentcloud"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-problem-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem: Should I Stay or Should I Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hughes’ insurer, Anthem, fully covered the nearly $2,400 ambulance ride and some smaller radiology charges from the ER but denied the surgery and overnight stay charges from the out-of-network hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage,” Hughes said. “Just to stay there overnight. It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Insurers have broad power to determine &lt;a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/consumer-health-insurance-what-is-medical-necessity.pdf"&gt;whether care is medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; — that is, what is needed for treatment, diagnosis, or relief. And that decision affects whether and how much they will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;

(Rachel Woolf for KFF Health News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. “The information we have does not show you have these or other severe problems,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Hughes, the notion that she should have left the hospital was “ludicrous.” Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy’s benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show “safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem’s agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of “comprehensive, complex medical care” that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes’ ankle surgery was medically necessary,” Snooks wrote. “However, because the ankle surgery was bundled with the inpatient admission, the entire claim was denied.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn’t shielded by the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/no-surprises-understand-your-rights-against-surprise-medical-bills"&gt;No Surprises Act&lt;/a&gt;, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost,” said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. “But the No Surprises Act is not going to override the normal medical necessity determination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight “observation” stay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generally, that’s when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. Rather than being tied to the stay’s duration, the designation mainly reflects the intensity of care. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/skilled-nursing-facility-care#:~:text=You%20may%20not,for%20more%20information."&gt;any care needed in a nursing home&lt;/a&gt; if the patient was not first formally admitted to a &lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/11-years-of-the-two-midnight-rule-how-a-controversial-policy-is-shaping-medicare-and-hospital-admissions-in-2024/#:~:text=The%20length%20of,patient%E2%80%99s%20financial%20responsibility."&gt;hospital for at least three days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a classic battle between providers and insurers as to what bucket a claim falls in,” Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-resolution"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a physician and a director of a health policy center at the University of Colorado, Hughes is a savvier-than-usual policyholder. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer’s human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/send-us-your-medical-bills/"&gt;reached out to KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had “downgraded the level of care” the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility “deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her.” The hospital had “prematurely” and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After a careful review of Ms. Hughes’ situation,” Quale continued, “we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes’ bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for “outpatient care services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. The insurer paid the hospital nearly $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-takeaway"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as “post-stabilization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;stable enough to travel&lt;/a&gt; to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;to sign a consent form&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important that if they give you some kind of letter to sign that you read that letter very carefully, because that letter might give them your permission to get some big bills,” Hoadley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital’s billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her advice is to quickly and aggressively question insurance denials once they are received, including by asking for your case to be escalated to the insurer’s and hospital’s leadership. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was calling family,” Hughes said, “alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/tag/bill-of-the-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellbeing/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post’s Well+Being&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

Now, scientists have discovered that this traditional plant may hold remarkable healing potential. Researchers from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-94570.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have found that compounds extracted from henna (Lawsonia inermis) could help treat liver fibrosis, a dangerous condition caused by the build-up of scar tissue in the liver. This scarring, often linked to alcohol abuse or fatty liver disease, can lead to liver failure or cancer if untreated. The discovery marks a major step toward developing a natural, plant-based therapy that may not only halt but possibly reverse liver damage, offering new hope to millions suffering from chronic liver diseases worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Henna dye reveals its potential to reverse fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is the result of long-term injury or inflammation of the liver. When the liver becomes damaged from excessive alcohol use, fatty liver disease, or viral infections such as hepatitis, it tries to heal itself. However, this repeated healing process often leads to the production of fibrous scar tissue, which gradually replaces healthy liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 easy exercises that improve liver health within a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this scarring reduces the liver’s ability to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate that 3–4 per cent of the world’s population suffers from advanced liver fibrosis. Despite its prevalence, current medical treatments mainly focus on controlling the underlying cause rather than reversing the scarring itself. This is why the new findings from Osaka are being seen as potentially revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osaka study reveals henna’s power against fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team at Osaka Metropolitan University developed a chemical screening system capable of identifying substances that can directly target hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) — specialised liver cells responsible for maintaining structural integrity. Under normal conditions, HSCs help with tissue repair and vitamin A storage. However, when overactivated by chronic liver injury, they begin producing collagen excessively, leading to fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this advanced system, scientists discovered that Lawsone, the primary pigment in henna can inhibit the activation of these cells. This means that the compound can potentially halt or reverse the fibrotic process at its root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the henna compound worked in laboratory trials&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, researchers administered Lawsone to mice with induced liver fibrosis. The results were striking. The treated mice showed a reduction in major fibrosis markers, including YAP, αSMA, and COL1A proteins known to indicate the severity of liver scarring. Additionally, the researchers observed a rise in cytoglobin, a protein linked to antioxidant activity in hepatic stellate cells. This suggested that the cells were returning to their normal, healthy state, rather than remaining in their activated, fibrogenic form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in the scientific journal Biomedicine &amp;amp; Pharmacotherapy, point to the potential reversal of liver fibrosis something modern medicine has so far been unable to achieve effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osaka study advances henna’s potential as a liver-healing drug&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Atsuko Daikoku from Osaka Metropolitan University’s Graduate School of Medicine, the next stage of research involves developing a drug delivery system that can transport Lawsone directly to activated hepatic stellate cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently working on a system capable of delivering these drugs precisely to the affected cells,” Dr Daikoku explained. “By controlling fibroblast activity, including HSCs, we could potentially limit or even reverse the effects of fibrosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, this could lead to the first treatment that not only halts fibrosis but also repairs the liver, giving patients a chance at complete recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the causes of liver fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibrosis is not a disease in itself but a response to ongoing liver injury. The main causes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A growing global health issue linked to obesity, diabetes, and poor diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcoholic liver disease: Caused by years of excessive alcohol consumption, which inflames and damages liver cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Viral hepatitis (B and C): Long-term infections that continuously injure the liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autoimmune hepatitis and iron overload: Conditions that cause inflammation or metabolic imbalance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biliary obstruction: Blocked bile ducts that lead to liver inflammation and scarring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, the body’s natural healing process turns against itself — producing too much scar tissue and reducing liver efficiency over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Liver fibrosis symptoms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges in treating liver fibrosis is that it develops silently. In its early stages, there are often no noticeable symptoms, making diagnosis difficult until the disease has progressed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the liver becomes more scarred, symptoms may start to appear, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent fatigue and weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or digestive discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jaundice — yellowing of the skin and eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluid build-up in the legs or abdomen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating or mental confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time these warning signs emerge, liver function is often severely impaired, underscoring the urgent need for treatments that can repair existing damage such as those being developed from henna-derived compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could henna revolutionise liver disease treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If further studies confirm the effectiveness of Lawsone, it could mark the beginning of a new era in liver disease treatment. Unlike current therapies that focus only on prevention or symptom management, Lawsone-based drugs could actually reverse the damage, allowing the liver to heal.

Even though protein absolutely deserves a top spot in a well-balanced diet—it’s essential for &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/new-rules-of-protein"&gt;building and repairing muscle&lt;/a&gt;, supporting recovery, and preserving lean mass as we age—but it’s often treated like the whole story. In reality&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to actually powering training performance, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/S12970-017-0177-8"&gt;adequate carbs&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, and a consistent plan are the major contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, strength and conditioning specialist, and nutrition coach, I eat my fair share of protein and recommend it to clients, but I don’t love paying extra for protein bars or shakes when the consequences of substituting them for balanced meals chip away at performance and diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the protein craze taking a firm grasp of social media feeds, fast-food menus, and grocery carts, I think it’s important to examine what people truly need, where fortified products can help in real life, and where they slide into pricey ultra-processed convenience with a health halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Driving the Protein Boom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though protein-boosted foods are cropping up more now than ever, diets where a single nutrient becomes shorthand for “better choices” have been around since the 1920s, according to advertising and food historian &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/expert/elizabeth-nelson"&gt;Elizabeth Nelson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein craze really took off in the 1980s thanks to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://news.uoregon.edu/content/decades-hype-turned-protein-multibillion-dollar-industry"&gt;Atkins Diet&lt;/a&gt;, which pushed fat and protein with minimal carbs. The low-carb era made a simple case that protein is “good” and carbohydrates are “bad,” a framing that stuck because it let people eat indulgent foods and still feel virtuous, Nelson explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the protein frenzy is part of a bigger trend centering on “wellness” and longevity as ideal goals. In uncertain times, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10213393/"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; people often gravitate toward health-control behaviors, so focusing on diet and well-being has become a way for many to &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2023-07025-001"&gt;regain control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consuming Too Much Protein Can Backfire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a single macronutrient becomes the darling of your dinner plate, it can mean tradeoffs—some that are even counterproductive, especially if you’re choosing packaged protein-added foods over whole sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance Drops When You Cut Carbs to Boost Protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seek protein in part because of its performance and recovery-boosting prowess, but there’s a caveat. If protein is prioritized over carbs, performance and recovery will suffer, especially if your preferred activities demand a lot of energy. If you already get adequate protein, pushing above your usual targets or tacking &lt;span&gt;on protein during or post-workout fuel &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/S12970-017-0177-8"&gt;doesn’t improve endurance performance&lt;/a&gt; when you’re getting enough carbs; the main benefit of protein during long efforts is reduced&lt;/span&gt; muscle damage and soreness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active people should focus on &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/carbs-maximize-endurance/"&gt;getting enough carbs&lt;/a&gt; to fuel performance, which looks different depending on goals. “Endurance athletes, like cross-country runners as an example, require a lot more carbs,” says &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://redbudpt.com/location/sand-springs-physical-therapy-redbud/#gallery-1"&gt;Jeffrey Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist, comparing them to athletes like football players, who must maintain more muscle mass, thus require more protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson recommends whole-food protein sources, partially because if you’re relying on protein-infused foods to power your training, you can end up depleted. “Most bars and ready-to-drinks will have some carbs, but a lot of them are now more focused on protein at the expense of carbs,” says sports dietitian &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://lemoynedolphins.com/staff-directory/jessica-garay-ph-d-rdn-fand-cscs/232#:~:text=Jessica%20is%20currently%20an%20Assistant,the%20Committee%20on%20Dietetic%20Registration."&gt;Jessica Garay&lt;/a&gt;, a nutritionist and a sports dietetics specialist. This leaves you feeling depleted ahead of your next workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protein-Fortified Snacks Are Considered Ultra-Processed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more than a bit ironic that the war on processed foods is in full force while protein-added goods are booming. Bars, protein waters, cereals, and many ready-to-drink (RTD) shakes may look sporty and health-focused, but at their core, they’re industrial recipes built from &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11920265/"&gt;whey isolates (purified whey protein) and additives&lt;/a&gt; such as flavorings and sugars for better taste, which makes them ultra-processed foods (UPF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When active people rely on protein snacks packed with artificial sweeteners, they “feel bloated while training or even must make frequent trips to the bathroom, which impairs performance,” Jackson says. Not exactly training fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Ultra-Processed Foods Impact Health&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger picture here is that higher intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with poor health outcomes. For example, a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11621665/"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; links higher UPF intake with greater risks of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. In a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, adults ate about 500 more calories per day from carbs and fat when offered ultra-processed meals than when offered minimally processed meals, even though the menus were identical in terms of calories, macros, sugar, sodium, and fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Much Protein Do You Actually Need?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily allowance (RDA) is &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein"&gt;0.8 grams&lt;/a&gt; of protein per kilogram of body weight, which is a floor set to cover the needs of most healthy adults so they don’t become deficient. So if you weigh 150 pounds, you should aim to get 54 grams of protein each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most active people and athletes do better in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/S12970-017-0177-8"&gt;1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day&lt;/a&gt; lane (so that same 150 pound person would need to eat roughly 95 to 136 grams of protein each day), especially when training is regular and intense, the higher end is more practical during heavy training or if you’re in an energy deficit—eating fewer calories than you burn during weight loss—according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN). Garay suggests splitting protein into 20 to 40 grams per meal, choosing the higher end if you live in a larger body, are older, or have just trained intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nutritionist, I keep it simple. I’d rather see you eat yogurt and a sandwich after training than chug protein water (yes, that’s a thing) that shortchanges carbs. But I agree with Garay when she says, “Fed is best. A bar or RTD-protein shake is better than nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly, there’s no need to jump on this craze. If history holds, and it most definitely will, the pendulum will swing again, and we’ll be onto the next nutrition trend.&lt;/p&gt;

Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on berries is so exciting, both for breast cancer prevention and for survivors,” says Dr Mussallem. “For every two servings a week, they can reduce the risk of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/breast-cancer" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="breast cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and for survivors, lower the risk of dying from it by 25%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Purple sweet potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These purple sweet potatoes have about 150% more anthocyanins than berries,” she explains. “These powerful compounds help turn off tumour genes and activate tumour suppressor genes, essentially putting the brakes on cancer growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="embed_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some of the most powerful vegetables when it comes to breast cancer,” Dr Mussallem says. “They contain an enzyme called myrosinase, which helps the body absorb their cancer-fighting nutrients more effectively. They also help transform estrogen into a form that doesn’t stimulate cell growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Beans and other fibre-rich plant foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an amazing plant protein and you’re not just getting protein, you’re getting fibre,” she notes. “A massive study with 17 million person-years of data showed that fibre can reduce the risk of dying from any cause, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/heart-disease" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and even pancreatic cancer. Another review found that fibre can cut overall cancer risk by 22%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/30/original/Screenshot_2025-10-30_095639_1761798399163.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)" title="According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Soy and edamame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are very few foods that, if you ever got breast cancer, can actually reduce your risk of dying, and edamame is one of them,” says Dr Mussallem. “Soy is also protective for the prostate and may reduce the risk of lung cancer.

She shared, “Avoiding or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-reveals-no-caffeine-herbal-secret-for-glowing-skin-and-better-gut-health-101757415888018.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="limiting caffeine"&gt;limiting caffeine&lt;/a&gt; to one cup of coffee a day. Caffeine can dehydrate the skin, leading to a dull complexion and skin dryness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. “Consuming a variety of anti-inflammatory foods and drinks. I take 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil with dinner,” Sandipta added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/30/original/Gemini_Generated_Image_krcemokrcemokrce_1761802480997.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Sandipta spills her glow-inducing diet secrets, sharing game-changing eating habits that transformed her skin.

(Made using Gemini AI)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practice portion control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. She also said, “Never skip omega-3 fatty acids. I consume omega-3-rich foods such as fatty fish. Omega-3s help maintain skin elasticity and reduce inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. “Saying no to sugar at least 80 percent of the time! I limit my sugar intake to natural sources such as dates and honey, as high sugar intake contributes to skin inflammation,” Sandipta said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. Sandipta added, “Practicing &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/struggling-with-portion-control-watch-for-these-8-body-cues-that-mean-your-stomach-is-full-101757329991356.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="portion control"&gt;portion control&lt;/a&gt;. I’m mindful of my portion sizes and typically have my largest meal of the day as breakfast or lunch.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. She concluded, “Regulating my nervous system before meals. I take a few deep breaths before eating to reduce stress and cortisol, which can worsen outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want more tips?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amaranth is a whole grain with a nutty flavor that works in sweet and savory dishes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is packed with protein and fiber, contains magnesium and iron and is gluten-free. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try adding amaranth to a salad, energy bites, porridge or as a thickener for soups and stews. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If this is the first you’ve heard of amaranth, you may be surprised to learn that it has been around for thousands of years. Native to the Americas, amaranth was cultivated and consumed by the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Like quinoa, this ancient whole grain is often classified as a “pseudocereal” because it is a seed from a different plant species than traditional cereal grains like oats and barley. Yet, amaranth is prepared and eaten in the same way as common whole-grain cereals. Amaranth has a pleasant nutty flavor and thick consistency, making it ideal for sweet or savory porridges alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the word “whole” in whole grains means that all parts of the grain are left complete and intact, it also represents their well-rounded and robust nutrient content. In other words, a lot of goodness is packaged in the tiny morsels of whole grains. In addition to their carb content, some other nutrients include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and disease-fighting phytochemicals. Not to mention, some whole grains are packed with protein. And amaranth is a high-protein whole grain I love over the others. Let’s dive in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-i-love-amaranth"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why I Love Amaranth &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Loaded with Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amaranth is my go-to whole grain because it’s a plant-based protein powerhouse! One cup of cooked amaranth boasts an impressive 9 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike most grains, amaranth is a complete protein with a balanced composition of all nine essential amino acids, which are needed in sufficient amounts to build muscle, hormones, neurotransmitters and immune-supporting antibodies. But that’s not all. One study highlighted that amaranth seeds contain a protein peptide similar to lunasin, found in soybeans and known for helping prevent certain types of cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's Full of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I don’t know what I would do without whole grains. From the comfort and fullness they provide to their deliciousness, keeping a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of whole grains&lt;/a&gt; stocked in my pantry is nonnegotiable. Whole grains are not only a source of carbohydrates needed to fuel our body, they deliver so much more than that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the benefits of eating more whole grains is that the fiber isn’t stripped away like in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;their refined-grain counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;necessary nutrient&lt;/a&gt; that helps stabilize blood sugar levels, support digestive health and lower cholesterol levels. To reap these benefits, I aim for the recommendation to consume 25 grams of fiber daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By eating a half-cup of amaranth, I get 4 grams of dietary fiber—16% of the recommended intake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's a Great Source of Iron &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a mom and dietitian, my top priority is to ensure my family gets all the iron they need. Iron is a critical mineral for our red blood cells, allowing them to transport oxygen throughout our body. While meat is one of the most widely known sources of iron, plant-based foods, including amaranth, can also provide it. That’s why amaranth was one of the first whole grains I introduced to my little one. One cup of amaranth contains 5 milligrams of iron, which is 45% of the recommended intake for a 6-month-old baby (comparable to what fortified baby cereals contain!). That said, dietary iron comes in two forms: heme and nonheme, and our body can better absorb the former, found in animal-based foods. Yet, pairing plant-based foods, which deliver nonheme iron, with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like strawberries helps increase its absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's High in Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Minerals like magnesium may quickly become depleted due to high-stress levels and vice versa.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, my body &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;needs magnesium&lt;/a&gt; to perform essential functions like protein production, muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation and more. On those days when I feel more stressed than usual, I try to boost my magnesium intake. Fortunately, amaranth contains 160 mg of magnesium per cooked cup, a remarkable 38% of the Daily Value for the mineral.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's Gluten-Free &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At this point, is there anything that amaranth doesn’t contain? Actually, there is! Amaranth is one of the few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288100/gluten-free-foods-list/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gluten-free whole grains&lt;/a&gt;. Along with quinoa, buckwheat, teff, corn and rice, amaranth is an excellent option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amaranth is a versatile little grain that can be used in a variety of dishes. But before I whip up a pot of amaranth, I ensure I soak the whole grain overnight. Soaking whole grains improves digestion and enhances the body’s ability to absorb the key nutrients mentioned above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once soaked, my favorite way to prepare amaranth is to toss it into a pot of boiling water to create a delicious porridge. Topped with berries, sweetened with a touch of maple syrup and drizzled with almond butter, amaranth porridge has become a nutrient-dense staple in my household. I often describe the texture as a marriage between oatmeal and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if porridge isn’t your jam, you can also grind amaranth into a fine powder and use it to make protein-packed pancakes or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270874/gluten-free-morning-glory-blender-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muffins&lt;/a&gt;. You can even pop amaranth over dry heat to add to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249791/maple-nut-granola/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;homemade granola&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re looking for something a bit more savory, amaranth also makes for a great thickener in soups, stews and chili. The options are truly endless!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fun fact: Popped amaranth is traditionally used in Mexico to make honey- or agave-sweetened candies shaped into skulls to celebrate Dia de los Muertos.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although I like to rotate whole grains to make sure I eat different plant-based foods every week, I love eating amaranth more regularly. This high-protein whole grain is chock-full of nutrients and very versatile to use. Prepared as porridge or cooked into pancakes, amaranth is an excellent gluten-free option if you are looking to switch up your typical whole-grain intake.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

It’s now not quite zero, but is certainly greatly reduced, which is a huge relief for a woman who has seen breast cancer blaze through both sides of her family, affecting young female relatives on her mom’s side and an older male relative on her dad’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her mom, Michelle Hall, was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer when Anna was 5. Her mom was 33 at the time, and after undergoing radiation and chemotherapy, she was in remission for a year, then the cancer came back and she was told it was not survivable. When Anna was 9, her mother died. Michelle Hall was 37 years old and her husband Jim raised their two young daughters, later with the help of their stepmother after he remarried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="785" data-height="1024"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JFMH3KL4GJFAFKMMQHOMLQ476Q.jpeg?auth=79f9402670922b4ba7f19f86fdfccfa743964c0194eb19e5548a5906af9fd388&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1043" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JFMH3KL4GJFAFKMMQHOMLQ476Q.jpeg?auth=79f9402670922b4ba7f19f86fdfccfa743964c0194eb19e5548a5906af9fd388&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2086 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Michelle Hall with her daughter Anna in an old family photo. Michelle died when Anna was 9 due to breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Hall family photo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her grandfather on her dad’s side also succumbed to breast cancer, though he was older and breast cancer is less common in men than in women. Anna Hall can name other relatives who’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer and others who have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s been a looming shadow, she said. “I always grew up with a fear of it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among her childhood memories are watching her vibrant mom become terribly ill and weak, unable to do things with the husband and daughters she adored. Hall said she has always known she would reduce her own risk surgically if she’d inherited the danger. Once she learned she had, the question was when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was far less afraid of the surgery and recovery than she was of putting it off. But while she has been proactive in facing the risk, she’s also been busy launching a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-lifetime-of-vigilance" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A lifetime of vigilance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/ZLXR7ATZBBBAVH3E7PXH4Z2RJY.JPG?auth=0ae137b93d32fdb4acfc0816f7389fef90ccc5fde96f7046c4ec0a92487f00a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/ZLXR7ATZBBBAVH3E7PXH4Z2RJY.JPG?auth=0ae137b93d32fdb4acfc0816f7389fef90ccc5fde96f7046c4ec0a92487f00a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;An old family photo featuring Anna Hall, right, her biological mother, Michelle, and her little sister, Kirsten, is displayed at her family's home in Draper on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. Hall has a BRCA1 gene mutation, which can cause breast cancer, and has a family history of breast cancer with multiple deaths, including her biological mother; because of those factors, she decided to have a double mastectomy in August. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Isaac Hale, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The National Cancer Institute reports that “the risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer are markedly increased in people who inherit a harmful change in BRCA1 or BRCA2,” two genes with mutations closely tied to breast cancer risk. BRCA literally stands for “BReast CAncer gene.” Those with a mutation have increased risk of some other cancers, too, but that risk is less than for breast and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those with a “harmful change” in either BRCA gene “also tend to develop cancer at younger ages than people who do not have such a variant,” per the institute. The fact a person usually has only one copy of the gene with the variant is a good thing, but its protective benefits can be lost over the course of a lifetime, so risk of cancer is “markedly greater” than among those without any BRCA variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The institute reports that more than 60% of women who inherit a harmful variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer at some point. The risk for women in the general population is about 13%. And for those who develop breast cancer in one breast, the risk is significant for later breast cancer in the other breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The risk of breast cancer from a BRCA mutation is much less for men, at between 0.2% and 7.1% by age 70, but it happens. And it happened in the Hall family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So Hall got tested when she was 22 to see if she had inherited a BRCA mutation. She was attending Utah State University at the time and had the blood test done. She learned that she had inherited a BRCA 1 mutation. Because of her family history and her status as BRCA positive, as well as her breast tissue density, she and a specialist developed a vigilant monitoring plan. Dense breast tissue can make it hard to spot breast cancer and may also increase its risk. The doctor recommended a breast MRI every year and ultrasounds as needed “until I decided what I wanted to do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I always knew, once I found out I had a mutation, that at some point I would want a prophylactic double mastectomy,” Hall said. “No one who had breast cancer in my family survived. So I was waiting for the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Doctors told her that before age 30 would be best, since her mom was diagnosed so young. If she decided to have a preventive surgery, that would be the best time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Not-a-tough-decision" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Not a tough decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/P3SBTEGH2JE45KLPIUE6FLYTOU.JPG?auth=152f6c51fe5aead41524eab240175002c4fee32a7d71f51dd1c5d04766969520&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/P3SBTEGH2JE45KLPIUE6FLYTOU.JPG?auth=152f6c51fe5aead41524eab240175002c4fee32a7d71f51dd1c5d04766969520&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Anna Hall poses for a portrait at her family's home in Draper on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. Hall has a BRCA1 gene mutation, which can cause breast cancer, and has a family history of breast cancer with multiple deaths, including her biological mother; because of those factors, she decided to have a double mastectomy in August. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Isaac Hale, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While she worried some, she was also busy living, so timing mattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall was attending law school at the University of Utah, and put off surgery to make sure she was well covered by health insurance. She graduated last year and got a job as an attorney. This year, she felt like it would all work out, so she had the double mastectomy and began the reconstruction process. She’ll have a second surgery at the beginning of next year to get implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had almost a month off from work to recover and said she is doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She’s very open about the surgery because she knows that some women may be hesitant if faced with the same choice. She benefited from others telling her their story and hopes her story will be helpful, too. She said that she’s thrilled to let go of the cancer fear and she knows that’s what her mother would have wanted for her. She also thinks she’s not the only one in her extended family that has made this choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I know that some women struggle with the fact that breast tissue is no longer there,” Hall said. “I haven’t felt that struggle. My family never focused on our bodies or how we looked at all. It was about being healthy. I think that helped me in this situation. All my friends and family are incredibly supportive. Everybody really, even at work. Take the time you need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And she certainly doesn’t miss the constant worry. “A couple of years ago, I found a lump. The biopsy came back that it was benign. When I found the lump, before I got the biopsy, I broke down. I was crying, upset. How do I finish law school? What do I do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall decided then that she would reduce her risk the first chance she got. And she did, after doing research to find the right surgeon and plastic surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Online support was huge, as well. She found a group on Instagram called “The Breasties,” made up of others who were somehow connected to breast cancer and she asked them questions. She found other resources where she could ask questions and talk about her fears, including those of getting the surgery. One question: “Am I going to regret this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The response was immediate and overwhelming: Women years out from a double mastectomy told her they’d never regretted their choice. She found an old classmate who’d faced the same choice and made the same decision. And she did a lot of online research and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“One of the beautiful things about social media,” Hall said, is finding Instagram posts and videos from people she could message and ask questions. It also becomes a way to help others and be helped, not just with information and personal experience, but with tangible stuff. She had to wear surgical drains for a while after surgery and a woman shipped her a hoodie that was made for the purpose of hiding the drains. “It’s a beautiful community,” she said, with people sharing their stories to help others. She said she hopes to help others as she was helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-busy-full-life" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A busy, full life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall is back to work and nearly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For her, that means time with family and friends. “I am very much a quality time person,” she said, noting she loves going to movies, shopping, taking a sisters’ trip to Disneyland. “I do think some of that comes from losing my mom and other family members at such a young age. I savor every moment I have with people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When she’s not with others, she devours books and belongs to two book clubs. She laughs when people ask her favorite genre, because she’ll read almost anything. She credits her broad taste in and deep love of books to her dad’s mom, who was a librarian and gave her books every holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If friends of family say they’re going hiking, she’s always game to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She loves people. And her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNc2hIX0FsM21iRjlteFZrbDNoRmc1Nm85b1hjLVFacXJPMFpoX2hxVXRFbFViWHhEOUlWaTV4aVNzcWRvZXJFTTBFcmlIa1o4R3EzOFp4al83OVY2OFpRUnpqZ0RjbFhzdVMyVmhGM2JLWDF4VV9CT1pkZFdiYUpCSkF0WmpmTTY3RHdIXzlYOTlUUlZUaTdrRFRNSFVkX25yUW1GRg</guid></item><item><title>数十年来，强大的新抗生素一直“隐藏在普通人的视线中” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have just identified a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-antibiotics-could-be-hiding-in-our-gut-microbiomes"&gt;powerful new antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; – in a significant discovery made not by breaking new ground, but by revisiting familiar territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound, pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was discovered by a team from Warwick University in the UK and Monash University in Australia. While it's never been spotted before, it comes from a type of bacteria that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/that-rAIn-smell-turns-out-we-re-smelling-the-circle-of-life"&gt;scientists have studied for decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially, it could help fight bacteria that have become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-warns-study"&gt;increasingly resistant&lt;/a&gt; to modern treatments – and it's actually an intermediate chemical that's created during the process of making another antibiotic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenomycin_A"&gt;methylenomycin A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forgotten-antibiotic-from-decades-past-could-be-a-superbug-killer"&gt;Forgotten Antibiotic From Decades Past Could Be a Superbug Killer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, the bacterium that makes methylenomycin A and pre-methylenomycin C lactone – &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt; – is a model antibiotic-producing species that's been studied extensively since the 1950s," &lt;a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/new_antibiotic_for_drug_resistant_bacteria_found_hiding_in_plain_sight"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Lona Alkhalaf, from the University of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finding a new antibiotic in such a familiar organism was a real surprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, pre-methylenomycin C lactone was shown to be 100 times more effective than methylenomycin A against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria"&gt;Gram-positive bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, the kinds that are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-caught-bacteria-using-a-never-before-seen-trick-to-avoid-antibiotics"&gt;getting smarter&lt;/a&gt; at outwitting our current antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179467" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic.jpg" alt="Antibiotic graphic" class="wp-image-179467 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic-600x301.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179467" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pre-methylenomycin C lactone was found to be much more potent than methylenomycin A.
