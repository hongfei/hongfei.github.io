                Two-to-three thousand soldiers from Napoleon's army were found in a mass grave in the northern suburbs of Vilnius, Lithuania in 2001.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/19/nx-s1-5579509/thieves-steal-priceless-jewels-louvre" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heist at the Louvre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries," says &lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-paleogenomics/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicolás Rascovan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. "He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases," says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01247-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Current Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94828" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Napoleon's retreating soldiers suffered from the bitter cold, hunger, and an onslaught of disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These wars were anything but glamorous," says &lt;a href="https://www.novetus.at/#kontakt" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michaela Binder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. "For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rich and bloody history, reconstructed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/193/1/112/863741" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA analyses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere," says Rascovan. "So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94829" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth," explains Rascovan. "So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen," he says. "It's like doing a puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'A story of hardship'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data," says &lt;a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/oeai/institute/team/person/leslie-quade" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leslie Quade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be," says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. "We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Their bones tell a story of hardship," says Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as we drift into what feels like unconscious rest, our brains might not be entirely asleep. According to the study &lt;em&gt;DREAM: The Dream EEG and Mentation Database&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, parts of the brain can remain alert during even the deepest stages of sleep — and dreaming may not be limited to REM sleep after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This large-scale, international collaboration brings together decades of dream research into one unified, open-access platform. Coordinated by &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in Australia, the DREAM project analyzed 2,643 awakenings from 505 volunteers, drawing data from 20 separate studies across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dreams Beyond REM: Sleep Is Less Silent Than It Seems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, REM sleep was viewed as the exclusive domain of dreaming — marked by vivid imagery, muscle paralysis, and rapid eye movements. But the data in DREAM challenge this assumption. Among the 2,643 awakenings, participants reported having dream experiences in about 85% of REM cases, but also in a surprising 40% to 60% of NREM (non-REM) awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Woman Wearing Eeg Cap" class="wp-image-92343" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1200x750.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-380x238.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-520x325.jpg 520w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap.jpg 1920w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1200x750.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1200x750.jpg" alt="Woman Wearing Eeg Cap" class="wp-image-92343" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1200x750.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-380x238.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-520x325.jpg 520w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-wearing-eeg-cap.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Woman wearing EEG cap. Credit: Canva&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And even during slow-wave sleep — the deepest and most restorative phase — some individuals described emotional thoughts or fragmented sensations. The researchers examined the final 30 seconds of brain activity before each awakening, using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EEG and MEG technologies&lt;/a&gt; to capture electrical and magnetic patterns in the brain. What they found was surprising: in NREM dreams, brain waves began to show faster, smaller oscillations, mimicking the patterns of quiet wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, the brain — or at least &lt;em&gt;part of it&lt;/em&gt; — may temporarily enter an “awake-like” state, despite the body remaining deeply asleep. These episodes may reflect &lt;strong&gt;brief bursts of conscious processing&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that consciousness during sleep is more of a spectrum than a switch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Learns to Read Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strength of the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/five-fingers-dream-of-mao-zedong/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="62726" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DREAM&lt;/a&gt; project lies not only in the scale of its data, but in its methodology. Each awakening in the study was classified into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; (a clear dream),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience without recall&lt;/em&gt; (often called a &lt;strong&gt;white dream&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;or &lt;em&gt;no experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This triage system allowed researchers to train artificial intelligence models to predict whether a person had been dreaming based on brain activity alone. Simpler brain-wave features gave moderate accuracy in detecting dreams during deep NREM sleep, while more complex models improved accuracy during REM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this is one of the first large-scale efforts to develop non-invasive dream detection tools. With further refinement, such technology could be used to monitor consciousness during sleep — or even serve as an early marker for cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, other research referenced in the article suggests that difficulty reaching REM sleep may signal an early warning sign for Alzheimer’s disease, hinting at a broader medical relevance for sleep-stage mapping and dream monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As co-author &lt;em&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/em&gt; noted in a press release, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work presented in the article, coordinated by Monash University (Australia), resulted from the efforts of 53 authors from 37 institutions across 13 countries, and represents a decisive step in the scientific exploration of human consciousness by bringing together and making decades of dream research available in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once again, his brother told him off. Apparently, getting to the bottom of what this trampoline is all about is a one-dog job, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After this extravaganza had gone on for quite some time, the other Golden Retriever brother decided to try reaching under the trampoline, at which point they succeeded in retrieving a small orange ball that had gotten stuck underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And so ended the great Golden Retriever trampoline mystery of October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;These Dogs Share a Single Brain Cell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As this other video shows, there can be no doubt that these adorable Golden Retriever brothers share a single brain cell. Is the lighter one trying to stand on top of his brother just because…? Or is the darker one trying to wear his brother as a hat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We think there is a good joke to be had somewhere in all this. How many smiling Golden Retrievers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? How many licks does it take for a Golden Retriever to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How many times will these affable, yet hapless, dogs lose a ball under the trampoline and then try pushing their way through it, bouncing up and down without success, before they remember that all they have to do is reach under the trampoline to retrieve their ball, just like they did last time?

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03793-6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; estimates that nearly 76% of gastric cancers may be attributable to H. pylori, with around 12 million cases expected among those born between 2008 and 2017. The infection often remains asymptomatic, allowing the bacteria to persist for years, but it can lead to ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. High-risk populations include people in East Asia, Eastern Europe, South America, older adults, and those with certain dietary habits or family history. Early detection, lifestyle modifications, and targeted treatment can prevent infection-related cancer and reduce the global burden of stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;H. pylori bacteria and their role in &lt;keyword id="20349122" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="stomach-cancer-risk" source="Orion"&gt;stomach cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has been linked to a significant proportion of stomach cancer cases worldwide. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03793-6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, nearly 76% of gastric cancers may be attributable to this bacterium. Researchers estimate that approximately 16 million people born between 2008 and 2017 could develop stomach cancer in their lifetime, with around 12 million of these cases directly linked to H. pylori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori lives in the stomach lining and can silently persist for years without producing noticeable symptoms. While most people remain unaware of its presence, the bacterium can sometimes lead to peptic ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. Asia is projected to account for the majority of H. pylori-related cases, with nearly 8 million expected, while North and South America may see about 1.5 million cases combined. Understanding the role of H. pylori in stomach cancer is vital because it identifies a largely preventable risk factor. Unlike cancers caused by genetics or lifestyle alone, early detection and treatment of H. pylori infection can dramatically reduce future gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations are more vulnerable to H. pylori-related stomach cancer. People living in high-prevalence regions, particularly East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, face a higher lifetime risk. First-generation immigrants from these regions may also carry the bacteria if they were infected during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include a family history of stomach cancer, older age, smoking, obesity, and diets high in salted, smoked, or processed foods. Adults over 60 are especially susceptible, and some genetic predispositions can further increase vulnerability. High-risk individuals should remain vigilant and consider screening for H. pylori if symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs and &lt;keyword id="29822654" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-H-pylori" source="Orion"&gt;symptoms of H. pylori&lt;/keyword&gt; infection to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori often develops in childhood and remains dormant for years. Although many carriers never experience symptoms, about 30% develop complications such as ulcers or gastritis. Common warning signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burning stomach pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full quickly after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or frequent burping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indigestion and bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the bacteria can go undetected for years, persistent digestive discomfort should never be ignored. Timely medical evaluation can prevent serious complications and lower the risk of gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and lifestyle changes to lower stomach cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although H. pylori is a major risk factor, lifestyle and preventive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing stomach cancer. Key steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity to support overall health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or quitting smoking, which compounds gastric cancer risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeking a timely medical evaluation for persistent digestive symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community awareness is also crucial. Educating families about the bacteria, safe hygiene practices, and risk factors can reduce transmission and promote early detection, particularly in high-prevalence regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening, diagnosis, and treatment options for H. pylori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening for H. pylori infection can be done using breath tests, stool tests, or blood antibody tests, while in some cases, an endoscopy may be recommended to examine the stomach lining more closely. If the bacteria are detected, treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors to eradicate the infection and allow the stomach lining to heal. Although routine screening is not advised for populations in countries with low stomach cancer rates, high-risk individuals, including those with a family history, older adults, or people from regions with high prevalence, should undergo testing. Family members may also require evaluation, as the infection can spread within households. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent ulcers, reduce gastric cancer risk, and address a largely preventable cause of this disease.

A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; titled 'Sodium Intake and Hypertension' found on PubMed Central reads, "A reduction in salt intake can have a favourable effect on the cardiovascular system, inducing a reduction in BP values in hypertensive patients, but also with possible benefits in the vascular function and in the viscoelastic properties of the large arteries."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, avoid adding salt in cooking or reduce it from your diet as much as possible. Also, read food labels to identify hidden sodium (which is generally found in processed foods, sauces, canned meals) and avoid such foods. The goal is to reduce the “extra” salt you add, because even small reductions, like 1 teaspoon per day, can impact your BP, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:46:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，您的“麸质敏感性”可能是一个完全不同的问题- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/your-gluten-sensitivity-may-be-a-completely-different-problem-study-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye, and barley – into a dietary villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in&lt;em&gt; The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published today, challenges that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gluten-intolerance-vs-celiac-disease-experts-reveal-the-key-differences"&gt;Gluten Intolerance vs Celiac Disease: Experts Reveal The Key Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body's immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test negative for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were "gluten sensitive" reacted equally – or more strongly – to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="178903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn't have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic, and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg" alt="onions and garlic" class="wp-image-178919 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A fermentable carbohydrate in onions and garlic caused more problems than gluten.

This could be FODMAPs such as fructans or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-178924 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show expectation can activate regions involving pain. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADnBGtNmtE/"&gt;LarisaBozhikova/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn't mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long-term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there's no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone's overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured reintroduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn't explain someone's symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That's because expectation, stress, and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic "gluten is bad" narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267098/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3r9z26000x27pac8d440am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00023d60cr43gqeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00033d608cjvbmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00043d60ocvkc9u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515?adobe_mc=MCMID=32040115521268807963986547309462626171%25257CMCORGID=242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%25252540AdobeOrg%25257CTS=1761227097" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00053d60vqy2s9er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00063d60x4oyxi69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00073d60vfnq3jsn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00093d602tlzq08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000a3d60avpflu6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000b3d604zjes5f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000c3d60e5utgax3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000d3d60oxin9equ@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000e3d60k07xmk17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426333/" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000f3d60iryuy50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000g3d6017nfk1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000j3d60rbhirb28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000k3d604iio6tm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000l3d60w124hfbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000m3d60vzsl76i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000n3d6010wyn7z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”

        &lt;p&gt;The benefits of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, aren’t just limited to treating obesity. New research shows that semaglutide can protect people’s hearts regardless of how many pounds they lose while taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists examined data from a large-scale clinical trial of people with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to people on placebo, they found, those on semaglutide were less likely to develop heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems—even when people hadn’t lost much weight at all. The results indicate that semaglutide can improve heart health in more than one way, the researchers and outside experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings “highlight that the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide may be independent of adiposity and weight loss,” Laurence Sperling, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good for the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs have heralded a new era of obesity (and diabetes) treatment. But for a time, it was unclear if these drugs would also improve people’s cardiovascular health, and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk (the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy) funded a large, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study designed to answer that open question—the SELECT trial. It involved roughly 17,000 people with obesity and a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed for up to five years. The primary results from the SELECT trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; almost two years ago, showed that high-dose semaglutide (the version approved as Wegovy for treating obesity) reduced people’s risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events by 20% during the study period. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; its approval of Wegovy to also cover the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since obesity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, it’s easy to assume that semaglutide’s heart benefits are mostly tied to helping people lose weight. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173824000197"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; has already suggested it’s more complicated than that. In this new research, some of the researchers who conducted the SELECT trial took a closer look at their data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately found no clear relationship between how much weight someone had lost early into the study (20 weeks in) and their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart-protective benefits of semaglutide were also largely the same across different baseline weight groups. In other words, someone who was overweight (a body mass index between 27 and 30) at the start of the study tended to see a similar reduction in heart disease risk as compared to someone with the highest level of obesity (a BMI over 40).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This gives us important information that maybe we should be looking at the indication for these drugs beyond just whether your BMI is more than 27,” Howard Weintraub, preventive cardiologist and clinical director at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, told Gizmodo. Weintraub was one of the lead researchers of the original SELECT trial but wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study did see an association between someone’s waist circumference throughout the study and heart disease risk. The more a person’s waist shrunk, for instance, the greater reduction in risk they had. Waist circumference is another measure of excess body fat. So semaglutide’s slimming of body fat does seem to help explain why it prevents heart disease—but only partly. The researchers estimated that just a third of semaglutide’s effect on lowering cardiovascular disease could be accounted for by a trimming waistline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond weight loss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say these findings could have far-reaching implications for how semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs should be used. If its heart benefits are largely independent of weight loss, then it wouldn’t be helpful to limit the prescribing of these drugs based solely on BMI. People taking semaglutide who lose enough weight to no longer qualify as obese might still benefit from continuing the drug for its heart-protective effects—just as those who don’t lose much weight may, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that GLP-1 therapy could one day be reframed as a standalone treatment for heart disease, regardless of BMI. Richard Kovacs, the interim chief of cardiovascular medicine at Indiana University’s School of Medicine, who is not involved with the study, notes that these findings could shape future guidelines in how doctors manage cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a potential guideline changer because of its robust effect here. This is a well-run, large trial that we’re all familiar with. It’s an important analysis of it,” Kovacs, who is also the chief medical officer for the American College of Cardiology, told Gizmodo. At the same time, he adds, it would probably still take more data from at least one other large randomized trial for such a change to happen easily.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One important question left to answer is exactly how these drugs can improve our heart health. The researchers argue that some of the drug’s protection likely stems from its anti-inflammatory effects, both on excess body fat and elsewhere. But the drug’s influence on blood sugar control or our blood vessels could also be playing a part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another question is whether these heart-bolstering effects can be seen in people who aren’t overweight or obese—something that Kovacs suspects will be put to the test soon enough. And it’s still important to study whether similar benefits are apparent with other GLP-1 medications, including newer drugs that are combining GLP-1s with other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, this research is continuing to demonstrate that there’s still so much left to learn about these already game-changing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we know everything that the GLP-1 agonists do yet,” Weintraub said. “So doctors will need to look at this beyond the prism of a TikTok video, where kids are looking to lose a couple of pounds to look better. That may certainly happen, but I think the cosmetic issues and the role of weight loss are just a small part of it. And as a cardiologist, I’m more motivated by the sort of findings we’re seeing here in reducing cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Along with an unfriendly clime, these winter months can usher in some unwelcome feelings in the guise of the “winter blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the winter blues, and how can you get your energy back if all you want to do is bundle up and hibernate the season away? We spoke with several experts to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winter blues are fairly common, Amy Sedgwick, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MountainsideTreatment/"&gt;Mountainside, a rehabilitation center&lt;/a&gt;, explains. She explains that the winter blues are usually amplified feelings of stress and/or sadness that many experience around the holiday season, typically starting when daylight saving time ends in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less sunlight, shorter days, and the pressure to remain upbeat during the holiday season can cause people to feel withdrawn and upset, even if they have never been diagnosed with depression,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the winter blues, or feeling down or depressed when the days are shorter and the nights are longer, could be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This is a specific type of depression that is only present during certain parts of the year, and wintertime is the most common season for it to crop up. If you are feeling exceptionally sad and/or hopeless, it may be time to see a doctor or mental health professional. But for your average cases of winter blues, these tips from experts should help get you out of your funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of energy often accompanies a general feeling of being down in the dumps. How can you get a little pep back in your step if you just want to cover yourself in blankets and binge Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who don’t feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these 7 energy habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/people-dont-feel-like-hibernating-slugs-every-winter-have-these-habits-exercise.png" alt="woman who exercises so she doesn't feel like a hibernating slug every winter" title="people who don't feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these energy habits exercise" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick says &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tibetan-exercises-daily-stay-young-forever"&gt;exercise is your best bet&lt;/a&gt; for blasting the blues away and improving your energy stores. “Physical movement releases endorphins and has a mood-boosting effect,” she says. “Going ice-skating, participating in winter sports with friends, or committing to a gym routine can provide a self-esteem boost and encourage people who are feeling sad or isolated during the winter months to become more active and motivated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than the physiological benefits, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9914638/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; exercise can provide a mental break from negative thoughts and worries, acting as a form of active meditation.

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;New cancer therapy ‘a major step forward’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A pioneering procedure that deploys ultrasound to destroy tumours is “a major and exciting step forward in cancer treatment”, doctors said this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histotripsy uses sound waves to create microscopic bubbles from gases present in tumour tissues. The bubbles form and collapse in microseconds, destroying cancer cells without the need for surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. With treatment taking as little as 30 minutes, patients can recover quickly and spend less time in hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roger Jackson, 80, is the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment for his liver cancer. “I feel privileged,” he said. “It’s impressive to think that sound waves can treat cancer, without the need for patients like me to go through intensive surgery, at what already is a stressful time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jackson (pictured) was treated at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England, which is currently the only hospital in the country offering the therapy.     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Histotripsy represents a hugely exciting and new era of cancer innovation and care,” said the hospital’s chief exec Roland Sinker. “With faster recovery times … this not only reduces the strain on our hospital beds, but also frees up surgeons to focus on the more complex cancer cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies are underway to explore histotripsy’s effectiveness on other cancer types. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While common symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and unexplained weight loss, recent research shows that certain leg symptoms may appear first. Patients may experience pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the legs, which can serve as early warning signs of pancreatic cancer. Recognising these subtle indicators is vital for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving survival rates. With pancreatic cancer causing over a million deaths globally each year, awareness of both traditional and early leg symptoms is crucial for prevention and early intervention. This aggressive cancer often spreads quickly to nearby organs and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection and awareness even more essential. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pancreatic cancer From signs to treatment process, expert explains how to manage the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leg pain, swelling, redness: Spotting common symptoms of pancreatic cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Pain in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unexplained pain in the legs can be a subtle yet significant warning sign. This discomfort may arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the context of pancreatic cancer, DVT can occur due to the body's altered clotting mechanisms, which are influenced by the presence of cancerous cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Swelling in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained swelling in one or both legs, especially if it develops suddenly, can indicate the presence of a blood clot or other circulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pancreatic cancer patients, such swelling may be linked to DVT or the compression of blood vessels by tumour growth, leading to impaired blood flow. Persistent swelling accompanied by pain, redness, or warmth should be evaluated promptly, as early detection can prevent serious complications and improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Redness in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness or a reddish hue in the skin of the legs can be a sign of inflammation or infection. In the case of DVT associated with pancreatic cancer, the affected area may appear red due to increased blood flow as the body attempts to combat the clot. This discolouration is often accompanied by warmth, tenderness, and mild swelling, indicating underlying circulatory issues that require immediate medical evaluation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Warmth in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation of warmth in the legs, particularly around the swollen or painful areas, can indicate inflammation. This warmth is often a response to the body's immune system reacting to the clot or tumour. In pancreatic cancer, such symptoms may be among the first to manifest, preceding more typical signs like jaundice or abdominal pain. Persistent warmth accompanied by redness, tenderness, or swelling should not be ignored, as it may signal deep vein thrombosis or tumour-related vascular complications requiring prompt medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-breakthrough-scientists-discover-protein-that-could-stop-tumour-growth-in-the-pancreas/articleshow/124158628.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover protein that could stop tumour growth in the pancreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do these symptoms matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these leg symptoms, especially when they occur without an obvious cause, should not be dismissed.

The other was pelvic tilts, which felt so good in my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises not only stretched my lower back, but also activated the muscles surrounding it, which should help to reduce stiffness in the long term, so I’ll definitely come back to these moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the video took the same approach to a series of exercises, performing them dynamically first—moving in and out of position—and then passively, holding the stretch for a few breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves include supine twists, extended child’s pose and cat-cow, all of which felt great for my stiff back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a satisfying routine for someone like me with an achy lower back and my entire body felt less stiff after doing it. I’d recommend it for anyone who needs a short break from a sedentary routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2b349082-5d31-4c67-9fcd-82e9461157ab"&gt;It’s been a hit in the comments too, and a few people have said it reminds them of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;lower back love video&lt;/a&gt; Mishler published in 2014.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roanoke, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; — As a 10-year-old, Autumn Bushman loved to perform. The fourth-grade cheerleader from Salem, Virginia, was a bundle of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She really turned my living room into a dance floor," her mother, Summer Bushman, told CBS News. "She never sat still...She really did care about others more than she cared about herself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the past couple of years, Summer says Autumn was bullied in school over her braces. The abuse also continued after school on her smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, at the age of 10, Autumn died by suicide at night in her bedroom. Records show she was looking at her phone's screen just before it happened, Summer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer told CBS News her daughter would take her phone to bed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had questioned that a couple of times, and she fought back and said, 'Mom, I need my alarm,'" Summer said. "And every single morning when I'd wake her up, she had her alarm going off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from researchers at Virginia Tech shows nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines are linked to teen suicide attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/study-sheds-light-on-overdose-suicide-attempts-among-youth-and-w.html?utm_campaign=organicVTunirel&amp;amp;utm_medium=Virginia+Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=cmpgn_soc&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawNneY5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxanNqNXVTMXlNeUlsSmpGAR737BMQJHB22mLCWTHsWIJtbwcl6ubTD5zzqasiJYE_BhaVrtbisodKMXhA0g_aem_O5CsolpF6bKgGiuJh9YUhA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study examined&lt;/a&gt; data of children ages 12 to 17 who had been admitted to a hospital after attempting suicide by intentionally overdosing. It found that about two-thirds of those overdosed after 8 p.m., and approximately three out of four were on screens right before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very distracting and disturbs your sleep," Dr. Abhishek Reddy, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who conducted the research, said of screen use before bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddy added that it is "pretty dangerous" for bullied children to take their phones to bed at night "because during the daytime, you can talk to people, you can talk to school counselors, you can talk to your family members, friends. But at nighttime, all that access is cut off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends keeping phones out of bedrooms, practicing good sleep hygiene, and reducing access to all medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I come in here and I think, you know, it's been six months since she's been gone, it's been seven months since she's been gone. And then I think to myself, I have to go the rest of my life without seeing her again," Summer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer wishes she had never given Autumn a smartphone so young, let alone allowed her to use it at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She deserved to live life, and I will never see her go to a homecoming or prom," Summer said. "I'll never see her, you know, get married, or in a wedding dress. And that's really difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by calling or texting 988.

            It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist. Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00063b6n8lk4gh5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00073b6n4kvi97pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23458883/" target="_blank"&gt;grew a tooth &lt;/a&gt;from human and mouse cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00083b6nx32ub98d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, she led a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532305/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00093b6ne7zrtypj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000a3b6n6eksaw8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000b3b6nksdqhjnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000d3b6nyj8yc13m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000e3b6nrxthzi6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000g3b6n7cdnstyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000h3b6nlyrkjpm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000j3b6nhcte4hnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000k3b6n7zilp2pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/04/24/pigs-can-regrow-their-adult-teeth-what-if-humans-could-too" target="_blank"&gt;in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000l3b6nuc19zrso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, &lt;a href="https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/teaming-up-for-living-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;has successfully grown&lt;/a&gt; dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000m3b6n1uyj51tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The insulin nasal spray, which delivers insulin straight to the brain, has also been shown to keep brain cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the US, the trial shows some early signs of progress in maintaining brain health in those at risk of Alzheimer's. It enrolled 47 older adults aged 55 to 85 years, 42 of whom completed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, or were cognitively fine but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu387"&gt;showed signs of molecular changes&lt;/a&gt; linked to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were given either empagliflozin alone, the insulin spray on its own, both medications together, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;or a placebo&lt;/a&gt;, for four weeks. The trial was too small to detect any  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="178152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; differences between the groups (its main aim was testing safety); however, some trends were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we found that empagliflozin, an established diabetes and heart medication, reduced markers of brain injury while restoring blood flow in critical brain regions," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Suzanne Craft from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also confirmed that delivering insulin directly to the brain with a newly validated device enhances cognition, neurovascular health, and immune function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-178155 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-639x675.jpg 639w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-600x634.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the benefits seen with empagliflozin (EMPA-Only) was signs of less tau build-up in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Erichsen et al., &lt;em&gt;A&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a diabetes drug, empagliflozin improves the way the body handles glucose and sodium. This has a lot of further effects, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stress on cells, better energy efficiency, and improved insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the medication was shown to reduce the levels of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that we know can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial"&gt;form harmful clumps&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's brains. It also had benefits in terms of blood flow and cholesterol levels, and several other biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insulin nasal spray was chosen because insulin resistance has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-spray-may-slow-alzheimers-disease-study-in-mice-suggests"&gt;previously been linked&lt;/a&gt; to Alzheimer's, and previous research shows insulin's effects on brain cells can help improve immune responses, white matter structure, and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, participants given the insulin spray saw better scores on cognitive tests measuring memory and thinking. Through brain scans, the researchers observed benefits in white matter connectivity and blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;linked to memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body's metabolism, or the way it turns fuel into energy, is crucial to good health, and these treatments focus more on that, rather than some of the later, end-stage effects of Alzheimer's we see in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that targeting metabolism can change the course of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Craft.

        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Deadly strep zoo outbreak hits Bozeman dog daycare, veterinarians warn pet owners&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Bozeman dog owners said they hadn’t heard of Strep Zoo before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, I spoke with Dr. Jessica Matlock from 360 Pet Medical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strep Zoo causes severe respiratory disease in some dogs,” Dr. Matlock explained. “So, some dogs will mount a toxic shock-type syndrome. That means a very rapid onset of pneumonia, which causes the lungs to bleed, and dogs can die within 48 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matlock said dogs that are older or have underlying conditions such as diabetes, Cushing’s disease, or Addison’s disease, as well as puppies, are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cold and flu season affecting pets as well as people, Dr. Matlock noted that mild respiratory symptoms like a runny nose are common. However, she warned of the signs that could indicate Strep Zoo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If nasal discharge turns from white to yellow or brown, that's an indication that there's blood,” she said. “That’s an emergency that would need to be seen by your veterinarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Strep Zoo is highly contagious, Dr. Matlock said pet owners often ask her if there's a risk of going to public spaces like the dog park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Open air is better,” she said, “but a dog can still sneeze on something like a park bench, and another dog could come up right after and get potentially infected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don't advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-may-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic"&gt;A Type of Fiber May Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the guidelines say help (and don't help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg" alt="kiwi fruit halved" class="wp-image-178895 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers recommend eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation.

However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; a day for at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this just isn't realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet – where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn't help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know it's not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267617/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study has revealed that gluten sensitivity, which affects approximately 10% of the global population, is not actually about gluten but part of the way the gut and brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to set a new benchmark for how gluten sensitivity is defined, diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research review, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673625015338" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, examined current published evidence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) to better understand this highly prevalent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with NCGS experience symptoms after consuming gluten but do not have celiac disease, an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten. Common symptoms include bloating, gut pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, University of Melbourne Associate Professor Jessica Biesiekierski, said the findings overturn long-held assumptions about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten+sensitivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to popular belief, most people with NCGS aren't reacting to gluten," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that symptoms are more often triggered by fermentable carbohydrates, commonly known as FODMAPs, by other wheat components or by people's expectations and prior experiences with food."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest combined analysis, only a few tightly controlled trials found any real gluten reaction. Overall, people's responses were no different from when they were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Across recent studies, people with IBS who believe they're gluten-sensitive react similarly to gluten, wheat, and placebo. This suggests that how people anticipate and interpret gut sensations can strongly influence their symptoms," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Taken together, this redefines NCGS as part of the gut–brain interaction spectrum, closer to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, rather than a distinct gluten disorder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team—from Australia, The Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom—say the findings have major implications for people self-managing gut symptoms, for clinicians prescribing restrictive diets, and for policymakers shaping public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Millions of people around the world avoid gluten believing it harms their gut, often after experiencing real symptoms that range from mild discomfort to severe distress. Improving our scientific and clinical understanding of a condition affecting up to 15% of the global population is incredibly important," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, Director of the Snow Centre for Immune Health and a gastroenterologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the updated scientific knowledge could help clinicians provide more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment for patients who present with NCGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Distinguishing NCGS from related gut conditions is essential for clinicians to offer accurate diagnosis and individualized care, as well as treating underlying drivers," Professor Tye-Din said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review supports a more personalized, evidence-based approach to gut health and avoids unnecessary dietary restriction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Biesiekierski added that effective care for people with NCGS should combine dietary modifications with psychological support, while ensuring nutritional adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We would like to see public health messaging shift away from the narrative that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten&lt;/a&gt; is inherently harmful, as this research shows that this often isn't the case," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings additionally call for better diagnostic tools, more rigorous clinical pathways and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/research+funding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research funding&lt;/a&gt; in this field, as well as improved public education and food labeling."&lt;/p&gt;

Many people turn to tried-and-true medications, like minoxidil, the active ingredient in products like Rogaine. Despite a recent connection to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a65130958/are-hair-loss-supplements-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain health risks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain health risks&lt;/a&gt;, many of these solutions are relatively inexpensive and available over-the-counter—a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are exploring a way to make minoxidil more effective for hair loss—and it involves stevia. You’re probably familiar with stevia as a sweetener, and this hair loss hack actually repurposes it. It specifically uses the sweetener stevioside, which is derived from the stevia plant, to help stimulate hair growth. The research on this is still in its infancy, and this particular study was done on mice, not humans. But the findings are impressive enough that they’re already getting plenty of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital; &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the link between stevia and hair growth? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For the study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;For the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers combined stevioside with microneedle patches, which use tiny microneedles to help deliver an active ingredient—in this case, minoxidil—into the skin. The researchers tested this in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose their hair and discovered that more of the minoxidil made it into the skin and more hair grew back in the mice that used the patches with stevioside compared to those that just received minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the stevioside patches caused the mice to regrow hair across 67.5 percent of the treatment area with hair after 35 days. Mice with different treatment options didn’t see as big of an impact, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might stevia help with hair growth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, but the researchers have a theory: Stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve better in water and, in theory, that can help more minoxidil get under the skin and into the hair follicles to push for more growth. In essence, the stevioside “acts as a natural absorption enhancer,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Minoxidil has limited skin permeability, which restricts its effectiveness in traditional applications,” he continues. But minoxidil in dissolving microneedles that are enhanced with something like stevioside can bypass your skin’s resistance to support more minoxidil penetration and, hopefully, create more of an impact, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s important to point out that more research is needed. “I do microneedling in combination with minoxidil to improve efficacy in my practice,” says &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics. “But we need controlled trials for the efficacy with adding stevioside and also the safety. We don’t know what the potential side effects could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't put stevia directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have stevia and minoxidil at home, it’s tempting to want to DIY. But Dr. Goldenberg says that’s unlikely to help. “Without the microneedling, applying stevia onto your scalp won't help much,” he says. “Minoxidil would still have the same absorption issue as using it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to see a dermatologist if you’re dealing with hair loss, Rodney says. “Minoxidil is very useful for some types of hair loss and it’s something you can use at home while you wait to get into the dermatologist’s office,” she says. “But there are many different types of hair loss with different causes and treatments. Depending on the cause of your hair loss, minoxidil may not be the specific or only answer.” Some stand-by treatments dermatologists consistently recommend are here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2% Minoxidil Topical Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This solution contains 2% minoxidil, the only FDA-approved topical ingredient to deal with hair loss.

Researchers found that individuals with higher pain resilience — the ability to maintain positive functioning despite pain — were significantly more active than those with lower resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors like pain intensity or fear of movement made little difference once resilience was considered. The findings suggest that interventions focusing on building psychological resilience could transform chronic pain management and improve overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Resilience Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; High resilience predicted greater physical activity regardless of pain intensity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Over Pain:&lt;/strong&gt; Fear of movement and pain sensitivity had little effect once resilience was accounted for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthening resilience could help patients remain active and enhance well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Portsmouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain affects activity levels, but how individuals understand and act in the face of pain can make a difference, a new study from the University of Portsmouth has found.   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; identified that pain resilience – how well individuals cope with pain – affects physical activity independently of pain, and boosting resilience could enhance both pain management and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113537"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person walking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/pain-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also concluded that treatments focusing on building resilience could help chronic pain patients become more active and improve their overall health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr Nils Niederstrasser from the School of Psychology, Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Portsmouth, the study analysed data from 172 participants suffering from chronic pain, using statistical models to understand how pain resilience affects the relationship between pain and physical activity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined factors such as fear of movement, frailty, the number of painful areas, pain duration, and intensity, both individually and together – to identify which most influenced activity levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that high pain resilience was the key component associated with higher physical activity levels, while other aspects such as kinesiophobia – fear of movement – did not make a significant contribution.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests it’s not the pain itself, but how well people cope with it that largely determines activity levels. This underscores the central role of pain resilience, which continued to be a key predictor of activity even after accounting for pain intensity, emphasising the need to build resilience rather than focus solely on reducing pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Niederstrasser, from the University’s Faculty of Science and Health, said: “What we found is that it’s not how much pain you’re in that determines whether you stay physically active – it’s how you think about and respond to that pain, indicating that how individuals respond to and think about pain matters more than their actual pain sensitivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We suspected resilience plays a major role, and this study helped confirm that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also concluded that treatments focusing on building resilience could help chronic pain patients become more active and improve their overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Niederstrasser added: “People with greater resilience can maintain a positive attitude and push through discomfort, and this psychological factor is a better predictor of physical activity than pain intensity itself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant shift from historically focusing on negative factors like fear of movement, to understanding the power of positive psychological resilience in managing chronic pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research builds on a previous study by Dr Niederstrasser which showed that high levels of physical activity can lower the risk of developing chronic pain. The research detailed how pain prevention programs should include exercise, weight management, and support for social inequalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving forward, further research could examine whether enhancing resilience in individuals with chronic pain leads to increased activity levels, potentially through targeted interventions”, added Dr Niederstrasser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761246963310"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is pain resilience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Pain resilience is the psychological ability to maintain activity and positivity despite chronic pain, helping people function better even when discomfort persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761246981880"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did the study find about physical activity and pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Activity levels weren’t determined by how much pain participants felt, but by how well they coped with that pain — highlighting mindset over sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761247003354"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How can this research change pain treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Treatments may shift focus from only reducing pain to building resilience through psychological training, motivation, and support to help patients stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#412d203433242f6f2920333328322e2f01312e33356f20226f342a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lauren Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://port.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lauren Harrison – University of Portsmouth&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indirect associations of pain resilience and kinesiophobia with the relationship between physical activity and chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Nils Niederstrasser et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirect associations of pain resilience and kinesiophobia with the relationship between physical activity and chronic pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain is associated with a decrease in physical activity for most individuals. Nevertheless, some individuals manage to maintain physical activity levels despite pain. While the exact psychological mechanisms behind this are unknown, it may possibly be due to low kinesiophobia and high pain resilience levels. This study aimed to examine the direct and indirect associations of pain resilience and kinesiophobia with the relationship between pain and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study data were collected from 172 participants suffering from chronic pain. Three path models were fitted to assess the indirect associations between pain resilience and kinesiophobia in the relationship between physical activity and musculoskeletal pain individually and simultaneously. Additionally, a linear regression model was fitted to examine the impact of psychological predictors of physical activity while accounting for musculoskeletal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant proportions of the association between musculoskeletal pain on physical activity occurred through both pain resilience and kinesiophobia. Nevertheless, when examined simultaneously, only the indirect associations via pain resilience remained significant. Similarly, when predicting physical activity levels, only high levels of pain resilience and male gender were associated with increased physical activity levels, whereas kinesiophobia was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights the central role pain resilience plays in retaining physical activity levels when faced with chronic pain. It also implies that pain resilience predicts physical activity levels beyond pain intensity, kinesiophobia, pain duration, and pain spread. It is, therefore, imperative to examine avenues of increasing pain resilience among individuals suffering from chronic pain, not only to improve their pain, but also their overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This possibly bears implications for clinical practice and may inform treatment approaches, whereby pain resilience may be boosted to increase physical activity levels. Nevertheless, given the cross-sectional design, longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to confirm the causal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 19:24:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9zM1VCd0dILWNjSU1LN2tMWC12SldlcXhNNEpyaFUxNTBrczFMekZ2bTdtWmVVQXVvLV9IdTlPSGcxQk56cE9TVS1JSmlLWkxVNHU0VURWSUs1QnBoZ0xHWXRQTFNtMkJHdy1TUw</guid></item><item><title>新地图追踪整个华盛顿州（ KUOW ）的麻疹暴露情况</title><link>https://www.kuow.org/stories/new-map-tracks-measles-exposures-across-washington</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story-content-wrapper"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Afraid you may have been exposed to measles? Washington’s Department of Health is launching an online tracker showing locations where people with the disease visited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Washington has seen 11 confirmed measles cases this year, almost all of which were tied to international travel, according to the health department. Five were children under 5 years old. One more was an older child, and the other five were adults. The most recent infection was confirmed in late August, in a Spokane County infant linked to a case in Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington this year hasn’t had a measles outbreak, defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Oct. 13, an unvaccinated visitor from Arizona who had measles traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the only location listed on the &lt;a href="https://wadoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/10e3b2b43f784eabbdb0a5873acd660d" target="_blank"&gt;new state map&lt;/a&gt; launched this week. Travelers who were at the airport between 11:30 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. that day should watch for symptoms until Nov. 3. The incubation period for measles is 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

    


&lt;/figure&gt;




  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes and a rash beginning on the face before spreading down the body. The highly contagious disease spreads through the air. Most people recover within 10 days without long-term medical issues. But it can be serious or deadly, especially for young children.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the country have been seen measles cases surge this year, with the nation reaching a more than three-decade high of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1,600 nationwide,&lt;/a&gt; as of last week. In 2024, there were just 285 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than half of the infections this year have been in Texas, but a new outbreak in Utah and Arizona has grown to more than 100 cases. South Carolina also has seen cases rise. The outbreaks have been tied to declining childhood immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, one in eight cases this year has resulted in hospitalization. There’ve also been three deaths, the first in years in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide in Washington, about 91% of kindergarten-age children were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the 2024-25 school year, according to state data. That was down from over 94% in the 2019-20 school year. The counties with the lowest immunization rates were Pacific, Pend Oreille, Stevens, Clallam and Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Washington had 86 confirmed measles cases, largely in Clark County, where &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates lagged&lt;/a&gt; behind the state average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Information and vaccination are our strongest tools for preventing measles and keeping our communities safe,” said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, the state’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the country, vaccination rates have dropped since the pandemic. Since taking over as health secretary in the Trump administration, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has deemphasized vaccines as a tool to stave off measles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Washington’s outbreak in 2019, Kennedy came to Olympia to advocate against legislation that would have made it harder for parents to opt their children out of the measles, mumps and rubella shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health hopes the new map will help local health departments by gathering exposure details all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

"This helps thin mucus, making it easier to clear through coughing or blowing your nose, reducing congestion and lowering the risk of secondary infections like bronchitis, sinusitis and pneumonia. Increased fluid intake also helps with transporting nutrients and immune cells throughout the body, which is particularly important when we are fighting infection."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are vomiting or experiencing diarrhea, both experts say that this increases the risk for dehydration and rapid electrolyte loss. “Electrolyte imbalance can cause weakness, confusion and even hospitalization, if it’s severe,” Dr. Petersen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts stress that hydration during sickness is even more important for older adults. “For older adults, hydration is not just about comfort, but also about preventing complications, supporting immune function and enabling a safe recovery from illness. Even mild dehydration can lead to significantly worse outcomes in older adults,” Dr. Shah warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-to-immune-system-when-you-cut-down-sugar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's Exactly What Happens to Your Immune System When You Cut Back on Sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here's Exactly What Happens to Your Immune System When You Cut Back on Sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Petersen, older adults are at a higher risk for dehydration due to a diminished thirst sensation that naturally happens with age. “Older adults may not feel thirsty even when their bodies need fluids,” she explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of that, she says that aging reduces muscle mass, and since muscles store water, this means that older adults have less water stored in their bodies than when they were younger. She explains that some medications are diuretics, which increase fluid loss, another reason why older adults are more at risk for dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Much Fluid To Drink and Tips for Staying Hydrated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re over 60, Dr. Petersen says that it’s recommended to drink between six and eight cups of water (or other liquids) per day when you’re not sick. When you’re battling a sickness, she recommends drinking an additional one to two cups to best support the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a general guideline, that exact hydration needs vary, based on one’s individual health. “A good general guideline, unless your doctor has ordered a fluid restriction, is to drink roughly half your weight in ounces. So, if you weigh 120 pounds, you would try for about 60 ounces (120 divided by 2) in water per day under normal circumstances, and add another 16 to 30 ounces during an illness, if possible,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-doctors-avoid-getting-sick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's Everything Doctors Do To Avoid Getting Sick During Cold and Flu Season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here's Everything Doctors Do To Avoid Getting Sick During Cold and Flu Season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you’re sick, you may not feel like eating or drinking anything. But Dr. Shah says you should still do so, meeting your hydration goal with gradual liquid intake throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best types of fluid are water and clear, warm liquids such as herbal teas, broths and soups. These can help soothe sore throats and coughs. Oral rehydration solutions, such as Gatorade, can also be used, but are typically more helpful when people are having significant losses such as high fevers, diarrhea or vomiting. You should also avoid caffeinated beverages or alcoholic beverages during these times as they can increase fluid loss,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, hydration is a key part of recovery. Remember, the body needs adequate hydration even on days when you’re feeling your best. When you’re sick, it’s even more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-symptoms-2025-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-people-over-60-should-never-ever-do-when-theyre-sick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt; journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area.

In one of the largest studies to date, MRI data from 40,000 adults revealed that impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow predicts dementia risk years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure can damage this system, worsening toxin buildup in the brain. Improving sleep quality and managing blood pressure could help keep this system functioning and lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Clearance Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Impaired glymphatic system function predicted dementia risk in 40,000 adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure and other vascular risk factors disrupted brain waste flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep and blood pressure control may protect glymphatic function and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could underlie many cases of dementia and help explain why poor sleep patterns and cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at the University of Cambridge found that impaired movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – the clear liquid that cushions and cleans the brain – predicted risk of dementia later in life among 40,000 adults recruited to the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113529"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings are published today in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the healthy brain, the so-called glymphatic system serves to clear out toxins and waste materials, keeping the brain healthy. Only discovered as recently as 2012, this system functions by flushing CSF through the brain along tiny channels around blood vessels known as perivascular spaces. It collects waste then drains out of the brain, helping keep it clean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system is thought to be important in protecting against many of the common forms of dementia, which are often characterised by the build-up of toxic substances in the brain – for example, Alzheimer’s disease sees amyloid ‘plaques’ and tau ‘tangles accumulate in brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of dementia is vascular dementia, caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. The most common cause of this type of dementia is cerebral small vessel disease, which affects the small blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the impact of cerebral small vessel disease is even greater because it also interacts with other dementias making them worse; for example, a study of nuns in the US found that among those nuns whose brains showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease post mortem, only around a half exhibited symptoms of dementia – but this increased to around nine in 10 if they also had cerebral small vessel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hugh Markus and colleagues at the University of Cambridge wanted to see whether cerebral small vessel disease and other cardiovascular risk factors damage the glymphatic system – and whether this in turn increases the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it has only been possible to study glymphatic function in mice, but recent advances in MRI scanning have made it possible to study it indirectly in humans. Even so, it was only possible to do this practically in relatively small numbers, but Yutong Chen, while a medical student at the University of Cambridge, developed machine learning algorithms capable of assessing glymphatic functions from MRI scans at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team applied the algorithm to MRI scans taken from around 40,000 adults in UK Biobank. They found three biomarkers – biological signatures – associated with impaired glymphatic function assessed at baseline, predicted the risk of dementia occurring over the subsequent decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these was DTI-ALPS, a measure of the diffusion of water molecules along the perivascular spaces. Another was the size of the choroid plexus, where the CSF is produced. The third measure reflected the flow velocity of CSF into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yutong Chen, from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Cambridge, said: “Although we have to be cautious about indirect markers, our work provides good evidence in a very large cohort that disruption of the glymphatic system plays a role in dementia. This is exciting because it allows to ask: how can we improve this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that several cardiovascular risk factors impaired glymphatic function – and hence increased dementia risk, and that this was partly via causing cerebral small vessel disease, which is visible in the MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Hui Hong, now a radiologist at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, said: “We already have evidence that small vessel disease in the brain accelerates diseases like Alzheimer’s, and now we have a likely explanation why. Disruption to the glymphatic system is likely to impair our ability to clear the brain of the amyloid and tau that causes Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests possible approaches for reducing dementia risk. One is to look at strategies for improving glymphatic function. Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Alternatively, there may be existing medicines that could be repurposed, or new ones that could be developed, to improve glymphatic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible approach is to treat vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure. This is supported by recent studies: the SPRINT MIND trial, for example, showed that intensive blood pressure control (maintaining a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg) led to a 20% reduction in cognitive decline or dementia compared to participants in the standard treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Markus, who leads the Stroke Research Group at the University of Cambridge and is a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, said: “We already know the importance of cardiovascular risk factors when it comes to dementia, and our findings further emphasise this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At least a quarter of all dementia risk is accounted for by common risk factors like blood pressure and smoking. If these impair glymphatic function, then we can intervene. Treating high blood pressure or encouraging people to stop smoking would be an achievable way to helping the glymphatic system work better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, said:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“This study offers us a fascinating glimpse into how problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could be quietly increasing the chances of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By improving our understanding of the glymphatic system, this study opens exciting new avenues for research to treat and prevent dementia. It also emphasises the importance of managing known cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, for reducing dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation, with additional support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239834973"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is the glymphatic system and why is it important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The glymphatic system is the brain’s cleaning network that flushes out toxins and waste through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Disruption of this system can lead to toxin buildup, potentially contributing to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239844481"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How do cardiovascular factors affect dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: High blood pressure and small vessel disease impair glymphatic flow, reducing the brain’s ability to remove waste such as amyloid and tau proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239860807"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can improving sleep or lowering blood pressure reduce dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes.

We examined associations between magnetic resonance imaging–based proxies of CSF dynamics and incident dementia, and whether CSF dysfunction mediates links between cardiovascular risk and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70699-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the UK Biobank, we measured CSF dynamics: perivascular space (PVS) volume, diffusion tensor image analysis along the PVS (DTI-ALPS), blood oxygen level–dependent CSF (BOLD-CSF) coupling, and choroid plexus (CP) volume.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory loss may not simply be a symptom of getting older. New research from Virginia Tech shows that it's tied to specific molecular changes in the brain and that adjusting those processes can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used gene-editing tools to target those age-related changes to improve memory performance in older subjects. The work was conducted on rats, a standard model for studying how memory changes with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it's a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease," said Jarome, who also holds an appointment in the School of Neuroscience. "This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what's driving it at the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+level/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting memory loss in two key brain regions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(25)00714-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the team examined a process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts as a molecular tagging system that tells proteins inside the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; how to behave. When the system functions normally, it helps brain cells communicate and form memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarome and his team found that aging disrupts K63 polyubiquitination in two distinct areas of the brain. In the hippocampus, which helps form and retrieve memories, levels of K63 polyubiquitination increase with age. Using the CRISPR-dCas13 RNA editing system to reduce these levels, the researchers were able to improve memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the amygdala, which is important for emotional memory, the researchers noted that K63 polyubiquitination declines with age. By reducing it even further, they were able to boost memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain's aging process," Jarome said. "In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Reactivating a gene that supports memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025003211?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;Brain Research Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; and led by Jarome with doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene that supports memory formation. As the brain ages, IGF2 activity drops as the gene becomes chemically silenced in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that's imprinted, which means it's expressed from only one parental copy," Jarome said. "When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this silencing happens through DNA methylation, a natural process in which chemical tags accumulate on the gene and switch it off. Using a precise gene-editing tool, CRISPR-dCas9, they removed those tags and reactivated the gene. The result was better memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We essentially turned the gene back on," Jarome said. "When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn't yet have memory problems weren't affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the two studies show that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; is not caused by a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+molecule/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single molecule&lt;/a&gt; or pathway and that multiple molecular systems likely contribute to how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once," he said. "If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer's disease, we have to look at the broader picture."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Collaborative, graduate-led research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both studies were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome's lab and supported through collaborations with scientists at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae, who completed her doctoral work with Jarome in the School of Animal Sciences, led the study on K63 polyubiquitination. Shannon Kincaid, a doctoral student in the same program, led the study on IGF2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/collaborative+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collaborative research&lt;/a&gt; that defines our work," Jarome said. "Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has some memory decline as they get older," he said. "But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer's disease rises. What we're learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected—and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments."&lt;/p&gt;
