Up until now, physicians have mostly used costly, more invasive tests that involve puncturing the lumbar — known as a spinal tap — and brain scans that expose patients to radiation to confirm the presence of amyloid. The Lumipulse test takes a simple blood draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCBRK6J6V5HTVAUTDDV3PSJFKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,” Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQHHXQXYNZENLBCA3ZTAQYK2JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Competition is ramping&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;up among companies developing next-generation tests to diagnose Alzheimer’s, which afflicts nearly 7 million Americans.

In a new NIH-funded study, researchers identified key protein changes in spinal fluid that may serve as the first specific biomarkers for FTD in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins point to problems in RNA regulation and neural connectivity, both crucial for healthy brain function. By analyzing inherited cases of FTD, researchers hope to develop earlier diagnostic tools that can direct patients into appropriate treatments and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Clues Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 4,000 proteins analyzed revealed changes specific to FTD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered RNA regulation and brain connectivity may drive the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Hope:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could lead to the first biomarkers for diagnosing FTD before symptoms worsen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia usually affects older people, so when it occurs in middle age, it can be hard to recognize. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common form is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is often mistaken for depression, schizophrenia, or Parkinson’s disease before the correct diagnosis is reached. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as part of an NIH-funded study, researchers at UC San Francisco have found some clues about how FTD develops that could lead to new diagnostics and get more patients into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110031"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appear in &lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt; on May 16.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured more than 4,000 proteins found in spinal tap fluid from 116 FTD patients and compared them to those from 39 of their healthy relatives. All 116 patients had inherited forms of FTD, enabling researchers to study the disease in living people with confirmed diagnosis, something that isn’t possible in non-inherited FTD cases, which can only be confirmed after death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composition of the proteins that changed in FTD suggest that these patients have problems with RNA regulation — required for the proper expression of genes in the brain — along with defects that affect connections in their brains. These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FTD affects people in the prime of their lives, stripping them of their independence,” said Rowan Saloner, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there’s no definitive way to diagnose it in living patients, unlike other dementias like Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re able to identify FTD early on, perhaps using some of the proteins we’ve identified, we can direct patients to the right resources, get them into the right therapeutic trials, and, ultimately, we hope, provide them with precision treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients came from the ALLFTD Consortium, which is helmed by study co-authors Adam Boxer, MD, PhD, and Howie Rosen, MD, of UCSF, and Brad Boeve, MD, of the Mayo Clinic. Kaitlin Casaletto, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, is the senior author of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Adam Staffaroni, PhD, Emily Paolillo, PhD, Amy Wise, Hilary Heuer, PhD, Argentina Lario Lago, PhD, Julia Webb, Joel Kramer, PsyD, Bruce Miller, MD, Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD, William Seeley, MD, Salvatore Spina, MD, PhD, Lea Grinberg, MD, PhD, Lawren VandeVrede, MD, PhD, Peter Ljubenkov, MD, Suzan Lee, MD, and Julio Rojas, MD, PhD.

Ants that sipped a caffeinated sugar drop found it again more quickly on later trips, leaving a stronger scent trail for nest-mates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery points to a low-cost tweak that might finally turn the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-perform-life-saving-amputation-surgeries-on-injured-nest-mates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invader’s own teamwork&lt;/a&gt; against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-ant-huge-impact"&gt;Tiny ant, huge impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argentine ant (&lt;em&gt;Linepithema humile&lt;/em&gt;) is only about one-tenth of an inch long, yet its cooperative spirit builds super-colonies stretching thousands of miles along the Mediterranean coast and the U.S. West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those armies displace local insects, rob hummingbird feeders, and even short-circuit electrical gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent economic analyses peg the global cost of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-shifting-to-new-habitats-to-cope-with-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive ants&lt;/a&gt; – including crop losses and control bills – at billions of dollars each year. No wonder pest crews keep searching for smarter tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-giving-caffeine-to-ants"&gt;Giving caffeine to ants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, researchers set up a miniature arena: a Lego drawbridge led each ant onto a letter-size acrylic platform where a single sugar drop waited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drops carried no additive, while others contained 25 parts per million (ppm), 250 ppm, or 2 000 ppm of caffeine. One hundred forty-two ants took part, and each explorer tackled the course four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea with this project was to find some cognitive way of getting the ants to consume more of the poisonous baits we put in the field,” says the study’s first author Henrique Galante, a computational biologist at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Regensburg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated cameras tracked every step, logging travel time and the straightness of each path. Without caffeine, the insects wandered, needing the same span to reach the treat on every attempt. Add a modest stimulant, and the story changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-gives-ant-focus-not-speed"&gt;Caffeine gives ant focus, not speed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that intermediate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-evolution-in-plants-the-surprising-story-of-yerba-mate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;doses of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; actually boost learning – when you give them a bit of caffeine, it pushes them into having straighter paths and being able to reach the reward faster,” Galante explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, ants that tasted 25 ppm caffeine shaved 28 percent off their foraging time on every return. Those on 250 ppm cut the clock by 38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture an individual that spent 300 seconds during its first outing – it would need just 113 seconds after three more trips on the lower dose and 54 seconds on the medium dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-consumption-may-lower-the-risk-of-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The stimulant&lt;/a&gt; did not act like an energy drink. There was no uptick in raw speed. “What we see is that they’re not moving faster, they’re just being more focused on where they’re going,” Galante noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that they know where they want to go, therefore, they have learned the locations of the reward.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only path geometry tightened; pace stayed the same. At the heaviest 2 000 ppm dose – the level that kills half of honeybees in tests – the learning advantage disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharper-trails-deadlier-bait"&gt;Sharper trails, deadlier bait&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentine ants rely on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-now-using-cars-to-travel-spread-to-new-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pheromone highways&lt;/a&gt;. A worker that discovers food drags its stinger along the ground, laying a chemical breadcrumb trail that guides the next shift. Faster relearning multiplies that effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to make them better at finding these baits, because the faster they go and come back to them, the more pheromone trails they lay, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/evolutionary-deja-vu-the-symbiotic-relationships-of-trees-and-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more ants will come&lt;/a&gt;, and, therefore, the faster they will spread the poison in the colony before they realize it’s poison,” Galante continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding caffeine could also slash the waste that now limits bait stations. In neighborhoods and orchards, technicians often replenish gels every few days because the first wave of foragers gives up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A caffeinated lure might stay attractive long enough for queens and larvae to receive a lethal serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is already field-testing the recipe at infested sites in Spain. They also plan to check whether caffeine interacts with common active ingredients such as hydramethylnon or spinosad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lowest dose we used is what you find in natural plants, the intermediate dose is similar to what you would find in some energy drinks, and the highest amount is set to be the LD50 of bees – where half the bees fed this dose die – so it’s likely to be quite toxic for them,” Galante notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting a concentration that boosts memory without harming pollinators will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine’s appeal extends beyond Argentine ants. Other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dirt-ants-were-once-masters-of-disguise-in-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; – including fire ants and big-headed ants – share the same food-sharing habits that make baiting tricky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stimulant nudges their neural circuits in a similar way, managers could deploy a single additive across multiple pest fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-learned-about-ants-and-caffeine"&gt;What we learned about ants and caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, caffeine improves ants’ overall focus and learning without increasing speed, allowing them to navigate straighter paths and lay stronger pheromone trails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect boosts the effectiveness of bait traps, leading more ants to the poison and increasing the chances of it spreading through the colony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the benefit peaks at moderate doses – very high levels eliminate the learning advantage and can be toxic. So, overall, caffeine makes ants better at foraging and sharing, which ironically makes them more vulnerable to well-designed pest control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is simple: a dash of coffee in the buffet may turn an army’s fabled navigation skills against itself. When the ants get better at remembering dessert, the colony’s days could finally be numbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)01157-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNd1NXZ3JSc1o3Zm14WkRFbVpuWDVGRERoejYzT3JDajZMSkVRd1hiQzhUUUxjTi15ejZWTjRJVGE4aEs0WGpvSUg1Zk5tZXBBeTlDSmRBc3MzbmIwWUNDVnJwaUpiWlprVDNkbjJ1OXVLQ0NJZXJHdVpwaGxmRUdoSFAtNExrU25NTXc2XzR6R2VxVnM</guid></item><item><title>迈克尔· J ·福克斯（ Michael J Fox ）奇迹般的帕金森转变......但它标志着一个令人不安的新健康里程碑-每日邮报 | Inside Michael J Fox's miraculous Parkinson's turnaround... but it marks a troubling new health milestone - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNV20zRTRmWWFLbHMyZWpUVHpTd09mU3p5UWl1a2VxTm1LblZzZVdDMWpHdTZ3NDEwQ3NHaEl5RUc4cG84RV9kMW8zSHQwYW5KdGVnQ29MU1NtdjN3Tl9IT2MxZVdFa3U4aWdaMlAyajlCTVp1cm56ZUsyVkM0dllNRFd0WDdRS215a3BNbktqbUdFSGZzR3EtaFR3SWvSAaIBQVVfeXFMUGdXRkNMQ2J3THRtc0JGN1RZVGRzbG9KelVQQy0tdEh3U3BNV3p1WjkyMm1zcW9WQ1NCTVFSM1NERGhYbERKQjZ5aGZFWVltanhfMThUSHZKUjQ2NTB5N0lFaFNuRXV4TjRXaUx6OWhMWUMteHFFNGJPRFdUVFVBZlFYbDhLM1V5cjRrX1hDa1JyS3BTOG5YcmNSQmpBOS16QVN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/michael-j-fox/index.html" id="mol-4f4d6e90-3281-11f0-9e47-0773325f82ce" class=""&gt;Michael J Fox&lt;/a&gt; will make an extraordinary return to acting after three decades with Parkinson's disease, which is surging in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fox, 63, was diagnosed at just 29 years old with Parkinson's disease, a progressive brain disorder caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to movement and speech issues that worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the 'Back to the Future' star managed to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-13098315/Michael-J-Foxs-30-year-battle-Parkinsons-Future-kept-diagnosis-secret-seven-years-turning-story-celebrated-documentary-standing-ovation-stars-BAFTAs.html"&gt;hide his disease from the public eye for seven years&lt;/a&gt;, he began appearing on screen less often as he had more trouble walking, talking and controlling tremors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Fox announced this week he is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14719947/michael-j-fox-announces-shrinking-cast-parkinsons-battle.html"&gt;returning to acting&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in five years, starring alongside &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/harrison_ford/index.html" id="mol-90141d60-3282-11f0-9e47-0773325f82ce"&gt;Harrison Ford&lt;/a&gt; and Jason Segal in 'Shrinking' in an undisclosed role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear what his current treatment plan looks like, Fox's recovery could be from a slew of new treatments approved by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-a33e0cf0-3284-11f0-9e47-0773325f82ce" class=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, many of which his foundation has funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But his return to form comes as Parkinson's rises in the US, with over 1million Americans now suffering from the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are unsure what exactly is behind the troubling milestone, but recent research suggests environmental toxins and diet&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14687307/popular-food-parkinsons-disease-link-doctor-urgent-warning.html"&gt; could be to blame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor Michael J Fox (pictured here) was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at just 29 years old. He is now making his return to acting after a five-year absence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the journal Neurology shows the increase in Parkinson's cases and deaths in the US from 1990 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Parkinson's Foundation estimates 1.2million Americans will be diagnosed with Parkinson's by 2030, and 90,000 are struck by the disease every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a 50 percent increase from the previously estimated rate of 60,000 a decade ago, the foundation estimates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe environmental factors could partly be to blame for the rise of Parkinson's disease in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Minnesota, for example, found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856205/Doctors-environmental-cause-Parkinsons-young.html"&gt;exposure to the pollutant particulate matter&lt;/a&gt;, PM2.5, raised the risk of Parkinson's disease by 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14687307/popular-food-parkinsons-disease-link-doctor-urgent-warning.html"&gt;study published earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; also found consuming at least 11 servings of ultraprocessed food in a day increased the risk of early Parkinson's symptoms by damaging dopamine-producing neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are roughly 35,000 deaths per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications and other treatments can help replace lost dopamine and keep symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, Levodopa, crosses the blood-brain barrier to convert itself into dopamine, controlling balance issues and tremors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fox has previously said he takes Levodopa, though it's unclear if he still takes it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, the actor underwent deep brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a surgical procedure that involves making small holes in the brain and implanting electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a device on the chest resembling a pacemakers, electrical zaps get sent through the electrodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Parkinson's disease, it has been shown to interrupt faulty nerve signals in the brain, controlling movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fox is also seen in his 2023 documentary 'Still' working with a physical therapist on walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Johns Hopkins, physical therapy can help Parkinson's patients improve balance and coordination, as well as stiffness and rigidity caused the lack of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of Parkinson's include uncontrollable tremors, slow movements and muscle stiffness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fox is pictured in 1985's 'Back to the Future,' six years before his Parkinson's diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of Fox's last roles was as Louis Canning in the 2012 season of 'The Good Wife,' pictured here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has used speech therapy, as Parkinson's disease damages muscles responsible for speaking and swallowing. This therapy may have helped him maintain the ability to speak and recite lines for acting jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear if Fox has received experimental or newer treatments, his foundation has helped &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5323269/Michael-J-Fox-pledges-100-000-UK-university-develop-Parkinson-s-app.html"&gt;fund several of the newest Parkinson's therapies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include a different form of deep brain stimulation called adaptive deep brain stimulation, which adapts electrical impulses in real-time based on symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means it can sense and adjust when a patient's brain activity changes, offering a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adaptive deep brain stimulation was just approved by the FDA for Parkinson's in February and is expected to be widely available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Michael J Fox Foundation has also funded two medications placed under the tongue and inhaled that are meant to 'rescue' Parkinson's patients during 'off' episodes and quickly alleviate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both drugs are currently being reviewed by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:31:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; has identified taurine, a naturally occurring amino acid, as a critical factor in the growth of certain types of leukemia, &lt;a

title="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;according to researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Rochester’s Wilmot Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The findings could lead to new treatments for myeloid cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;These aggressive blood cancers all originate in the bone marrow, where the research shows cancer cells depend on taurine from their environment to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Led by Jeevisha Bajaj, Ph.D., the Wilmot team discovered that leukemia cells cannot produce taurine on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Instead, they use a transporter to absorb taurine from the surrounding bone marrow microenvironment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;By using genetic tools to block this uptake in both mouse models and human cell samples, scientists were able to stop leukemia growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,” said Bajaj, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and a member of Wilmot’s Cancer Microenvironment research program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The study adds to growing evidence that metabolism—how cancer cells get energy—is just as important as genetic mutations in driving cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers found that once inside leukemia cells, taurine promotes glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesveld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, urged caution regarding taurine supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid, also found in the brain, heart, and muscles, is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Cancer patients sometimes take it to ease chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“Dr. Bajaj’s work shows that local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in use of high-dose taurine supplementation,” Liesveld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers emphasized that more work is needed to understand the role taurine plays in cancer development and resistance to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Bajaj said one of the next steps is to study taurine levels in patients with leukemia and to develop methods for safely blocking taurine from entering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy, our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,” the authors wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL COUNTY — The Will County Health Department is reminding residents to be vigilant of the potential for exposure to rabies from infected animals after a rabid bat was detected in Monee earier this month, according to a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was found on May 8, the department said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bats are the most common source of potential rabies infection in Illinois, and exposures from bats tend to be more frequent during the summer months, especially July and August. Rabies can also be found in other wild animals, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a preventable disease that can be fatal if not treated properly,” said Alpesh Patel, Chief Epidemiologist for the Will County Health Department. “Bats are often the most common carrier of rabies. We want our residents to be informed of the potential dangers of rabid animals and stay away from bats and any wild or unfamiliar animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous system. Rabies can spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies can also be contracted when saliva from a rabid animal comes into contact with a person’s eyes, nose, mouth, or an open wound. If someone wakes up to find a bat in the room, that is also considered an exposure even if they cannot identify a bite. A bat’s teeth are small, and a bite mark may not be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover a bat in your home, do not kill or release the bat. Instead, immediately consult with your local animal control to determine appropriate next steps. If you have been bitten by a bat or any wild animal, seek immediate medical attention. Animal bites may also become infected with bacteria. Rabies preventive treatment, if needed, must begin within a few days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An animal does not have to be aggressive or exhibit other symptoms to have rabies. Changes in any animal’s normal behavior can be early signs of rabies. A bat that is active during the day, found on the ground, or is unable to fly is more likely than others to be rabid. Such bats are often easily approached but should never be handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health offers the following tips can help prevent the spread of rabies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not touch, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick wild animals to health. Call animal control or an animal rescue agency for assistance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. “Love your own, leave other animals alone” is a good principle for children to learn to reduce the risk of exposures to rabid animals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain homes and other buildings so bats cannot get inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a bat is in your home, do not release the bat outdoors until after speaking with animal control or public health officials. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After consulting with animal control or public health officials, the bat may need to be captured for rabies testing to determine if you need preventive treatment or if your pet may have been exposed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steps you can take to capture the bat if animal control is not available:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the bat lands, approach it slowly, while wearing thick gloves, and place a box or coffee can over it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide a piece of cardboard under the container to trap the bat inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tape the cardboard to the container securely, and punch small holes in the cardboard, allowing the bat to breathe and call animal control. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can find more information about rabies and how to prevent exposure at the Illinois Department of Public Health website: &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747505099294000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1lzylfHPyePqvr4huA_wu5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rabies (illinois.gov)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 18:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTmtOOWlwQzFEWGZhN2U1RVppYzBva2l5VU1wYmJFY3RxMmJUVGh0dGU0WERKa3hpazFiUHBEMEhYX0hYX2llWkMxaW5FRy15bjg4cER1TmUyZnBMTmV5dVNocVVnWU5kR2F1ZHJJcnF3d1Vsb25WYV8wOEprZ1VwSTNOek14bEJWSjBfbjRn0gGnAUFVX3lxTE93Qi1jOThvQkktY1E5cUQ4STZkZ0JiRk4wUDFlb1Y5akNDbGVVZTNCc1ZpOElyeUxCLXU0Z3ExelFQZDlfaUYwanVSRGlkY1lBRUVydzRidGpKTlkyZ0g5ZTdzZ015XzZ4OFduYy1QYUpLN28zaXYtbXdEbm53bEtwbmFhaWlMZWdJYlJ5UXFrM243Ynp0LTlCUmo1cFpTSEd6aGNyYk00</guid></item><item><title>美国妇女死于休眠50年的疯牛病样脑部疾病- Gizmodo | U.S. Woman Dies From Mad Cow-Like Brain Disease That Lay Dormant for 50 Years - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPSFU1NU5OcFAza0YwVWZlVXBIblJwS0NZUnBHd2YzOXRuRkdhRzZYQXcxRjZWVC1Vc0lYdTQxRHdzRGdMN0NfNVZnLWQ0TUhST290eXU1TFdiYmdmWDc3dzlQVjN4UUxrQ1NqT1hLVTRCTHlSTlhjQkl2X0Z3OUJIX3Y5M2RQdWl0M2pUNGNFdnREdm81S0tqeEN2Y3hpejN6VG5fdG43dFJwU3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The grim reaper can sometimes take decades to catch up with its victims. In a report out this week, scientists describe a woman who died from an incurable prion disease caught roughly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors detailed the unusual case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 58-year-old woman developed a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) likely contracted through contaminated human growth hormone (HGH) treatments she received as a child, they determined. The tragic death may represent the longest latency period ever documented for this universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disease-causing prions are one of the strangest things that can sicken people. They’re the misfolded form of the normal (but still very mysterious) prion protein found in our bodies and brains. When a rogue prion comes across its harmless counterpart, it converts the latter into a misfolded copy of itself, much like a zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, the exponential accumulation of bad prions destroys the brain, leading to symptoms like dementia and death soon after. If that’s not scary enough, prions are naturally resistant to most standard methods of sterilization used to kill off other infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The one saving grace is that prion diseases in general remain very rare, though other prion-like diseases like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alzheimers-disease-transmissable-human-growth-hormone-1851206087"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prions can emerge sporadically for no clear reason, can be caused by inherited mutations, or they can be transmitted though close contact with infected bodily fluids or brain matter. In the 1980s, for instance, doctors discovered that people could catch CJD through human growth hormone extracted from prion-infected cadavers. A decade later, we learned that people could also catch CJD via tainted beef from cows infected with their own version of prion disease (nicknamed mad cow disease).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery of HGH-related CJD quickly led to the end of cadaver-sourced HGH in the U.S. and other countries (thankfully, synthetic HGH became available soon after). Still, over two hundred cases of iatrogenic CJD—iatrogenic meaning it was caused by a medical treatment—from tainted HGH have been documented worldwide. Most of these cases were reported between five and 10 years after people had used HGH. But prion disease can sometimes take much longer to manifest in certain people, even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to this latest report, the woman first visited doctors with tremors and trouble balancing. As is often the case, once symptoms started, her condition rapidly worsened. She was hospitalized just four weeks later, and several days into her stay, she fell into a coma that she would never awaken from.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An autopsy confirmed the woman’s death from CJD but ruled out known genetic causes. And since she received HGH treatment prior to the cadaver ban, it was likely the root source of her illness, the doctors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HGH is used to treat severe growth-related conditions in children, and is typically taken over many years, including in this case. That makes it impossible to know exactly when the woman contracted CJD. Her first treatment was 51.3 years prior to her symptoms appearing, for instance, while her last treatment was 42.1 years earlier. But the U.S. switched to a different method of collecting HGH from cadavers in 1977, one that inadvertently and greatly reduced the risk of prion contamination. Based on that, the most likely timeframe for her infection is around 48.3 years earlier, the authors calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are known cases of people dying from CJD infections caught over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prion-disease-can-lurk-in-your-brain-for-30-years-befor-1823628617"&gt;30 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(06)68930-7/abstract"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of other prion diseases emerging over a half century later. But this appears to be the longest case of HGH-related CJD documented so far, though it might not be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that genetics can influence a person’s chances of developing prion disease. And the woman possessed a mutation in the gene that codes for the prion protein linked to longer latency periods. So while tainted human growth hormone hasn’t caused CJD for a very long time, some people out there may still one day succumb to their earlier exposure (it’s estimated that around 7,700 people in the U.S. took HGH prior to the cadaver ban).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors say that doctors treating neurological illness should at least be on the lookout for these delayed cases, especially if their patients have a history of HGH treatment before 1977.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although the US iCJD outbreak has slowed substantially, the potential for new cases remains,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the boy's fourth month, researchers were meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory approval for a clinical trial—a trial where KJ would be the only participant. They were also working with the institutional review board (IRB) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to go over the clinical protocol, safety, and ethical aspects of the treatment. The researchers described the unprecedented speed of the oversight steps as being "through alternative procedures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In month five, they started toxicology testing in mice. In the mice, the experimental therapy corrected KJ's mutation, replacing the errant A-T base pair with the correct G-C pair in the animals' cells. The first dose provided a 42 percent whole-liver corrective rate in the animals. At the start of KJ's sixth month, the researchers had results from safety testing in monkeys: Their customized base-editing therapy, delivered as mRNA via a lipid nanoparticle, did not produce any toxic effects in the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical-grade batch of the treatment was readied. In month seven, further testing of the treatment found acceptably low-levels of off-target genetic changes. The researchers submitted the FDA paperwork for approval of an "investigational new drug," or IND, for KJ. The FDA approved it in a week. The researchers then started KJ on an immune-suppressing treatment to make sure his immune system wouldn't react to the gene-editing therapy. Then, when KJ was still just 6 months old, he got a first low dose of his custom gene-editing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Transformational”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the treatment, he was able to start eating more protein, which would have otherwise caused his ammonia levels to skyrocket. But he couldn’t be weaned off of the drug treatment used to keep his ammonia levels down (nitrogen scavenging medication). With no safety concerns seen after the first dose, KJ has since gotten two more doses of the gene therapy and is now on reduced nitrogen scavenging medication. With more protein in his diet, he has moved from the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile in weight to 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile. He's now about 9 and a half months old, and his doctors are preparing to allow him to go home from the hospital for the first time.

Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Elon Musk, and William Shatner have all supported the cause of giving Pluto its planetary status back &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tyson, an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, has been a strong supporter of demoting Pluto from its status as a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pluto is not only different from the other planets, it's part of a whole new family of objects,' he argued in his book The Pluto Files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Shatner has some major support in this controversy, including the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-7653569/NASA-chief-Jim-Bridenstine-says-Pluto-planet-AGAIN.html"&gt;former head of NASA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, Jim Bridenstine refused to accept the change, claiming that Pluto was still the ninth planet because it has an ocean under its surface, organic compounds on its surface, and its own moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can write that the NASA Administrator declared Pluto a planet once again. I'm sticking by that, it's the way I learnt it, and I'm committed to it,' Bridenstine said at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bridenstine led the space agency from 2018 to 2021 after being appointed to the position during President Trump's first term in office. He's criticized the IAU for having a 'sloppy definition' of what they consider a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,” &lt;strong&gt;said FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Knowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder known to slowly destroy memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, is progressive, meaning that the disease gets worse over time. In most people with Alzheimer’s disease, clinical symptoms first appear later in life. Amyloid plaques in a patient’s brain are a hallmark sign of Alzheimer’s disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient’s symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. Similar FDA-authorized/cleared tests, one from the same company as this new test, are used with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which are collected through an invasive lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. This new Lumipulse test only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million,” &lt;strong&gt;said Center for Devices and Radiological Health Director Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt; “Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this clinical study, 91.7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and 97.3 % of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks associated with the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio are mainly the possibility of false positive and false negative test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positive results, in conjunction with other clinical information, could lead to an inappropriate diagnosis of, and unnecessary treatment for, Alzheimer’s disease. This could lead to psychological distress, delay in receiving a correct diagnosis as well as expense and the risk for side effects from unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA reviewed the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio through the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-and-clearances/510k-clearances"&gt;510(k) premarket notification pathway&lt;/a&gt;. A 510(k) notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA found that the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is substantially equivalent to the Lumipulse G β-amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40), which is the previously authorized test that uses CSF samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio was granted &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program"&gt;Breakthrough Device&lt;/a&gt; designation, a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA issued clearance of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio to Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the poorest results were seen in people who showed depressive symptoms, and had nine or more hours sleep a night, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mood disorder is known to trigger patterns of excessive sleep, and the experts pose that depression, rather than sleep itself, may be driving the cognitive decline in these patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, its not just those who suffer from low mood that are at risk from too much rest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who showed no signs of depression, but slept for more than nine hours a night, experienced decreased cognitive function, struggling with global cognition and visual reproduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns contribute to an increased risk of cognitive deficits and Alzheimer's disease', Prof Young explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings echo that of previous studies, including one 10-year-long report, published in the Psychiatry Research journal, that found sleeping for more than eight hours a night, on average, was linked with an alarming 64 per cent increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst experts are not entirely sure why excess shut eye could contribute to dementia, one Swedish &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0065"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0043"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;said it is also possible that brain damage caused by early dementia could be fueling a need for excess sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="72" data-end="601"&gt;A new long-term study is challenging decades of diet discourse around carbohydrates—this time, not with warnings of weight gain or blood sugar spikes, but with data connecting high-quality carb consumption to healthy aging. Published in &lt;em data-start="316" data-end="335"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834202?guestAccessKey=d876a1c9-c298-43d8-8354-2befe857fad9&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=051625" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; tracked more than 47,000 women over three decades, revealing that those who consumed &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/plant-based-foods-most-fiber" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;more dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; and carbohydrates from whole plant foods in midlife had a significantly higher chance of aging healthfully into their 70s, 80s, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Researchers from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from the renowned Nurses’ Health Study, which began in 1976 and remains one of the largest and longest-running studies on women’s health. Using food-frequency questionnaires gathered every four years from 1984 through 2016, the researchers focused on dietary intake in midlife—specifically carbohydrates—and cross-referenced that with health outcomes in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Quality carbs equal longer life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;“We’ve all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy, or blood sugar levels. But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later,” Andres Ardisson Korat, scientist at the HNRCA and lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="credit" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjUwMjEyLzMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMzYweCIseyJmb3JtYXQiOm51bGx9XSxbInAiLCJvcHRpbWl6ZSJdXQ/3.jpg?sha=81eb8a9566a18f58" alt="older woman grocery shopping"&gt;Canva&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1591" data-end="2086"&gt;Healthy aging, as defined by the study, included living without major chronic illness, retaining strong cognitive and physical function, and maintaining good mental health. Of the participants analyzed—who were between the ages of 70 and 93 in 2016—just 3,706 met this definition. But among those who consumed more unrefined carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, as well as more dietary fiber overall, the odds of reaching older age in good health rose substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2088" data-end="2438"&gt;Specifically, the researchers found that high midlife intakes of dietary fiber and high-quality carbohydrates were linked to a six to 37 percent greater likelihood of &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/food-lessons-oldest-people-blue-zones" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in refined carbohydrates and starchy vegetables—such as white potatoes—were associated with 13 percent lower odds of aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;“Our results are consistent with other evidence linking consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes with lower risks of chronic diseases, and now we see the association with physical and cognitive function outcomes,” said Qi Sun, associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;Fiber and healthier aging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2796" data-end="3410"&gt;The implications are particularly meaningful in the context of rising life expectancy and increased interest in how to extend not just lifespan, but healthspan—the number of years lived in good health. According to data from the World Health Organization, global average life expectancy has increased by more than six years since 2000, reaching 73.4 years in 2019. But the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy remains significant. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that while life expectancy is around 77 years, only about 68 of those are spent in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3412" data-end="3553"&gt;Against that backdrop, this new study strengthens the case for fiber-rich, plant-based diets in supporting both longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;The research builds on a growing body of evidence that prioritizes not just what people eat, but when. “Studies are starting to find an association between food choices in midlife and quality of life in later years,” said Ardisson Korat. “The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/recipes/beans-marbella-with-salty-roasted-potatoes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjMyMTg3L1ZlZ05ld3MuQmVhbnNNYXJiZWxsYS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEzNjB4Iix7ImZvcm1hdCI6bnVsbH1dLFsicCIsIm9wdGltaXplIl1d/VegNews.BeansMarbella.jpg?sha=98dcdf2aff3af823" alt="VegNews.BeansMarbella"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3904" data-end="4194"&gt;Past studies have already linked plant-based diets to a reduced risk of chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. But this is one of the first large-scale studies to analyze how carbohydrate intake during midlife relates directly to overall aging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;Still, the authors caution that the findings have limitations. The study population consisted mostly of white female nurses, which may not reflect the experiences of more diverse populations. Additional research is needed to determine whether the associations hold across racial, socioeconomic, and gender lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;And while the findings offer compelling associations, they do not confirm causality. More research is required to explore the specific biological mechanisms at play—particularly how fiber and carbohydrate quality influence inflammation, &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/vegan-gut-health-recipes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, and cellular aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;Diets for an aging population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4790" data-end="5266"&gt;The study was supported by the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service through a cooperative agreement, as well as by the National Institutes of Health. The Nurses’ Health Study, which began tracking 121,700 nurses in 1976, has been instrumental in shaping dietary guidelines and public health policies for nearly five decades. Its comprehensive datasets allow researchers to track long-term trends across a wide array of lifestyle and health variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="5268" data-end="5642"&gt;With interest in healthy aging and longevity booming—particularly among aging Gen Xers and Millennials now entering midlife—these findings add new urgency to rethinking the role of carbohydrates in the diet. While low-carb trends such as keto and paleo continue to dominate consumer markets, studies like this one are helping to clarify that not all carbs are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="5644" data-end="5812"&gt;Instead, the new longevity conversation may start with fiber-rich fruits, ancient grains, beans, and vegetables—not with eliminating carbs, but choosing the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 5-6
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA — A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he's among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments," said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around 1 in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing KJ's odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that's never been done before," Nicole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go," her husband added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within six months, the team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ's faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA "letter" — also known as a base — to the correct type. Known as "base editing," it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "very exciting" that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn't involved in the study. "This really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, "he slept through the entire thing," recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 ½-month old also takes less medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering his poor prognosis earlier, "any time we see even the smallest milestone that he's meeting – like a little wave or rolling over – that's a big moment for us," his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers caution that it's only been a few months. They'll need to watch him for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ," Ahrens-Nicklas said. "But every day, he's showing us signs that he's growing and thriving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musunuru said his team's work — funded in part by the National Institutes of Health — showed that creating a custom treatment doesn't have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was "not far off" from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in, and I would expect the costs to come down," Musunuru said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research "sets the stage" for treating other rare conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. "There are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we're pretty much ready."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

And all the other kids went to sleep.” This was most odd. “I was thinking: ‘Didn’t we just get here?’” Even then, White didn’t sleep much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Today White, from California, is 82. Which means that, in the years since, she has spent perhaps a decade longer conscious than her average contemporary from childhood. Last night, a pretty normal night, she went to bed at 2.30am and got up at 5.30am. And she feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="cb4187e5-7214-4ec8-8685-bb565289dbab"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Experts say people with a similar condition to White not only sleep less but also sleep better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;NATHAN WEYLAND FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“My brain doesn’t get tired, and my body doesn’t get tired. Everybody around me gets tired.&lt;span&gt; I wear everybody out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She also now knows why. A new scientific paper has argued she has a gene mutation that is, for her, a sort of superpower. It makes her a “natural short sleeper”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ying-Hui Fu, from the University of California San Francisco and the author of that paper, has worked with dozens of such people. And they are more than curiosities. She thinks they could hold the key to improving all our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What I learnt from these people is that it is possible for humans to do this. They can live a happy, active, healthy, long life.” Somehow, their quality of sleep is such that they simply don’t need as much. Imagine, she said, if every person in the world were able to sleep less but receive better results from it? Imagine if all those &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weekend-lie-ins-lower-risk-heart-disease-sleep-w80b6g7ls" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;conditions linked to poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; — Alzheimer’s, obesity, cancer — could be staved off? “We just have to figure out how.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-cant-i-sleep-bedroom-changes-p20lswspd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why can’t I sleep? Make these 5 changes to your bedroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For White, the diagnosis explains so much. It explains why she once spent 72 hours playing bridge. “After three days, I wasn’t tired. It’s a very bizarre way to live.” It explains why she is still so active — at her retirement community she teaches English as a second language, sits on committees, fixes tech products and runs a volunteer programme. “I’m always busy. My mind won’t shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It explains why, when she first got married, she found her husband to be so inexplicably indolent that one Sunday morning she threw a glass of water in his face while he slept in. “I only did it once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It also, though, poses a question. Why, if she doesn’t need to sleep so much, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-your-brain-needs-slow-wave-sleep-health-advice-2024-lgrpl58k2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;do the rest of us&lt;/a&gt;? This is what Fu wants to understand. We know sleep is extremely important. “When we are asleep our bodies remove toxins, clear up all the bad stuff, repair all the damages and all this is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While studying White several years ago, Fu recorded her sleeping for a relatively luxuriant six hours. White said this slothfulness could be explained by an undiagnosed thyroid problem. Fu said she had no reason to doubt her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;White’s mutation, while unique, fits with others among short sleepers Fu has studied. Fu and her colleagues have shown that if induced in mice, they too sleep less. Short sleepers not only need less sleep, they also do a lot better on what they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.11"&gt;&lt;div id="250e5ec5-0552-4bfd-bbce-2be2983903b6"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;White used to believe everyone else was strange for sleeping so much&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;NATHAN WEYLAND FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“For you and me, we sleep eight hours and our body completes maybe 95 per cent of all these tasks.” For them, in sometimes half the time, “they probably reach 100 per cent completion. They sleep less and do better. A lot of these people are very smart and very sharp”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Before she retired, White had several jobs. “I owned three real estate companies, doing property management.” Her husband was a clinician. “I ran his medical office. I just did whatever I could get my hands on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is pretty normal. One of Fu’s subjects does triathlons in her eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/what-to-eat-to-help-sleep-insomnia-ntzgn6h9q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to eat to help you sleep — by the insomnia expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For a long time, White didn’t think she was odd. Even as she lay awake as a child, looking at the wallpaper and listening to her parents until they went to sleep, she didn’t realise this was unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She just thought everyone else was lazy. “I always started with the idea other people had the problem. I was like: ‘Why are you coming into work grumpy because you didn’t sleep? Get a hold of yourself.’” Then, after she got married, began to have more control over her schedule and made the glass of water mistake, she had the first inklings she might be the odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Now she is pleased that she at last understands. “You go a whole lifetime of explaining yourself, of never finding everyone like you.

              &lt;p&gt;A pivotal medical milestone has been reached. For the first time ever, researchers have used a personalized CRISPR-based gene therapy to treat an infant’s rare and life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine detailed their achievement in a study &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The treated child, named KJ, was born with a metabolic disorder known to kill up to 50% of children in their infancy. Now, three months after his first dose, KJ appears to have responded well to the treatment and is doing better than ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,” said Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, director of the Gene Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Disorders Frontier Program at CHOP, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after his birth last summer, KJ was diagnosed with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/carbamoyl-phosphate-synthetase-i-deficiency/"&gt;CPS1&lt;/a&gt;) deficiency. The disorder prevents his liver from producing a key enzyme that breaks down ammonia, a common waste product, into urea (which is then flushed out in urine). Because of this, ammonia levels continue to build up, eventually causing organ damage. While rare, CPS1 can be caused by a variety of different mutations, meaning that cases often don’t share the same genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Certain treatments, including a strict low-protein diet, can help keep ammonia levels down in people with CPS1, but around half of those who develop it as infants die within the first week (cases that emerge later in life have a much higher survival rate). Until now, the only curative treatment available for CPS1 was a liver transplant. But babies like KJ typically have to wait until they’re old enough to survive the intensive procedure, during which time they’re vulnerable to the severe complications of CPS1, including permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, though, researchers at CHOP and Penn Medicine had been trying to rapidly develop customized gene therapies for people with rare genetic diseases. And KJ seemed like the perfect test case for their emerging approach. With permission from his parents and eventually the Food and Drug Administration, the team set to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of just six months, the researchers crafted, tested, and treated KJ with his own personalized gene-editing drug. The therapy uses a form of CRISPR—delivered to his liver cells using lipid nanoparticles—to edit a specific base (bases being the building blocks, or letters, of DNA) in the defective gene responsible for KJ’s condition. The goal is to repair the defect and allow his liver to break down ammonia as usual. The therapy was first tested in mice and then monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;KJ was initially given a low dose of the gene therapy, codenamed k-abe, in February 2025. After he appeared to tolerate it well, he received two higher doses in March and April with no apparent serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the months since, he’s been able to ingest increasing amounts of protein and he’s required lower doses of another treatment used to manage the condition. He did experience several common childhood infections during this time period, which can be life-threatening in people with CPS1, but he recovered with no major issues—another promising sign.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It will take time to know whether the therapy is safe over the long term, however, or if KJ might require additional treatments. But for now, everything seems to be working just as hoped. And KJ’s story is ideally only the start. The researchers believe their approach can be tweaked to treat a wide array of ultra-rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If so, KJ’s success might herald a new era of personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” said Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at Penn Medicine and lead author of the NEJM paper, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The promise of gene therapy that we’ve heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it’s going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

Known as HEALS—Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics—this model proposes that psychedelics disrupt the typical hierarchy between hemispheres, releasing the more holistic, emotionally intelligent right side from left-brain control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging shows a rightward shift in brain activity under psychedelics, aligning with traits often enhanced during these experiences, like mindfulness, empathy, and clarity. Research also finds parallels between the effects of psychedelics and practices like meditation, which also strengthen right-hemisphere networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEALS Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Proposes that psychedelics shift dominance from the left to the right hemisphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Right-brain dominance may enhance empathy, creativity, and insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuroimaging shows increased right-hemisphere activity under psychedelics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret to psychedelic drugs’ links to greater empathy and insight may lie in their ability to coax the right hemisphere of the brain into a position of dominance over the left, according to a proposed new theory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researcher Adam Levin combined his experience in therapeutic psychedelics research and psychiatric training with a review of imaging, numerous studies and previous models to support his proposal, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, Levin emphasizes not what the two brain hemispheres do, but how they approach a topic or task – working in parallel, with left-brain dominance, during typical modes of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re solving a problem, or, evolutionarily speaking, hunting for food, for example, the scope of attention differs: The left hemisphere focuses on manipulation of individual parts while the right hemisphere maintains a big-picture frame of reference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the psychedelic state, there’s a unique combination of the hemispheres coming together in a way that doesn’t usually happen in normal states of consciousness,” said Levin, a postdoctoral scholar and psychiatrist in the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education in The Ohio State University College of Social Work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost a new encounter between the left and the right hemispheres’ way of thinking and perceiving the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He calls this model of psychedelic action HEALS: Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effect, he suggests, psychedelics reverse the hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain, releasing the right hemisphere from inhibition by the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin was initially inspired in part by the writings of Iain McGilchrist, author of “The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his own clinical experience as a medical student and psychiatry resident gave Levin an up-close look at how disorders affecting one side of the brain or the other affected patients’ world view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people who lose the right hemisphere to stroke, the attentional window gets so narrow and they don’t even recognize a whole half of the world. Whereas people with an intact right hemisphere, who lose their left hemisphere, still have a broader general picture of things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these people’s experiences seem, to me, to be similar to what I’m seeing in my psychedelic research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous hypotheses about psychedelics’ effects on the brain have suggested “unrestrained cognition” occurs through the weakening of control exerted by frontal lobes and the top of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is likely true, Levin said, patterns observed in people’s reports of their psychedelic experiences suggest there’s more going on: There are increases in psychological flexibility, creativity, and social and emotional intelligence; greater empathy, harmony and connection; a broader attentional window toward novelty and “aliveness”; and clarity and insight about one’s basic existence and, in some cases, need for healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those general patterns are awfully similar to the pattern of the right hemisphere,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think psychedelics provide access to this whole picture, this whole view, that could have been operating in the background – and that’s this right hemisphere view. Restoration of this natural balance is an interesting way of explaining some of what’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies of lateral changes to brain blood flow and metabolism – brain regions’ use of glucose – that Levin analyzed showed signs of heavy activity in the frontal lobes in the right hemisphere as well as an overall rightward shift in metabolic activity under psychedelics, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing evidence that mindfulness meditation practice is linked to building new networks in the brain and increasing brain thickness in the right hemisphere is relevant to the HEALS theory, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychedelics have been linked to improvements in mindfulness with just one or two uses. And sometimes these capacities are almost at levels consistent with practiced meditators,” Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it likely, to me, that many core right-sided networks that are enhanced with practicing meditation might be enhanced briefly, or maybe longer, through psychedelics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s an opportunity after the use of psychedelics to increase and sustain mindfulness capacities in these areas of the right hemisphere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of psychedelic research is focused on therapeutic applications at Ohio State and elsewhere, but Levin expects that expansion of the field will stimulate pursuit of other research questions – including testing theories about how these substances act on the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He considers HEALS a complement to earlier theories about psychedelic action, and expects the growth in research to produce more hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think to explain something as complex as the brain, especially in the human being, you need a variety of theories to more closely approximate what’s actually happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we get too fixated on one explanation or the other, we’re going to lose track of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2142404d4556444d4d0f101410614e52540f444554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241303599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Levin et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current models of psychedelic action in the brain propose changes along the dorsal–ventral and anterior–posterior axes but neglect to address the lateral axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a novel model of psychedelic action called HEALS (Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics) which involves the reversal of the typical hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical modes of consciousness, the hemispheres act in parallel process with the left predominating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under psychedelics, as well as in other altered states of consciousness (ASCs), this hierarchy is reversed, with the right hemisphere released from inhibition by the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this model, the available neuroimaging evidence for lateralization under psychedelics is reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, various cognitive and emotional changes observed under psychedelics are contrasted with those same functions in each hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include attention; social and emotional intelligence; creativity and insight; and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article concludes with a review of laterality in other ASCs, such as meditative and trance states, and suggests that many phenomena associated with psychedelics, and other ASCs, might be explained by an atypical annealing between the hemispheres toward right hemisphere predominance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 14:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1QOVA2WExaZ1BsZmZib2FMXzVlbjdEVzB5QVpYcHc2YTRDems4RU5kbWtLVU1EdHFkOC1MNGZ4YnNjRWtiN3pLb0FEd3V4UU9FeVNIeXFtU0dUeGRNSjIzOVVBRjdCR2xGSkNETE1tWG5JZk3SAXhBVV95cUxNRnBiY3RKY0owdzV3TjVvRHpZTkNLeEE4S1Q3UHo5bG5KWW1zVmwyMDBJUkRNMkpRTVNqcS1feVg1RGFKUDQ5dTlIRlFqSjBFM092ejRZZzA3dlNUVWk2dFhvd19acDRHVUVVTG00SHBMTTZhSS1fbDU</guid></item><item><title>流行的注射减肥药物对单一性别更有效。研究人员想知道原因- CNN | Popular injected weight loss medications work better for one sex.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao47qba000t27pg026x39ff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard the stories: For every man who has cut carbs from his diet and dropped 10 pounds, there’s a woman who’s done exactly the same thing and lost 2. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40100584/" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this frustrating fact. Diet and exercise tend to benefit men much more than women when it comes to losing weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00042e6adrvw10y4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why the results of recent clinical trials were surprising — and welcome — for some: In study after study, injected GLP-1 weight loss medications appear to work better on average for women than they do for men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc8d3n00033b6mqsm17tl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s not clear is why. And researchers say it’s important to understand so doctors can optimize the use of these powerful drugs for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00052e6ao7pvpjeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" target="_blank"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; to see this effect was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Congress on Obesity and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoi2h7600063b6m32il0nu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the first head-to-head comparison of the injectable GLP-1 medications semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are sold under the brand names Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss. Roughly 750 people with obesity were randomly split into two groups. Half were assigned to get the maximum dose of Wegovy they could tolerate; the other half used the maximum dose of Zepbound.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc9zb900053b6mer5ijmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zepbound is newer medication than Wegovy. It stimulates two different gut hormones that affect appetite and blood sugar, while Wegovy primarily affects the action of one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00072e6ab9a92eds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors have observed that Zepbound seems to be a more powerful medication than Wegovy, so it was not surprising when this trial – which was sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Zepbound – arrived at the same conclusion. People in the study who were using Zepbound lost about 50% more weight those who got Wegovy, making it the superior drug&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in terms of weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00082e6aadopkslk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One curious thing about the study was that all the participants lost a little bit less weight, on average, than has been measured with the same medications in other trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00092e6af9vua676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers say that result was driven by men, who lost about 6% less weight than women. About 35% of participants in this study were men, while 20% to 25% of participants in previous trials have been male.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000a2e6alfszdy69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why this works better in women, I can’t honestly tell you, but it’s great,” said Dr. Louis Aronne, who directs the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and who led the study. “It has been seen again and again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000b2e6ay99ex51q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11271387/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term follow up&lt;/a&gt; of a trial that compared semaglutide to a placebo, women using semaglutide for two years lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, while men using the drug lost an average of 8%. Across &lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/media-centre/#!resources/b-body-weight-reduction-with-tirzepatide-by-sex-a-subgroup-analysis-of-the-surmount-clinical-trials-b-8475ab5a-d4b6-4545-b9c5-ad8b1c8a266e" target="_blank"&gt;trials of tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; that compared it to a placebo, women on the drug lost up to 28% of their starting weight, while men lost up to 19% of their weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000c2e6abpypxpyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There could be a host of reasons for this, spanning numerous aspects of biology and culture, said Dr. Melanie Jay, an obesity expert and professor of medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000d2e6abzz464bd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first has to do with drug dosing. Women tend to weigh a little bit less than men but are prescribed the same doses, so it may be that they’re getting more for their size. “So maybe they’re getting a higher dose,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000e2e6avz82zumq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It might also have something to do with where women store fat. Jay said women tend to have more cutaneous fat, or fat under their skin, than visceral fat, or fat that’s packed around the internal organs like the liver. Perhaps the drugs are more effective on one type of fat than the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000f2e6abhrg32iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women also face more societal pressure to be thin, Jay said, and this could lead to greater motivation to stay on the medications, which aren’t always easy to take.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000g2e6af62rvj44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said she’s seen this in her own practice. Women seem to be more willing to tolerate and work through the significant side effects of the drugs, which can include regular nausea, vomiting and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000h2e6aqjn0s081@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have had a few more men be like, ‘I can’t take the constipation or the nausea,’ whereas the women usually figure out how to get through it,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000i2e6aypgrg267@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the side effects tend to get better over time, as people learn how to eat differently and start to exercise more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000j2e6ajgnrgifu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the most intriguing clues to explain why women benefit more from the GLP-1 medications has to do with the hormone estrogen, which women have in higher amounts than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000k2e6atiqif4hl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Karolina Skibicka is a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and has a lab in the nutrition department at Penn State University. “Overall, I’m a neuroscientist interested in gut-brain communication,” which is how she began studying GLP-1, a gut hormone that also works in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000m2e6amvr8j3ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Skibicka says scientists have known that estrogen plays a role in metabolism for about 30 years, but they didn’t really understand how. Her research in rats has shown that estrogen directly interacts with GLP-1 and other gut hormones, making them more potent in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000o2e6au3wxlyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several studies have shown that if you inject rats with GLP-1 and estrogen together, “you will see a very enhanced effect sort of across the board, on feeding behavior, motivated behavior, various other aspects of GLP-1 actions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000p2e6acu65yl4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can test this interaction in a another way, she said. If you block the action of estrogen with a chemical inhibitor, it turns down the effect of GLP-1, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000q2e6ai9ybkbr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we take it away, the effect is reduced, so the animals will eat a little bit more now, or GLP-1 is just not as effective as suppressing feeding or suppressing food reward behavior, maybe more specifically, when we take away estrogen,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000r2e6abnybakm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen appears to amplify the effects of GLP-1 by increasing the number of receptors — think of them as boat docks — on the surface of cells where this gut hormone can attach. In many tissues, she says, cells have receptors for both estrogen and GLP-1. “So then you sort of have an amplified effect inside the cell as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000s2e6acvyfg7bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although all of these theories are interesting, they are just educated guesses at this point.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000u2e6avg8bm40p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re really dealing with paucity of data compared to just sort of the baseline data that you have about what GLP-1 does,” Skibicka said. “Clinical studies don’t really ask and don’t really confirm why they see a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000t2e6ay7od5e29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Jay and Skibicka said sex differences typically go unexplored when it comes to drugs, and the GLP-1 medications are no exception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000v2e6ankn3wycf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In studies that do report data by sex, women may lose 50% to 90% more weight than men, but they also seem to report more GI side effects, Skibicka said. Men seem to get more cardiovascular benefits from the medications than women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000w2e6a82emqtbw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most studies don’t find that GLP-1 medications negatively affect mood,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;some have shown that this may differ by sex, with women being more likely to experience depression on the medications than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc5ikw00003b6mpf97ludf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Understanding the impacts of these sex differences could be important for all patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000x2e6aahuuph1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If estrogen affects how strongly the medications work, that may have implications for the treatment of women before or after menopause&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;since estrogen levels fall in women as they age. It may also impact how well GLP-1 medications work for women on hormone-blocking therapies after breast cancer, for example. It may lead to strategies that help nonresponders, the people who don’t seem to lose weight on the drugs, and people who stop losing weight before they reach their weight loss goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000y2e6aqugxjdzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said that understanding the mechanisms behind the sex differences could help with adherence to the medications, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000z2e6ajpbhma2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think those things are really important to know, because maybe there’s something else that we could give men alongside it that could enhance it … or we could change the dosing,” Jay said. “Men and women have different biologies, and we can’t treat them always the same.”

The figure estimated to be even higher in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'UPFs are generally prepackaged and kept for several weeks, months or even years in their packaging,' the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many are even directly heated in their packaging (for example, ready-to-eat dishes in plastic trays reheated in the microwave), enhancing the migration of FCCs ( chemicals) into food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added that the processing that occurs to create these foods in massive industrial cooking processes could also be exposing them to plastic materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author of the report, Jane Muncke added that while research on the harms posed by UPFs was still ongoing, data was strong enough that governments should act to limit their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The evidence is becoming more and more clear that today’s packaged ultra-processed foods are convenient and hyperpalatable, but they contain many synthetic chemicals and microplastics from various sources,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We see that the health impacts of this type of food contamination are currently under-appreciated and under-studied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from Toxic Free Future shows how toxic PFAS chemicals get into food products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through.

New research in fruit flies and rodents reveals that astrocytes don’t just support neurons—they selectively respond to neurotransmitters and influence which neural signals are prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These glial cells, which make up over a third of brain cells, can gate synaptic input, helping the brain focus and adapt in real time. By manipulating this astrocyte-driven signaling, scientists were even able to alter behavior in fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Modulators:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes can turn specific neuronal inputs on or off, filtering brain activity in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Manipulating astrocyte signaling disrupted behavior in fruit flies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes may be crucial in treating disorders involving attention, mood, and neurodegeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Sciences University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An often-ignored type of cell in the brain plays a dynamic and surprisingly complex role in our ability to process information, according to new research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, provides direct evidence for the real-time action of a star-shaped type of glial cell, known as astrocytes, in the live brains of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110014"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an astrocyte." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-information-processing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The discovery was replicated in the astrocytes of rodents, suggesting it’s an ancient feature of evolution likely to be conserved in other mammals including people. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abundant cell type — roughly 35% of all cells in the human brain — appears to be a key part of orchestrating a complex network governing brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this begins to fundamentally change how the field thinks about astrocytes and their role in mediating neurophysiology and behavior,” said senior author Marc Freeman, Ph.D., director of the OHSU Vollum Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the long run, it should change how people think about developing therapies for regulation of attention, anxiety and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was replicated in the astrocytes of rodents, suggesting it’s an ancient feature of evolution likely to be conserved in other mammals including people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s evolutionarily relevant to survival,” said lead author Kevin Guttenplan, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scientist in Freeman’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a tiger’s behind you, you need to rapidly change how whole brain regions are thinking — it’s time to shut out everything else on your mind and entirely focus the brain on escaping. It’s not the time to think about anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time, astrocytes were thought to serve only a supporting role by providing food and removing waste for neurons, the cells that form the brain’s “hardwiring” by transmitting signals enabling us to think, act and feel sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Freeman and collaborators documented for the first time that astrocytes also transmit signals between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on that discovery, researchers show some of the specific mechanisms revealing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; those cells transmit signals. It turns out to be a highly complex interplay in which astrocytes can turn on and off their ability to respond to chemical neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Astrocytes are really big, and a single cell can have 100,000 synapses capable of sending signals to other cells,” Guttenplan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism allows them to choose which neurons to listen to. Being able to turn off some of those circuits allows astrocytes to make sense of the cacophony of activity occurring in in the brain from moment to moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that by manipulating this gating pathway within astrocytes, they were able to disrupt the behavior of the fruit flies — highlighting the fact that these small changes can have a potent impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Astrocytes may be the key’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have previously assumed astrocytes to be a much more passive player in brain physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows the importance of astrocytes in neuronal activity and behavior,” said Miriam Leenders, Ph.D., program director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also demonstrates how fundamental neuroscience studies in model systems like the fruit fly can provide pivotal new insights into brain physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research reveals that astrocytes can directly respond to messages from all types of neurons. In this way, they play a role in the complex network of neuronal signaling that drives cognition and controls physical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they found these responses change dynamically with brain state, allowing astrocytes to orchestrate the complex network of neurons enabling the brain to attend to the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cells &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; actively control neuronal activity, really powerfully,” Guttenplan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, scientists caution that the discovery complicates scientific understanding of how the brain functions. Imagine a single astrocyte bristling with thousands of synapses whose gating mechanisms may be alternately activated or silenced by myriad cues swirling around it. And then multiply it by millions of astrocytes throughout the entire human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s overwhelmingly complicated,” Guttenplan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers are increasingly finding evidence that glial cells play a role in brain injuries and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Improving scientific understanding about how these cells function could help to prevent disease or develop treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some of these conditions, things like focus and attention get disrupted,” Guttenplan said. “Astrocytes may be the key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Freeman and Guttenplan, co-authors include Isa Maxwell, B.A., Erin Santos, B.A., Luke A.

Specifically, how astrocytes respond to different neurotransmitters in vivo and how they affect downstream circuit modulation are questions that remain to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report a mechanism in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; by which G protein–coupled adrenergic signaling in astrocytes can control—or “gate”—their ability to respond to other neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gating mechanism is conserved in cultured primary mammalian astrocytes, suggesting that it might be an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our work establishes a mechanism by which astrocytes dynamically respond to and modulate neuronal activity in different brain regions and in different behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 13:45:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9JNzVFY3A5aVFUalVtdXkxYWktNU9xUjRmb003TWNfN2d3ODhudENYTVhwSF9fRDFaQ0dTcGhyUFBOOEEtTVBRTHVPVGFLcHhOS0FqTnZVZGFZaWNHLWktdWJzMW1WTERyZUQwSm5PZTFxUkpycjU0Yw</guid></item><item><title>这种类型的食物只是与心脏病和严重的脑部疾病有关-而且可能在你的储藏室里-女性健康 | This Type Of Food Was Just Linked To Heart Disease And A Serious Brain Condition—And It's Probably In Your Pantry - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPUnN6bVdaanM0S0Z6S1lzN0hLTWxlLThuZ005bFhzSXpRbS1CdlBseEYtUXFPeFpZWG5iZjBmcXpzMk80ZkZTZzVmbUNKQkp5QnZkRU4wOWYyZTBiTWpKTmM4bVBhaEJaVUFPaXJUTkhfQm1ZQ254U001cG1OdjBIU29BUXo1TmxnTUtxYjNXT2NKa256QXUwNmRUSUpYOXpvZVI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;Two new studies on ultra-processed foods link them to a higher risk of developing heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62081923/parkinsons-disease-gut-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62081923/parkinsons-disease-gut-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Parkinson’s disease" data-node-id="0.0.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Ultra-processed foods make up around &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a64728479/ultraprocessed-foods-list-health-effects/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a64728479/ultraprocessed-foods-list-health-effects/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="70 percent of America's food supply" data-node-id="0.1.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;70 percent of America's food supply&lt;/a&gt;, so they're hard to eliminate entirely. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;But eating too much could impact your heart and brain health by increasing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64523770/how-to-naturally-reduce-inflammation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64523770/how-to-naturally-reduce-inflammation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" data-node-id="0.2.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="1" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you haven't stayed up-to-date on health news lately, here's a quick headline for you: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63975057/ultra-processed-foods-biological-aging-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63975057/ultra-processed-foods-biological-aging-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ultra-processed foods" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; aren’t so great for your health.

The researchers divided the participants into five groups based on how much ultra-processed foods they ate per day. They discovered that people who ate 11 or more servings of ultra-processed foods a day had a 2.5 times higher risk of having three or more early signs of Parkinson’s disease than those who had less than three servings a day. (Those early signs included things like rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, constipation, depressive symptoms, body pain, impaired color vision, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a reduced ability to smell.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's important to point out that what the researchers counted as a "serving" can really add up.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence"&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; is a broad term encompassing many different subtypes, from apps that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-unveils-powerful-new-ai-said-to-out-think-chatgpt"&gt;write poetry&lt;/a&gt; to algorithms that are able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-combed-millions-of-images-of-the-arctic-it-found-an-alarming-pattern"&gt;spot patterns&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise get missed – and now AI modeling has just played a major role in an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) used AI to discover that a gene recognized as a sign of Alzheimer's disease could be causing it too. It highlights one of the big challenges in the study of Alzheimer's: understanding both the changes the disease causes, and the changes that cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzyme called phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and the gene that encodes it, were the focus here. The researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2022.02.008"&gt;previously established&lt;/a&gt; the gene was typically more active in people with faster-progressing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg" alt="PHGDH graphic" class="wp-image-161111 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study looked at the influence of the PHGDH gene. (Zhong lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What wasn't clear was what was driving this link. The team used AI to model the structure of the PHGDH enzyme more fully, suggesting it had a previously hidden function: flicking switches for other specific genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed PHGDH interacting with two genes inside brain cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"&gt;known as astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, in ways that interfere with the brain's ability to regulate inflammation and clear out waste. The researchers think this could be one of the tipping points triggering Alzheimer's, and explaining the association between PHGDH and the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; bioengineer Sheng Zhong, from UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated ways to inhibit PHGDH, but only partly – ideally, a drug would block its ability to regulate genes in astrocytes, while still allowing it to perform its vital enzymatic role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a molecule called NCT-503 that fit the bill. AI modeling was deployed again to examine the structure of this molecule, and how it interacts with PHGDH. NCT-503 seems to bind to a pocket in PHGDH to stop its unauthorized gene-switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go before an actual Alzheimer's drug might be developed from this finding, but the research has shown that a treatment based on NCT-503 can put up guardrails around PHGDH in mouse models of the disease. The mice that were treated showed improvements in memory and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;anxiety tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, NCT-503 is able to pass the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; to access neurons and their associated cells, making the new treatment research even more promising. Drugs based on the molecule could even be taken orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's taking time to unpick the complexities of Alzheimer's disease, and all the different factors involved in its development – from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stressful-life-events-linked-to-alzheimers-biomarkers-study-finds"&gt;environmental stresses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;inherited genetics&lt;/a&gt; – each new study gets us a step closer to solutions, and improving how we tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer's disease are very limited," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong. "And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When these neurons were silenced in diabetic mice, blood sugar normalized for months, even without changes in weight or food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-standing beliefs that obesity and insulin resistance are the sole drivers of diabetes.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurons are playing an outsized role in hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes,” said UW Medicine endocrinologist Dr. Michael Schwartz, corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if these neurons contribute to elevated blood sugar in diabetic mice, researchers employed a widely used viral genetics approach to make AgRP neurons express tetanus toxin, which prevents the neurons from communicating with other neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, this intervention normalized high blood sugar for months, despite having no effect on body weight or food consumption.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom is that diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, stems from a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, including obesity, lack of physical activity and poor diet. This mix of factors leads to insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, scientists have traditionally thought the brain doesn’t play a role in type 2 diabetes, according to Schwartz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he paper challenges this and is a “departure from the conventional wisdom of what causes diabetes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings align with studies published by the same scientists showing that injection of a peptide called FGF1 directly into the brain also causes diabetes remission in mice. This effect was subsequently shown to involve sustained inhibition of AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the data suggest that, while these neurons are important for controlling blood sugar in diabetes, they don’t play a major role in causing obesity in these mice, the researchers noted in their report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, targeting these neurons may not reverse obesity, even as it causes diabetes to go into remission, Schwartz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed on how to regulate activity in these neurons, and how they become hyperactive in the first place, he said. Once these questions are answered, Schwartz said that a therapeutic approach might then be developed to calm them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could represent a shift in how clinicians understand and treat this chronic disease, Schwartz said.  He noted, for instance, that Ozempic and other new drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes are also able to inhibit AgRP neurons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent to which this effect contributes to the antidiabetic action of these drugs is unknown.

Convergent evidence implicates inhibition of a particular subset of neurons as a mediator of this FGF1 effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, AgRP neurons, which are located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and are hyperactive in Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and other rodent models of T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether chronic AgRP neuron inactivation mimics the antidiabetic action of FGF1, we directed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a cre-inducible tetanus toxin–GFP (TeTx-GFP) cassette (or cre-inducible AAV GFP control) to the ARC of obese, diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in which cre recombinase is expressed solely by AgRP neurons (Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; AgRP-Cre mice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report that over a 10-wk period of observation, hyperglycemia was fully normalized by AgRP neuron inactivation. In contrast, changes in energy homeostasis parameters (food intake, energy expenditure, body weight, and fat mass) were not observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that in diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, AgRP neuron hyperactivity is required for hyperglycemia but is dispensable for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5WYm5VajhKa08zVnZXZUhtcUNmcUZWaG50a2FLcWk4VGNkTUtrcGVlMGZtNGFXWkgwenB3RFNCWUV2RFdsNnFELVh3bFJ2ZDdLWVcyb3U4Yk9UZXJiOHgxR1hRWFFBQQ</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界高血压日：医生分享管理高血压的7个生活方式技巧-印度斯坦时报 | World Hypertension Day 2025: Doctor shares 7 lifestyle tips to manage high blood pressure - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/world-hypertension-day-2025-doctor-shares-7-lifestyle-tips-to-manage-high-blood-pressure-101747395296198.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called a silent killer, it can quietly pave the way for serious health issues, including heart disease and other chronic conditions.

Keep a healthy weight:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much body weight overworks the heart and raises blood pressure. Try to have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. Reducing even a little weight can decrease blood pressure markedly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Follow a balanced diet:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy foods. Use less than 5 grams of salt daily. Cut back on saturated fats and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Exercise daily:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active for a minimum of 30 minutes every day, most days. Regular activity like brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or yoga maintains blood pressure at a healthy level. Exercise also lowers stress levels, another cause of hypertension. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/struggling-with-hypertension-this-new-kidney-based-treatment-could-be-a-gamechanger-101737210859592.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Struggling with hypertension?

Reduce alcohol and stop smoking:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy drinking can increase blood pressure and harm the heart. Smoking clogs arteries and puts more strain on the heart. Stopping smoking makes a significant impact on cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Manage stress:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Managed Chronic stress is a cause of high blood pressure. Practice relaxation skills like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness. Get enough sleep and maintain work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Check blood pressure often:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your readings in check, particularly if you have a family history. Use a home monitor or see a healthcare provider regularly for check-ups. Early detection is crucial to successful management. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/indian-lifestyle-and-hypertension-5-key-modifications-to-keep-blood-pressure-and-heart-health-in-check-101718954305989.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.

A new study overturns this long-held view, revealing that astrocytes—support cells long considered secondary—are the key intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When norepinephrine is released in the brain, astrocytes detect it and release their own chemical messengers, dampening synaptic activity and reorganizing neuronal connections. Even when neurons can’t sense norepinephrine, these changes persist, as long as astrocytes remain responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrocyte Mediation:&lt;/strong&gt; Norepinephrine reorganizes brain activity through astrocytes, not neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Dampening:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes release a secondary signal that weakens synaptic connections in response to norepinephrine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting astrocytes may improve treatment of attention and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have upended decades-old dogma of how connections between brain cells are rearranged during states of heightened vigilance or attention. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that a brain chemical associated with alertness, attention and learning alters brain connectivity and function not by acting directly on neurons, the cells known for their quick transmission of information, but through the work of astrocytes, another, slower-acting type of brain cell that is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; May 15, fundamentally changes current understanding about the determinants of brain network communication and activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for greater focus on astrocytes as therapeutic targets in the treatment of attention, memory and emotional disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Textbooks tell us that neuromodulators like norepinephrine fine-tune neurons directly — in fact, textbooks tell us that everything in the brain is about neurons,” said Thomas Papouin, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at WashU Medicine and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that a lot of brain wiring and activity is probably orchestrated by astrocytes, on slower timescales. This is the type of discovery that profoundly reshapes our understanding of how the brain works.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the brain’s wallflower to center stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the brain to dedicate itself to tasks that need attention, or to respond to unexpected stimuli like a fire alarm, it needs to be able to rewire itself by changing how brain cells communicate. This process is driven by the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators, including norepinephrine, in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these neuromodulators reorganize communication in the brain is poorly understood. The assumption for the past 80 years has been that neuromodulator chemicals act on neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for at least 30 years astrocytes have been shown to contact and interact with synapses, which are the specialized structures where neurons communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long suspected that astrocytes had the potential to rearrange communication between neurons and, therefore, the flow of information in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their very fine and sprawling shape, these cells are ideally positioned to monitor and detect neuromodulators like norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to test the idea that perhaps neuromodulation of synapses by norepinephrine is an astrocyte business,” Papouin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, Papouin and his team stimulated norepinephrine secretion from mouse brain cells or exposed mouse brain slices to norepinephrine and found that norepinephrine weakened connections between neurons, as known for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers found that norepinephrine also triggered activity among surrounding astrocytes. Once triggered by norepinephrine, astrocytes produced a second chemical that they released onto synapses, which caused the dampening of synapse activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when neurons’ ability to directly sense norepinephrine was removed, norepinephrine was still able to rearrange neuronal connections. When astrocytes’ ability to sense or respond to norepinephrine were taken offline, on the other hand, norepinephrine was unable to reorganize neuronal connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that neuromodulators such as norepinephrine rearrange neuronal connections in the brain by signaling through astrocytes rather than directly onto neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also suggest that targeting astrocytes could be an effective way to reshape brain activity to potentially treat brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papouin’s team has started looking at existing drugs that are believed to act on neurons, to see if they require astrocytes to be effective. If so, perhaps astrocytes could be targeted directly for therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many drugs out there that interfere with norepinephrine signaling in the brain, in particular in the treatment of ADHD or depression. I wonder how many of them require astrocytes to modify brain activity,” said Papouin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health grants R01MH127163-01, R01DK128475, R01NS102272 and R01HL31113-30, Department of Defense grant W911NF-21-1-0312, The Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation, NARSAD Young Investigator Award 28616, The Whitehall Foundation grant 2020-08-35 and The McDonnell Center for Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology Award 22-3930-26275U.

Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:30:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBfY0M3MlByLTlINU9SVWNkamFvbEY3VG5KV0VGeGpaQWVfcUZaQWI5NEMyNlJHYWVDdGk1bGJQN1ZHWWpIVE9oMHlxOW5adjNZNEFPWVJQcVVtUDd6ck9DVnJWRlBjajNaYTVKbXB0aHRiTUxy</guid></item><item><title>轻快地走到一万步：科学家揭示了降低癌症风险的最佳步行方式-印度时报 | Brisk walking to 10,000 steps: Scientist reveals the best walking styles to lower cancer risk - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world increasingly grows sedentary, walking is the easiest and most effective way to stay active, release stress, and maintain mental sanity. While walking in any form has some benefit or another, tweaking your walking style to match your age or requirement may bring more benefits.For instance, backward walking is considered beneficial for cognitive health, brisk walking can do wonders for your heart health. Certain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/walking-styles" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walking styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; can lower the cancer risk, according to University of Oxford researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cases in young people are growing and most of them are linked to lifestyle factors. Being sedentary itself may increase risk of several cancers including colon, endometrial, and lung cancer, according to National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that being active and increasing your step count can reverse cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies in the past have proved that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of cancer. In the new study, scientists highlight the wonderful benefits of walking for reducing the risk of 13 different types of cancer and also suggest the kind of walking that can help bring down the risk further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved over 85,000 people in the UK, and found that the more steps you take each day, the lower your chances of developing up to 13 different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activity of the participants was monitored using activity trackers, where the amount and intensity of the movement were measured. The participants were followed up six years later, and it was clear that more steps lowered cancer risk, regardless of the pace of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10,000 steps: The ideal way to &lt;keyword id="25304948" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="reduce-cancer-risk" source="keywords"&gt;reduce cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained that the benefits started at around 5,000 steps a day. Lesser steps than these didn't offer much protection. Increasing the step count to 11,000 dropped the risk of developing cancer by 11%. When the step count was increased to 9,000 steps, it dropped by 16%. Beyond 9,000 steps, however, the benefits didn't increase further and the difference in risk reduction became marginal, and varied slightly between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the popular recommendation of aiming for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/10000-steps-a-day" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; – not just for general health, but potentially for cancer prevention too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brisk walking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also analysed if the speed of walking was connected to reduced cancer risk and found that brisk walking indeed lowered the risk but when the total physical activity was taken into account, the speed of walking no longer made a significant difference. It was concluded that the total amount of walking matters and not the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Light activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting could significantly increase risk of chronic diseases, including cancer risk. Scientists found that replacing sitting with either light or moderate activity could lower cancer risk. However, swapping light activity for moderate activity didn't accrue additional benefits, as per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing your physical activity levels could reduce the risk of six cancers - gastric, bladder, liver, endometrial, lung and head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers considered the 13 specific cancers, including oesophageal, liver, lung, kidney, gastric, endometrial, myeloid leukaemia, myeloma, colon, head and neck, rectal, bladder and breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the six-year study period, around 3% of participants developed one of these cancers. The most common were colon, rectal, and lung cancers in men, and breast, colon, endometrial, and lung cancers in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking just two miles a day – roughly 4,000 steps, or about 40 minutes of light walking – could make a significant impact on your long-term health. You don't have to do it all at once either. Break it up throughout the day by: taking the stairs instead of the lift; having a stroll at lunchtime; walking during phone calls; parking a bit further away from your destination," said Mhairi A Morris, Cancer educator &amp;amp; Biochemistry Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, in a piece for The Conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Research: Walking 10,000 steps per day reduces risk of dementia, cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 11:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>专家说，鲜为人知的指尖变化是致命癌症正在上升的早期迹象-每日邮报 | Little-known change to your FINGERTIPS is an early sign of deadly cancer that's on the rise, experts say - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics and campaigners have warned the public to pay attention to changes to their fingertips, as a specific alteration could be a red flag sign of lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b86201f0-323d-11f0-85df-17851093755f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well-recognised signs of the deadly disease include a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14710921/non-smoker-lung-cancer-sign-shoulder-pain.html"&gt; persistent cough&lt;/a&gt; and breathlessness, but experts have now flagged a lesser-known, unusual symptom that affects the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Swelling in the fingertips, known medically as finger clubbing, is a known sign of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to be a result of a number of factors, including substances released by certain lung tumours that inflame the bones in the fingers, and harmful chemicals produced by the body that fuel cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem can appear as swollen fingers, as well as a change in the shape of the nail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, a former patient whose only symptom was finger clubbing has warned others to be aware of the unusual sign and take action quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Go and see your doctor—that's what a GP is for,' Brian Gemmell, a fitness instructor from East Kilbride, Scotland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/lung-cancer-doctors-say-early-35229827"&gt;The Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. 'Go as soon as you can.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Gemell previously told The Roy Castle Lung Foundation that he suffered no cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telltale signs of finger clubbing include softening of the nail, red and shiny skin around the nail and ridges along the length of it, according to Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I was feeling healthy,' he said. 'I wasn’t coughing up blood, I wasn’t breathless. My one and only symptom was clubbing of the fingers, where all your fingers swell up and when you put your fingers together you can’t see a diamond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was my only symptom. Straightaway, my GP had an idea of what it was.

While the condition typically takes years to develop, it can happen quicker if there is certain complications such as a lung infection, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/mesothelioma/symptoms/finger-clubbing#:~:text=Finger%20clubbing%20can%20be%20a,ulcerative%20colitis%20and%20Crohn's%20disease."&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, extra areas of bone can form on the finger joints, wrists and even ankles—a condition which is known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), and is often mistaken for arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of lung cancer are often not noticeable until the cancer has spread through the lungs, to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone with finger clubbing will have lung cancer, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the charity advises those who think they may have it to contact their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes as Figures from Cancer Research UK show cases of all types of lung cancer have risen by 130 per cent in young women over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes them the fastest growing group at risk of the disease — although over-70s are still most likely to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates among men of the same age have barely budged from the early 90s, for reasons that medics say are simply unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned against viewing the deadliest form of cancer as a disease that predominately affects old people—as it has previously been seen—as cases rise among never-smokers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, lung cancer in people who have never smoked is now the fifth highest cause of cancer deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the cancer include a persistent cough that doesn't go away after three weeks, repeated chest infections, coughing up blood, pain while breathing, persistent breathlessness and fatigue, and unexpected weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other, more unusual signs of lung cancer include change in the appearance of your fingers, difficulty or pain swallowing, wheezing, changes in your voice, and swelling of the face or neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>减缓阿尔茨海默氏症的药物是安全有效的，真实世界的数据显示- AOL.com | Drug that slows Alzheimer's is safe and effective, real-world data shows - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9CNHc5enhCNGg1V08wXzhxc2VWOExFOE1ZeWlJQlZ2dENMNHJURUNPbHZPZ1BySUxDV2xxemluSXRfcUNmeWpKT2oySS1Hak1NeWV0ZlU4UE5uSjdaaGR3Z2xMZXhnMHBsRzhQekgxNW9kellhWXNkWFlfZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The FDA approved lecanemab for Alzheimer’s disease in 2023.

This is a protein that is made in your body and can become misfolded.  When this happens, it can interfere with brain activity and can form clumps called &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid plaques;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt;. This is what happens in Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid misfolding is not the only thing that happens in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease, but it may be one of the first steps in the disease process that leads to memory loss and dementia.”&lt;br&gt;— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In a large clinical trial, people who were treated with lecanemab for 18 months had about 25-30% less decline in their memory and thinking than did people who did not get the medication,” Snider said. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that the people treated with lecanemab did have a loss in their memory and thinking, so the drug did not reverse or completely stop the memory loss, but it did significantly slow it down. Imaging studies showed that the lecanemab also reduced and sometimes cleared the amyloid plaques in the brain,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1.8% of earliest stage Alzheimer’s experience ARIA symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that 1.8% of participants at the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s disease showed symptoms of ARIA, compared to 27% of participants with mild Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis. The clinical trial results showed that people with very mild symptoms likely benefit more from medications like lecanemab (40-50% slowing of decline instead of 25-30%), so people with very mild symptoms have more benefit and fewer side effects. This is also when it is hardest to be sure someone has Alzheimer’s disease, so it is very important that we continue to work to improve access to diagnosis for people with very mild symptoms.”&lt;br&gt;— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snider and her team also discovered that of the 11 participants who experienced ARIA symptoms, the effects mostly disappeared within a few months, and no patients died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is very similar to what was seen in the clinical trial,” Snider commented. “This is very reassuring and tells us that these drugs can be used safely in a ‘real world’ clinic population.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to follow our patients and hope to learn more about side effects of these medications and about how much they slow down memory loss,” she continued. “We look forward to sharing this information with other providers and to seeing larger studies through groups like Alz-Net.  We are encouraged by our experience of providing amyloid-targeting treatments to appropriate patients and we look forward to the next generation of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More research to identify increased ARIA risk needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/22378/john-dickson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John Dickson, MD, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;John Dickson, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, about this study.  Dickson commented that the study’s findings are generally in line with what he has observed at his center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While ARIA does occur in patients treated with lecanemab, it has been manageable in our sub-specialty treatment program,” he explained. “The risk of ARIA is often the most significant consideration in eligible patients’ decisions about whether to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy or not.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research to identify patients at increased risk for ARIA, especially serious ARIA with concerning symptoms or radiographic features, could help clinicians advise patients with more personalized recommendations regarding treatment based on individual patients’ risk profiles. This may help patients make more informed decisions regarding their treatment options. These treatment decisions include whether or not to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy, and if so, whether lecanemab or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/fda-approves-alzheimers-drug-donanemab" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:donanemab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt; would be a better option.”&lt;br&gt;— John Dickson, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickson said that for future research, these findings should be examined in a larger patient sample and that the observation time should be extended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, the risk of ARIA is highest in the first six months of treatment,” he explained. “While some of the patients included in this study had more than six months of treatment, some patients were observed for a shorter period of time. Thus, the results of this study may underestimate the number of patients who will develop ARIA from the study population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits vs. side effects for lecanemab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/manisha-santosh-parulekar/1319173" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the approval of lecanemab offers a glimmer of hope for Alzheimer’s patients, the potential for serious side effects makes it a complex decision for prescribing physicians,” Parulekar said. “Careful patient selection, monitoring, and open communication about the benefits and risks are essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefit offered by lecanemab is a modest slowing of decline, not a cure or a dramatic reversal.

I was told this was due to a lack of iron, as I had low iron levels.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of symptoms meant she was ‘clumsy all the time’ and would often fall over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her long term symptoms and repeated trips to the doctor the tumour was only picked up after she was rushed to hospital following a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thankfully, brain surgery to remove the disease proved successful and her latest scans show no signs of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However she will have regular MRI’s for the next decade and is aware the cancer can return at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regular scans mean 'it'll be caught early if it ever decideds to show up again,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If it ever comes back, I'll be ready.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recovery has not been easy, she told her social media followers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have really struggled to get back into normal life.

Researchers found that people with specific patterns of brain activity and white matter structure performed better in the game StarCraft II, especially when it came to resource-related tasks that require scanning a complex visual environment. The results suggest that efficient attentional processing and underlying neural traits can facilitate skill development in fast-paced gaming environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to manage resources, control armies, and make decisions under time pressure. Unlike action games that rely heavily on reflexes, StarCraft II emphasizes strategic planning and rapid information processing. Because the game demands frequent shifts in visual attention and quick identification of important in-game elements, it offers a unique opportunity to study how cognitive functions like visual search operate in dynamic, realistic settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While research on video games is well-established, only in recent years have we begun to systematically explore their potential benefits for cognitive functioning,” said study author Natalia Jakubowska, an assistant professor at SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities. “At the same time, esports has evolved into a serious discipline, where discussions about individual predispositions—much like in traditional sports—are increasingly common. We became curious whether there might be neurobiological traits that support effective learning or high-level performance in complex games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a more personal level, video games have always been part of my life—I grew up with them, and over time began to look at them through a research lens as well. During my student years, I somehow managed to spend over 1,200 hours playing The Witcher 3. These days I rarely dive into RPGs, but they definitely hold a special (and slightly nostalgic) place in my heart. Being able to combine my scientific interests with a long-standing personal fascination felt like a natural and rewarding direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakubowska and her colleagues designed their study to investigate how attention-related brain activity and brain structure predict success in StarCraft II. They were particularly interested in a brain signal called the N2pc, an electrical pattern measured using electroencephalography (EEG) that reflects how attention is allocated in space. In addition to EEG, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the integrity of white matter pathways in the brain, which are essential for communication between different brain regions. The team wanted to know whether these neural markers, recorded before any gameplay training, could predict how well participants would perform in the game over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 21 non-gamers who received 30 hours of supervised StarCraft II training. Before the training began, all participants completed a visual search task while their brain activity was recorded. This task involved identifying a target shape among distracting shapes—sometimes in an easy “pop-out” condition, and other times in a harder “inefficient” search condition. The N2pc component was extracted from EEG data during these tasks. In parallel, participants underwent diffusion MRI scans to assess white matter integrity in key brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 30 hours of StarCraft II training, detailed in-game telemetry was collected. This included behavioral metrics like resource collection rates, unit production, strategic decision timing, and camera movement. The researchers used statistical modeling to condense these numerous metrics into three main gameplay factors: a “Proficiency Factor” related to strategic skill and unit management, a “Resource Factor” reflecting efficiency in acquiring and using in-game resources, and an “Efficiency Factor” linked to timing and multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed several significant relationships between pre-training brain data and later in-game performance. Participants who showed lower N2pc amplitudes during the inefficient visual search condition performed better on resource-related tasks in StarCraft II. This suggests that those who needed less neural effort to carry out a difficult search task were better equipped to manage resource-gathering strategies in the game. In other words, efficient neural processing of visual information seemed to translate into better gameplay in a visually demanding environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, white matter integrity in two specific brain areas—the right anterior limb of the internal capsule and the left external capsule—was positively associated with the same resource-related gameplay factor. These brain regions are known to connect frontal areas involved in decision-making with subcortical structures that support learning and attention. Higher fractional anisotropy, a measure of white matter coherence, in these regions was linked to both lower N2pc amplitudes and better in-game performance. This suggests a broader interaction between stable brain structure and dynamic attentional processes in shaping how players develop expertise in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by how clearly individual differences emerged even at the pre-training stage—and how well they predicted later in-game performance,” Jakubowska told PsyPost. “This suggests that some people may have neurobiological predispositions for developing specific skills in environments that demand rapid visual information processing—and that these traits can be detected even before any formal training takes place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we were genuinely thrilled that our integrative approach worked so well. This was our first study combining functional (EEG), structural (MRI), and behavioral (telemetry-based game data) perspectives, and despite its methodological complexity, our model held up. We’re especially excited because very few studies to date have managed to integrate all three levels of analysis—particularly using real in-game telemetry rather than artificial lab tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the N2pc amplitude during the easier “pop-out” condition showed a possible relationship with overall strategic proficiency, though this link was weaker. The researchers suggest that the ability to detect salient visual information rapidly might help players with early-stage strategy planning, but more advanced strategic behavior likely draws on a broader set of cognitive skills beyond visual attention alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights that these functional and structural brain measures were not related to each other, but independently contributed to performance. This supports the idea that efficient visual search relies on both moment-to-moment attentional control and long-term neural architecture. The anterior limb of the internal capsule, in particular, connects brain areas involved in planning, learning, and attentional control. Its role in visual search and skill acquisition is consistent with past research showing its importance for cognitive speed and strategy execution. The external capsule, though less understood, also links various brain regions involved in perception and memory, which may aid in complex environmental scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that individuals who are more efficient at processing visual information—for example, locating relevant targets quickly amidst distractions—may have a natural advantage when it comes to performing well in complex strategy games like StarCraft II,” Jakubowska explained. “Interestingly, these differences are reflected not only in behavior, but also in brain activity and white matter structure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that success in video games—at least those that rely heavily on attention and planning—is not solely a matter of practice or habit. It may also relate to individual cognitive and neurobiological traits. More broadly, our findings support the idea that video games can serve as valuable tools for studying human attention and learning in dynamic, real-world-like environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it’s important to remember that performance in games is rarely driven by a single cognitive skill,” Jakubowska continued. “Much depends on the strategy a player adopts, as well as on the specific nature and demands of the game. In our research, we focused on one specific mechanism—selective visual attention—but our findings clearly point to how much remains to be explored. Games like StarCraft II provide a cognitively rich environment that deserves further investigation from multiple angles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And this is just one game—we should keep in mind that the diversity of genres and mechanics in the world of video games offers an even broader landscape for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the authors note several limitations. The study had a relatively small sample size, which means it may not have had enough statistical power to detect smaller effects or allow detailed subgroup comparisons. Participants were also limited to non-gamers, so it remains to be seen whether the same neural patterns would predict performance in experienced players or professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We specifically recruited young adults (aged 18–35) with minimal experience in video games and no prior exposure to RTS, FPS, or TPS titles,” Jakubowska explained. “This made recruitment particularly challenging, but allowed us to control for prior gaming-related cognitive adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to emphasize that this is a preliminary study—we are not yet measuring the effects of training itself, but rather identifying potential predictors of in-game success. Moreover, we focused on a single cognitive mechanism—selective visual attention—and examined it within the context of one game with specific demands. This represents a narrow, but promising, slice of a much broader landscape that warrants further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite these limitations, our findings clearly show that this kind of integrated approach—combining functional, structural, and behavioral data—holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of attention and learning in complex human–computer interaction environments,” Jakubowska said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As interest grows in the potential of video games for cognitive training, this research lays the groundwork for future investigations. Whether the goal is to enhance attention, design better training programs, or understand how the brain supports learning in dynamic settings, real-time strategy games like StarCraft II may continue to offer a powerful and flexible research tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main long-term goal is to expand this line of research by examining other cognitive functions,” Jakubowska said. “In this study, we focused on selective visual attention, but complex video games engage a much broader range of processes—such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and decision-making. We are interested in exploring whether and how these functions are reflected in brain structure, brain activity, and game performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key direction is longitudinal research. We now have data from four time points: before training, and after 10, 30, and 60 hours of gameplay. This gives us a rare opportunity to track how cognitive and neural indicators evolve over time in response to structured, high-intensity training. We’re particularly interested in whether early predispositions remain stable, diminish, or are eventually “caught up” by less initially advantaged participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Equally important is the training environment itself,” Jakubowska continued. “Many cognitive studies rely on overly simplified or repetitive tasks that only superficially resemble real gaming. We aimed to strike a balance between experimental control and ecological validity. Our participants trained in a structured environment where we controlled for difficulty, scenario complexity, and—at later stages—enabled multiplayer interactions. This allowed us to construct two types of training conditions: more “lab-like” and more similar to real-world gaming. I strongly believe that even a highly capable individual may fail to develop cognitively in an inadequate environment—one that is too easy, monotonous, or unengaging. That may help explain why previous findings on the cognitive impact of gaming have been so mixed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the future, I would also love to conduct a comparative study involving professional players. I’m curious whether the differences we observe are purely quantitative—driven by training time and intensity—or whether elite gamers function differently on a qualitative level, both cognitively and neurologically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to the entire research team,” Jakubowska added. “Collecting data from a single participant—four behavioral assessments, four EEG sessions, four MRI scans, and 60 hours of in-lab training—required an enormous amount of coordinated effort. We estimate that each participant accounted for at least 100–120 hours of work, often involving multiple researchers at the same time. This really highlights the scale and dedication needed for studies of this kind, and I am incredibly grateful to everyone who contributed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project also reminded us that while integrated studies—combining neural, behavioral, and environmental data—are deeply fascinating and full of scientific promise, they are also extremely difficult to carry out. The reward of meaningful, high-quality data is often delayed by months or even years of hard work—not to mention the challenges of recruitment, training adherence, and logistical complexity across multiple measurement points.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lastly, I’d like to share a personal belief: I think games, while not always and not all equally, can be a valuable part of our lives,” Jakubowska concluded. “I don’t believe they are harmful in moderation—quite the opposite. Today’s games are not only entertainment tools; they are also complex learning environments, spaces for decision-making, social interaction, and even cultural expression. I believe it’s time we approached them with more openness—including from a scientific perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2025.108689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brainwaves on battlegrounds: Preliminary insights into EEG, white matter microstructure, and StarCraft II performance&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Weronika Nieciecka, Paulina Lewandowska, Stanisław Adamczyk, Alicja Anna Binkowska, Aneta Brzezicka, Patryk Szczeciński, and Natalia Jakubowska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOa1lNOHpFY1JyMmhoOERQc2w4VkV5b2NZV05pM3MyTzFmWC1FYUtUS0l2NVoxTVZNRURiVDdXQlNUZFBGcnZwa3pqSnVwQlJJNWgtdTVaQWRVelgxZ1RWdWNOa0NUQTNNVVVTSU02UUJUbk1wUktyMjJPRVFaUVdHQmVLd1N4TndxWG9ERlhRRTZVR3kzTmhfaWJINWhhWHdPLXFhcV8zYmFPUnFyTXdGLWI3SFp0WDVWZGZUS0dGREdCdXc</guid></item><item><title>O.C.D.看起来可能与您想象的不同-《纽约时报》 | O.C.D.

Some patients obsess over thoughts that they might hurt someone, while others fixate on certain aspects of their personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The comedian Maria Bamford, for example, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/magazine/the-weird-scary-and-ingenious-brain-of-maria-bamford.html" title=""&gt;called her O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt; “unwanted thoughts syndrome.” On “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” she shared a story about how she couldn’t stop thinking horrific thoughts about her family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On social media, people describe many types of obsessions and compulsions: “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kayleebullen/video/7391176157401517355?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;relationship O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt;,” “sexual orientation O.C.D.” or “emotional contamination O.C.D.” These aren’t separate diagnoses, but rather they are different expressions of the same disorder — much like how people with phobias can suffer from different fears, said Dr. Carolyn Rodriguez, an O.C.D. expert and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Understanding these distinctions can help clinicians tailor a precise treatment plan, she added.

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:00
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You've probably heard the term pregnancy brain or baby brain.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Kourtney Kardashian clip
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:04
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I have baby brain. I'm like in a different world. I don't know what day of the week it is, to be honest.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:11
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's a phrase that's often used to mean that someone is kind of scattered or unfocused.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Kourtney Kardashian clip
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love baby brain. I mean, I don't know exactly, I'm not a scientist, but supposedly so that moms focus on their baby, you can't really think of other stuff. And it's true, because I can't think of anything else.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's Kourtney Kardashian, and you know what? She's probably on to something. Because the brain isn't static, even though we often think it is. Our brains are changing, and they change throughout our lives, especially women's brains. They change during the three P's, puberty, pregnancy, and perimenopause. Now for women, these transitions aren't just happening in the body, they are happening in the brain as well. That's a really important point. And it's exactly what cognitive neuroscientist, Dr. Laura Pritschet, studies, how the brain actually changes across the many phases of a woman's life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Laura Pritschet
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And the reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things. At the same time, in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues, specifically in that time. And I thought, we've got to connect these two together and understand this more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:41
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Dr. Pritschet recently published the first-ever longitudinal study, meaning that she actually followed the same person over a long period of time, specifically tracking the brain before, during, and after pregnancy. Not just in a few snapshots, but in these dense, detailed scans that then continued two years after the birth of the baby.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Laura Pritschet
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It showcases this choreographed dance between major features of our brain that are changing over pregnancy itself, which in theory can underlie this sort of preparation for the next stage, which is parenting, caregiving, motherhood.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So I wanted to talk to her about how and why brains change during pregnancy and what those changes might really mean for parenthood and even beyond. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:31
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Was there a specific question that you were trying to answer or were you just trying to establish that there was variations that occurred throughout that time period?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Laura Pritschet
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:41
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'We've begun shedding light on how the brain reorganizes in response to pregnancy. It's a transformative period in a person's life. It's tied to hormonal change, social change, environmental change. But what changes happen during gestation itself? We're missing huge gaps in what we call this sort of metamorphosis. We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus. We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, but we don't know what that looks like. So the question was what does this trajectory look like over gestation and was also the sort of proof of concept to say stuff is changing and we need to study this at length. And so that's what we sought to do just starting with one person. But yeah, that was what we did, this intensive longitudinal design over a single individual who is scanned preconception, during IVF, along all three trimesters into two years postpartum.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:40
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And you noticed objective changes in the brain. Gray matter thickening or thinning, did you say?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Laura Pritschet
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:48
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'So our findings, which looked at a woman's brain pre-peri-postpartum, found that as women advanced through their gestational weeks, zero to 40 weeks, we saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain that was also shown if you look at cortical thinning. We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Okay, let's take a quick step back here. The brain is made up of gray matter and white matter. Now gray matter is where most of the brain's thinking and processing happens. White matter helps connect those areas. Think of it like the wires that let different parts of the brain talk to each other. So when Laura talks about changes in gray matter and white-matter microstructure, she's talking about real physical shifts in how the brain is organized. And possibly how it might function during and after pregnancy.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, the inflection point was birth, and we saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in the early postpartium, others did not, but it showcases this choreographed dance between major features of our brain that are changing over pregnancy itself, which in theory can underlie this sort of preparation for the next stage, which is parenting, caregiving, motherhood.

              'In this one patient, at least even during the IVF cycle, during pregnancy, and then postpartum, you said maybe there was some recovery back to sort of pre-pregnancy brain structures. How far out did you look?

              We studied her up until two years postpartum. We studied and scanned her brain a lot more in the early postpartums. So we have fewer data points one to two years out. But you can look at that trend and you see there's a little bit of partial volume recovery, but it never really goes back to baseline for the gray matter volume.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              'It's interesting because as you point out, so if people who are listening can just imagine the brain and you know people think of brain as gray matter but it's gray matter and white matter. You have gray matter sort of on the outside, you have these white matter tracks deep within the brain. You may have gray-matter what are called nuclei, so these sort of very important areas deep in the center of the brain, you are describing a picture where gray matter sort of shrinks, more so sounds like around the edge, the cortex as it's called. But when that happens, if the volume stays the same, some of those white matter tracks may expand a bit. Some of the natural fluid-filled spaces in the brain may expand a bit to maintain that overall volume. That's the picture you've described as what happens during pregnancy in the brain. Again, not to oversimplify, but is this a good thing or a bad thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So when you hear shrink or like a reduction of volume, right? Most people are going to say, oh, that's not good. And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I've learned anything from talking to people about this paper is, oh yeah, like I could have told you that my brain is shrinking. But in reality, there's likely two things that are going on. One is there's this physiological adaptation to pregnancy itself. So there is going to be some swelling, some cortical pressure, where there's increased blood flow. All of that. And our brain, just like our placenta, our belly, our feet, all of it is gonna be adjusting to meet those demands. Some things will go back to baseline when you don't have that fluid retention. The other thing is, and this is based on evidence not just from our paper, but from everyone in the field that's leading this work is that it's a fine tuning of circuits. We know that pregnancy is the lead up to this time in your life where there's a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur. And a new cognitive demands and a new cognitive load. And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient, to meet the demands that are going to have to occur. And interestingly, we see the exact same pattern in other periods of brain development, like adolescence, right? Adolescence is marked by this onset of hormones and puberty. We see this fine-tuning, gray matter volume reduction, increased white matter and white matter microstructure, a suite of adaptations that have to occur, cognitive mood, behavior changes. But it's specifically, I think, with pregnancy because there is a lot of subjective and sometimes objective changes in cognition. We really tie those changes to like, oh yeah, they're harmful. But in fact, we zoom out and we look at the lifespan. It actually can be beneficial that this is happening. And this is very normal. So don't have to think of it in the sense that there's reduction, so my brain is shrinking and I can't function. And in fact, it's good that this is happening.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Pregnancy brain and I don't know if that's considered a pejorative term if it is I apologize to anybody. But you know being more forgetful, you know things like that, does that translate to being a better mom, I mean like how do you how do your correlate those two things?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's an interesting way to phrase it. And I do think people are trying to rebrand mommy brain or pregnancy brain, albeit that's what the common terms are. So that is interesting because, for a couple of reasons, one is the first sort of pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume, that sort of reduction correlated with various maternal care or maternal behavior. Again, that's all correlation—
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What does that mean? Like what though? Because again, you know, your memory centers are sort of in, you know, you're hippocampus or these certain areas of the brain. With cortical fitting, what did that translate to in terms of what the women were experiencing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:09:48
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So what they found was that reductions in gray matter volume, especially in regions that overlap with theory of mind that are important in caregiving and all of that, emotional processing, higher order cognition, if those areas that changed the greatest, so they had the greatest decline in gray metal volume, which again can be a fine tuning, showed positive associations with bonding with their infant. And they also showed that sort of there was less hostility to their infant. Again, that's an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context, because any time you're about to say, the more forgetful you are, or that you're brain changing, maybe that's out of your control, is gonna predict how good of a mom you are. It's like, just a, like, I don't think we can actually answer that at all, but it is, the overarching question is like, how can we tangibly contextualize that gray matter change? But you can expect that if there's fine tuning in these circuits that underlie sort of cognitive or behavioral process that the more fine tuning and it goes, the better performance you're gonna have. That's the idea, but it's so much more complicated than that. But yeah, there are people who are looking at the degree of cognitive change in relation to how their postpartum experiences are. Now those that are struggling the most that maybe have the greatest degree of cognitive complaints or feel those cognitive change, could be those people that are the most vulnerable to a lot of things that occur in postpartum too, including mood disorders or sleep dysregulation and don't have that support. And all of that compounds your relationship to your offspring, and that's why we need to have as much support in the postpartums as possible.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Okay, after the break, we've talked about how the brain shrinks during pregnancy, but I think the next question is, what happens after that? We're going to dig into how these changes could sharpen social instincts, help people tune into a baby's needs, and also answer the question of what this might all mean for your brain long after the diapers are gone.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So just for the audience, because we're using a lot of neuroscience terms here, you know, talking about cortical thickening and of changes, obviously, in the brain as a result of pregnancy, what do you think the message is there for people?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I think where I always start is that this is a critical period of brain development and there's going to be this period of neuroplasticity, our ability to adapt to physiological and environmental demands where we can ease up on the inhibition and change things as necessary and that's normal and that is really cool and just as you would expect every other part of your body to change, so is pregnancy. And it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a window of opportunity to maybe fine-tune certain circuits, it's also a window of vulnerability. Anytime your brain is in flux or you're in a transition stage, there's going to be vulnerability to, say, mood disorders or neurological-related conditions that we can get into as well. But it's just almost a way to provide quantitative evidence for all of the things that women have been feeling for time and time again, that there's this choreographed dance that's occurring between your gray and your white matter over this gestational period. Ultimately to prepare you or to be able to adapt to all of the demands that are happening now or happening in the future.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This should be reassuring, it sounds like, to some extent.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I think so. And from the people I've spoken to, it's helped them understand a little bit more of why things are happening. And I think anytime you provide evidence that this is occurring, and it can fit within them saying, yeah, if you talk to any person who's gone through pregnancy or parenthood, they're going to say, yeah like my brain feels different now. Like my auditory cortex has to have changed because I hear things differently now. And so to be able to say like, look, that's that region over this gestational period changing is I think reassuring and hopefully interesting. And if we show that and tie it to this message of this is adaptation and it's not this sort of shrinking but rather like this shift, this metamorphosis, this etching, however we wanna package it, it's a really powerful and cool thing that's happening for a reason. And to mostly everyone.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And that reason fundamentally, I mean, and again, I am very careful as a fellow neuroscientist not to oversimplify, but the reason that these brain changes happen, could you make the case that it's to better prepare you, equip you to care for this child?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a leading theory for sure. And I think you have to ask the question of like, anytime that your brain is gonna undergo change like this, it takes a lot of energy and it's resource heavy. And so why would we be doing that if it wasn't for some sort of reason? And pregnancy itself is a central facet of reproductive life that's how we, you know, it's happening ubiquitously across women and 85% of women are gonna experience this.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It does raise this question as well about whether you did, I don't know how old the woman was that you originally did the study on, but would it make a difference for women who are older when they have their children?

So one is the age component. So our subject was 37. And if you hear, I always like to start my lectures or talks with what comes to mind when you hear brain development. And it's always, oh, it's, you know, in utero or infant or adolescent brains. And it really is like the first couple of decades of life. And then I always hear that like 25, your brain is done developing. And then, I showcase this data and I'm like, this is a 37 year old female who look at her trajectories of the brain compared to adolescence. But it opens up and the reason I'm saying that is because another huge question then is, okay, what if you undergo pregnancy at 20 or 18? When there are other sorts of periods of brain development occurring or 40 or 45, how does that influence your menopause trajectory? How does that influenced brain health later on? We don't know. We also have no real idea of what these changes look like in a second or a third pregnancy. If that second pregnancy happens one year later or five years later, low-hanging fruit that we just have not mapped.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's fascinating. So the person you followed through pregnancy was 37 years old. Everyone is different. And you mentioned this at the top, Laura, but how you want to reproduce these findings, obviously, that's the nature of science. So what can we say at this point? How valid do you think the study is in terms of what this means for brain changes and pregnancy overall?
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, so I feel very confident in having spoken to all of my colleagues and all of the pioneers in this field that one of the most consistent findings in neuroscience is this sort of persistent reduction and this that persistent reduction.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Persistent reduction in gray matter and cortical thickness.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly. We see this in about, because other people have looked at this and measured this, maybe not in the way we did, but this sort of snapshot or one or two times during pregnancy now is coming online. And it's just consistent. Like 90% of and above of participants are showing this. We have prelim data from the people who've followed up and done this exact protocol that show nearly the same patterns. And we have all of the translational research too. One, that pregnancy is a period of brain plasticity, and it's a critical window for brain change. And two, that you're gonna see this persistent reduction in gray matter volume and cortical thickness. The white matter microstructure finding that we saw is actually quite interesting because we saw this sort of nonlinear rise, and it said the measure of diffusion along that myelin that's protecting the axon. You can think of it, for anyone listening, is like the integrity of that white matter track to help signal processing is like a weak celery stock or a really fresh celery stock, things like that. We saw this sort of nonlinear rise. It peaked in second trimester and went down to third trimester, and then back to baseline, which kind of fits with anyone who's done the snapshot approach of pre and post pregnancy, seeing no changes in that measure. But I would say that I feel very confident that this is a finding we're going to see. I think there's a lot of signal, because your hormones, which can act as neuromodulators, are rising by 100 to 1,000 fold. In your body, which is the highest it's ever gonna be. And they've really, I think, is hormonally mediated neuroplasticity. So very confident that these changes hold up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And as you said, I guess in some ways this is revelatory, what you found, but not surprising at the same time.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, exactly. And it was really fun to sit with that data and be playing with it and trying to break And I took it to all these different labs, including someone at the National Institute of Health. And I was like, what? This is just so beautiful. Like it has to, it can't be this linear. It can't this like fitting within this literature because it's like that science is so messy. It just was fun to see kind of because you're sitting on data that no one has, at least to our knowledge, published on yet of 26 time points during that perinatal period of a person.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's a pretty laborious study, I mean, you know, congrats to the study subjects, right? If you do become pregnant in your life based on your own research, would you do anything differently? Is there a message in there for women who might be listening who are thinking about pregnancy?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I, yes, I think that I've been asked this a few times and I've thought about it a little bit more. And I think for me, it's, I would feel so much calmer and I do feel calmer going into that life stage, knowing that certain things are normal. And I, I, think of it as like a reference range. That's what I'm trying to build actually right now is if you go get a blood test and you have say like elevated iron, but it's within like the normal range, it doesn't get flagged. That's, what I want to do for brain changes during pregnancy because that can calm me into saying: I know the literature. I know that I'm going to have maybe these memory or attention subjective feelings of that changing. OK, that's fine. Here, I'm just talk to my physician. I'm gonna talk to partner and say, if you're seeing that it's impacting my quality of life and I had more severe version of that, maybe I'll do my own sort of cognitive exams on myself. Why stop? Then I would ask, I would want to talk to a doctor about that. You know, try to seek maybe help there, but knowing what's normal or what to expect and just having more knowledge of what this is gonna be is really helpful to me. Additionally, knowing how vulnerable that first four weeks are in the postpartum, because I've seen hormones, I've see how they drop very steeply in that period and along with this, knowing that this is like one of the most heightened times in a woman's life for mood disorders and it's very prevalent. That I can go into that period knowing I need as much support as possible and here's who I'm gonna ask or I'm going to ask my partner to make sure that they're monitoring myself because you take your baby in and it has all these pediatric visits and you don't have these sort of mental health checks for the moms. You don't as much care for the postpartum mom as I think we should in our healthcare system. I think women should definitely be aware of that and talk to their partner and the people around them to help them. On the science side, we can try to make those reference frames and make the guidelines and try to improve the prediction and the treatment options for pregnant women of who's going to go on to have the most severe decompensation.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I hadn't thought about that last part, starting to be predictive. On one hand, I do find it, like just trying to understand all this, we think that it would be reassuring for people. I think understanding that there are changes that happen in the brain, it's something that is common, it's related to pregnancy in this case that you're talking about. I think that's in some ways reassuring for folks. Thank you for sharing all that with us.

If he survived, he would have severe mental and developmental delays and would eventually need a liver transplant. But half of all babies with the disorder die in the first week of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia offered the Muldoons comfort care for their baby, a chance to forgo aggressive treatments in the face of a grim prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We loved him, and we didn’t want him to be suffering,” Ms. Muldoon said.

			&lt;p&gt;A US infant with a rare condition has become history's first patient to be treated with a personalized gene-editing technique that raises hopes for other people with obscure illnesses, doctors said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wee pioneer is KJ Muldoon, now a 9-and-a-half-month-old boy with chubby cheeks and big blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces an enzyme key to liver function, and prevents people with it from eliminating certain kinds of toxic waste produced by their metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You Google 'CPS1 deficiency' and it's either fatality rate or liver transplant," the baby's mother, Nicole Muldoon, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQWWLErLaY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; in a video released by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the baby was treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUQWWLErLaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the prognosis grim, doctors suggested something that had never been done before: a personalized treatment to fix the baby's genome using what amounts to a pair of molecular scissors – the technique called Crispr-Cas9, which earned its creators the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy's father said he and his wife faced an impossible decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our child is sick. We either have to get a liver transplant or give him this medicine that's never been given to anybody before, right?" said Kyle Muldoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg" alt="A tiny newborn baby" class="size-medium wp-image-161736" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-692x415.jpg 692w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ was only days old when he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder and transferred to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where doctors were actively researching new cell and gene therapies.

It's personalized medicine," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a member of the medical team who specializes in pediatric genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg" alt="World's First Patient Treated With Personalized CRISPR Gene-Editing Therapy" class="size-medium wp-image-161743" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Patient KJ with Drs.

&lt;p&gt;The results were promising for other people with genetic conditions, said the medical team, which published their study Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ can now follow a diet richer in proteins – his condition prohibited such before – and does not need as much medicine as he used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg" alt="KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings" class="size-full wp-image-161732" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings are looking forward to welcoming him home after a first-of-its-kind personalized gene editing therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas said she hoped this achievement will allow the boy to get by with little or no medication some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient's needs," the doctor&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, you read that right. Prolonged sitting is the worst thing you could do for yourself, and it is an invitation to major health issues, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.But in today’s times, where a sedentary lifestyle prevails, with jobs that require to be seated for long hours, how does one find balance? Some youngsters even exceed 8 to 10 hours of prolonged sitting. A groundbreaking study has found that a simple approach can manage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/blood-sugar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; levels, and this doesn’t involve intense workouts or drastic lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374636/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; details how small, regular movement breaks can transform metabolic health, lower blood sugar, and insulin levels.

It means getting up and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/walking" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; or moving around for 2 minutes after every 20-30 minutes of sitting. This micro-activity can break prolonged sitting and improve metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study Biotech &amp;amp; Health Tech Abroad: Top Courses at Harvard, Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher found that people who sat for 8 continuous hours had a drastic spike in their post-meal blood glucose and insulin levels. However, when this pattern was interrupted with just two minutes of light or moderate walking, every 20 to 30 minutes, their blood sugar levels dropped by 24-30% and insulin levels by 23-26% compared to prolonged sitting. These benefits occurred regardless of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/doctor-explains-what-happens-if-one-walks-for-1-minute-to-what-happens-when-one-walks-for-60-minutes/articleshow/121078389.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means even a leisurely stroll can make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear. Sitting for long periods reduces muscle contractions and impairs glucose uptake, which leads to elevated blood sugar, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Regular movement reactivates these processes and helps the body to clear glucose and fats from the bloodstream more effectively. The study’s findings held true across body weight, sex, and baseline fitness levels. What makes the 2 per 20 rule so effective is its focus on movement frequency rather than intensity or calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a desk job, or a sedentary lifestyle, try the 2 per 20 sitting-walking rule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for every 20 to 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get up from your seat, refill your water bottle, or take a stroll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure to walk for at least 2 to 3 minutes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you are on the phone, walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use a smartwatch or step counter to track your movement &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxOMlRObmpRaG42NmtkOERURlVhM0g4ZDhEN2lzbllEUzBYRmpDV0JwbGRCR3Vvb1hya2t4UDV0VV9XbXNmclc0QWFtWGdseWxWM2pndnJUbjhvV1VvQkFPUks0anR4QVdMNzUzc3psX285aWZBd05PV0hOU2JIQTMtOXNaSC1lUnBiRTNnaFRCYjBfRXhqMXd4cEZXZHI4bFVrbWVIdFZzWVp2ZFNiRFdmTmxNSkpjUE84a2MwVnAwSVVwMVd2Z3ZQZTFMUVV2aU1HMFEtemVrbEJOS0FQcTJBcExFdVJDU29xazN4VzIzUXZFOWtPeEh3azhVSU5Ma2lLR2Y1Sl81c0wtTTJhd1BqRnotZWI</guid></item><item><title>Trading Standards - BBC发布的鼻鞣喷雾警告 | Nasal tanning sprays warning issued by Trading Standards - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE4zV3VZWU1zUEszTWFuRkEyTWxUWUZ0QXdwYjd1RDR0MXZYa0dROGpQZktIODJzQ0dta2xzdi1VblNrd1BWVU1kX2ZKY3oxUWpSaHBPdzd5Ulg3Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE01YmdfaXgtdkk4RHFpMG42VzRRbFR2LVJ6VVF0T1pPV0VyWURJMlVWSnNBcFJLNlFIeGotVTdmZXkxazlnUnJmTkxiYTUya19NVmFWZEg3VUc0VWdEcXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Warning over 'unlicensed' nasal tanning sprays&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;William Higgens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Investigations, North West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Small bottles of nasal tanners.

Those who do may get a flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A small number of people infected with polio - between one in a thousand and one in a hundred - develop more serious problems that can lead to paralysis. This is also when the disease becomes life-threatening, particularly when paralysis affects muscles used for breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Papua New Guinea was said to be polio-free since 2000, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44614382" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;until an outbreak in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was contained within the same year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The latest cases were found to be carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia's easternmost Papua province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Minister Elias Kapavore has vowed to achieve 100% polio immunisation in the country by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no excuse... Polio is a serious disease," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below and is expected to reach around 3.5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The battle on polio starts today," the department wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef's Papua New Guinea representative Veera Mendonca pointed out the disparity in vaccination coverage across the country - with coverage as low as 8% in some districts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is not acceptable," she said, adding that Unicef is working with churches and community leaders to encourage vaccination and to dispel any misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years.

			&lt;p&gt;We're all aware of the psychological pain of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-s-loneliest-gannet-has-died-by-the-side-of-his-only-love"&gt;a broken heart&lt;/a&gt; – countless books, songs, and movies have been written and made on the topic – but there's also scientific evidence that a broken heart can be fatal too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical term is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt; (TC), a weakening of the heart brought on by physical or emotional stress. A new study from researchers at the University of Arizona looked at data on 199,890 patients in the US between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incidence of TC rose slightly over the study period for both males and females, but overall incidence was generally higher for females. Fatalities and complications caused by the condition were relatively high&lt;/span&gt;. This fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2015.10.022"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting this 'broken heart syndrome' is becoming more common in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the condition was more common in women, deaths were more than twice as likely in men, with 11.2 percent of males dying compared with 5.5 percent of females. The overall death rate was 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that the death rate from takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist M. Reza Movahed, from the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have put forward a hypothesis for the gap between men and women. TC is believed to be brought on by a surge of stress hormones, triggered by either physical or emotional stress – so a physical stress might be surgery or an infection, whereas emotional stress could be a divorce or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg" alt="Broken heart mortality rates" class="wp-image-161618 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mortality rates stayed high, but were higher for men. (Movahed et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical stress TC &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.11.027"&gt;is more common&lt;/a&gt; in men, which may explain the higher numbers of deaths brought on by the condition. The researchers also think differences in hormone balances between the sexes could play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications resulting from TC included congestive heart failure (35.9 percent of patients), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; (20.7 percent), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"&gt;cardiogenic shock&lt;/a&gt; (6.6 percent), stroke (5.3 percent) and cardiac arrest (3.4 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is often marked down as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or chest pain, because of the similarity of the symptoms. But the researchers behind the new study are hoping to raise awareness of the condition, so that it can be better diagnosed and treated more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is something that health professionals have known about for a while, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the condition – both in how it might be detected and how the risk of complications could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every case of TC is caused by relationship breakups, but it's clear that losing someone we love &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yes-you-can-die-from-a-broken-heart-new-study-shows-how-damaging-losing-a-loved-one-really-is"&gt;has multiple consequences&lt;/a&gt; for our physical and mental health, and that the heart can sometimes take the brunt of the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Adding these into your daily routine shouldn't be too expensive, but could help protect your brain for years to come if eaten together regularly alongside a healthy diet and lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the clip, &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; surgeon Dr Karan Rajan suggested that snacking on both blueberries and walnuts could help protect your brain. He said: "If you snack on blueberries and walnuts together, then the polyphenols from the blueberries combine with the omega-3s of the walnuts to become a brain protection powerhouse."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Both foods have a long-established link with better brain health and even reducing the risk of conditions such as dementia by slowing down cognitive decline and improving memory. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/high-intake-of-berries-apples-and-tea-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;A 2020 Harvard Health study&lt;/a&gt; found that berries, along with apples and certain types of tea, might help limit your risk of developing dementia as you get older. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Harvard experts attributed this finding to the level of flavonoids &lt;span&gt;in the superfoods. Flavonoids &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-thinking-on-flavonoids" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;are plant-based chemicals similar to polyphenols &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-thinking-on-flavonoids" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;found in most fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071526/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071526/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Walnuts are also praised as being helpful for those wanting to hold off dementia-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. These nuts are known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, improve cognitive function and potentially slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="instagram-content" data-mod="instagram" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="6"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad140675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease also showed that walnuts may have a beneficial effect in reducing the risk, delaying the onset, or slowing the progression, of Alzheimer's. Although no specific food can stop dementia, maintaining a nutritious and balanced diet can greatly lower your risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consuming a diet high in essential nutrients and low in unhealthy fats, sugars, and sodium can help manage blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and reduce the likelihood of diabetes, all of which are associated with a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These 'brain protection powerhouse' snacks don't have to be very expensive either. In Aldi, &lt;a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/product/everyday-essentials-blueberries-000000000000276894" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;you can get a 125g punnet of Wonky Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/product/the-pantry-walnut-pieces-000000000496633003" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;a 150g bag of Walnut Pieces&lt;/a&gt; both for £1.09. While generally safe for most people, these snacks might not be suitable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31651990" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating too many blueberries can cause digestive issues like diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting because of a high concentration of fibre. Blueberries may also lower blood sugar levels, potentially having an effect on medications used to manage diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walnuts contain oxalates, which can contribute to the formation of kidney stones if consumed in large quantities. And, walnuts are also high in 'healthy fats' that have a high calorie count, which might contribute to weight gain. Both foods could also be possible allergens, with walnuts being especially common. Reactions vary from person to person, either being fairly mild or could result in breathing difficulties or anaphylaxis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When introducing new foods to your diet, it is best to start slowly and include them in small doses to limit potential side effects. If you have specific health concerns or dietary restrictions, consult with your doctor for personalised medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can reduce your risk of dementia?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balanced diet:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on a variety of foods from the Eatwell Guide, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mediterranean diet:&lt;/b&gt; This diet, rich in seafood, fruits, and nuts, has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healthy fats:&lt;/b&gt; Include foods like fish (rich in omega-3 fatty acids), avocados, and nuts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carotenoids and antioxidants:&lt;/b&gt; These compounds can help protect against oxidative stress, which can damage cells and contribute to dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid processed foods:&lt;/b&gt; Limit or avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive red meat, as they can contribute to health problems linked to dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintain a healthy weight:&lt;/b&gt; Being overweight or obese can increase blood pressure and the risk of type 2 diabetes, both of which are linked to dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydration:&lt;/b&gt; Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regular eating habits:&lt;/b&gt; Establish regular meal and snack times.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other brain-boosing foods:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seafood:&lt;/b&gt; Especially fatty fish like salmon and tuna, which are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eggs:&lt;/b&gt; Weekly consumption of eggs has been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tea:&lt;/b&gt; People who drink tea, especially green tea, have a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nuts and seeds:&lt;/b&gt; These are good sources of healthy fats, antioxidants, and other nutrients.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fruits and vegetables:&lt;/b&gt; Provide antioxidants and other nutrients that can help protect brain health.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although diet is important, genetics and lifestyle choices also affect the risk of developing dementia. Diet cannot reverse or cure dementia. But a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet can significantly reduce your chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU29Xbk5RQXVKcTcwRWg2LVRmV1JDdFNoUW9WQUptSlFjQS0tamh5RjAwdDg5Y2lFM2ttRjFPRDVWR2JPNFdPd2dqQl9ua2JlSnoxcGg5VkRNbXpHS2hzME9RWWY1NkxpNEYzaXRHSEtJS3VuTVh0UzJObEFDNEdWbEptS1ROaVHSAYwBQVVfeXFMTTdaVTd4cE8yRVQtTXdKMlhMLWNZWDVtTnR6dGZsQTh4bTBFVTBEVmNxaHFpaFJEejRYQXhRTU0wV1RtRTMwbExmWXRxZ2xSMUtHMVJsajFoQlpIVDhwOWo2NVNLLXlTbW9DblAzYzNPcUVsV3RtRFI4ajRQYTNfdVZMRk5VS1pwLWhjVWs</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，您的步行方式可以带来惊人的健康益处- ScienceAlert | Your Walking Style Can Have Surprising Health Benefits, Study Says - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPT0QtVkw2WUllN01FNzh5blVpd3FlTW1TMjI5ejdmLW5tOHpObXdkLW53NnVyT2h1cUs2RHhCOHhBWllEdHZMRlFZaVZmWG1RZTEyZDJuSGJzYjljVm8zencwLWJLUFlTbTJ0Y1NEMlBmQ3EwMkZDTUg4RWR2QzBBcXdmc2FTcWl3NnEzRVVJYi1Bd1FTRWdFc0NB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, few things have inspired &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/online-wellness-content-3-ways-to-tell-evidence-based-health-information-from-pseudoscience-224119"&gt;as much quackery&lt;/a&gt; as the pills, potions and promises to slow ageing, boost vitality, or extend life. Yet, amid the hype and hollow claims, a few golden truths remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as 400 BC, Hippocrates, widely considered the father of modern medicine, famously said, "Walking is man's best medicine." More than two millennia later, science is finally catching up with that wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who walk more than 8,000 steps a day &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30211-4/fulltext"&gt;reduce their risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; by half, compared to those who walk fewer than 5,000 steps – the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. But beyond 8,000 steps, the benefits tend to plateau, which challenges the long-held belief in the magic of 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that benchmark wasn't born of science, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/counting-every-step-you-take"&gt;but of marketing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42864061"&gt;10,000-step goal&lt;/a&gt; originated from a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q598"&gt;1960s Japanese advertising campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the world's first commercial pedometer called the &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, which literally translates to "10,000 steps meter".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, researchers have been exploring a simple but important question: does every step count the same, or can walking faster – at a brisk pace of more than 100 steps a minute, or around three to four miles per hour – actually give you more health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ageing and heart health there is mounting evidence that pace really matters. Simply converting a 14-minute daily stroll into a seven-minute brisk walk has been associated with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae506"&gt;14% reduction in heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of more than 450,000 adults in the UK used a genetic marker of biological age to reveal that by middle age, a lifetime of brisk walking reduces biological age by up to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03323-x"&gt;16 years&lt;/a&gt; compared to a lifetime of slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study suggested it is never too late to benefit from brisk walking. An inactive 60-year woman or man was modelled to gain around an additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2024.100970"&gt;year of life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; through simply introducing a ten minute brisk walk into their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tYiLJ3rzkoU?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of brisk walking can also be seen in its ability to predict future health outcomes. It has been shown to be a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319887281"&gt;stronger predictor&lt;/a&gt; of the risk of dying from heart disease than traditional predictors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, while also being a more powerful predictor than many other measures of lifestyle – including diet, obesity levels, and total physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, perhaps the single most informative question a doctor could ask their patient is: "How fast is your walking pace in comparison to other people?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halo of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But brisk walking may not provide additional benefits for all outcomes or in all contexts. For example, the benefit of brisk walking over light-intensity walking in lowering  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggested that although total walking was associated with reduction in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;13 different types of cancers&lt;/a&gt;, there was no added value from brisk walking. Breaking prolonged sitting with light-intensity pottering around has also been shown to have profound impacts on metabolic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, walking has a halo of benefits beyond physical health. It can help with brain activity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036577"&gt;doubling creative idea production&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the systems in the brain that support memory and imagination are also the same as those activated during whole body movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us already harness this very phenomenon, using walking to mull over problems and arrive at solutions or insights that would otherwise remain elusive. Context is also important here, with the mental health and cognitive benefits of walking thought to be enhanced when walking through nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So called "nature prescriptions" for clinical populations have harnessed these principles to increase walking activity and improving both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h29z-l3XTlk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity is a major driver of the modern  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; of long-term conditions, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, that are now observed in industrialised and developing economies alike. It has been estimated that 3.9 million premature deaths could be averted annually through targeting physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of prevention, medical systems are largely based on management – people get ill and are then prescribed medicines to treat the illness. On average it takes $1 billion to bring a new drug to market which, despite these research and development costs, still go on to generate sizeable profits for shareholders showing the scale of the health economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If just a fraction of these costs were diverted into public health initiatives aimed at increasing walking and physical activity opportunities for all, the need for an ever more sophisticated medical management ecosphere may retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, when searching for the elixir of life, you could do worse than looking down at your feet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255655/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/thomas-e-yates-2383889"&gt;Thomas E.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Multnomah County public health officials have confirmed one case of tuberculosis at Southeast Portland's Lane Middle School. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had been recently diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis but may have been contagious between Sept. 3, 2024, and May 1, 2025, exposing others, officials said. Those who have been potentially exposed have been contacted by the Multnomah County Health Department via an emailed letter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County officials added that there is little risk to the general public at this time and they are not aware of any cases connected to the infectious person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland Public Schools said that the Lane Middle School community can join a &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com/xsi-nntk-hqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virtual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, also being held in-person at the middle school, at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, May 20, for more information about testing, as well as potential testing locations and times.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with &lt;a href="https://multco.us/news/faq-tuberculosis-exposure-and-steps-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;questions &lt;/a&gt;can call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406; the department will also be providing free blood tests to the school community in the coming weeks. Those doing a TB test with a personal health care provider should call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, most people who have had casual contact with a person diagnosed with tuberculosis will not become infected,” said Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno in a statement Thursday. “And most people who become infected will never become ill with tuberculosis, especially with current medication regimens. While tuberculosis can be spread in school settings, we expect that anyone infected would not yet be ill and could be effectively treated with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The county said it works with up to 30 tuberculous cases a year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tuberculous&lt;/a&gt;, a bacteria that spreads through close face-to-face contact for several hours or daily contact through weeks or months, is curable with medication, but the infection progresses slowly, so it is important to be treated in order to prevent serious illness. Tuberculous is not spread by sharing clothing, dishes or drinking glasses, and it does not live on surfaces and is not spread through contact like shaking hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include coughing, chest pain and coughing up blood or phlegm; people with inactive TB do not have symptoms and cannot spread it to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
