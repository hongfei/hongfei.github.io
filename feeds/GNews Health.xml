              &lt;p&gt;Dozens of restaurant goers in Wisconsin had the sort of meal you wouldn’t ever forget. A recent case report details how they were accidentally fed food made with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary ingredient in cannabis responsible for getting you high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local health officials described the sitcom-like shenanigans in a report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a2.htm"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Nearly 100 customers ate the restaurant’s THC-laced food in late October, some of whom visited the hospital as a result. The source of the “outbreak” was eventually traced back to THC-infused cooking oil mistaken for ordinary canola oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians and public health practitioners should be alert to the possibility of mass THC intoxication events via food,” the report authors, from Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the trouble (or fun, depending on your perspective) began sometime on October 22. Over the next three days, at least 85 people between the ages of 1 and 91 became intoxicated shortly after eating at the restaurant, including seven people who were sent to a local hospital with symptoms like dizziness, sleepiness, and anxiety. One individual was advised to call Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County; the person reported they had tested positive for THC without any known exposure and that they had eaten at the restaurant the day before, prompting further investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 24, officials contacted the restaurant’s owner, who agreed to immediately shut the place down. That same day, the owner called back and reported that the restaurant was in a building with a cooperative (shared) kitchen used by another business that produced THC edibles derived from hemp. The owner also reported that on October 22, the restaurant ran out of its cooking oil and began using oil from the shared kitchen—which the owner assumed was simply canola oil—to make the dough for its pizzas, sandwiches, and other bread-filled goods. A large oil container in the same area where the borrowed oil was found was then tested and found positive for THC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials brought in the local police for help, who determined that the restaurant’s THC contamination was indeed an accident, and no criminal charges were filed against the owner or others. It also appears no one was seriously hurt as a result. After a thorough cleaning, the restaurant opened back up on October 26.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As funny as all this sounds, anyone who’s mistakenly bitten into an edible or knows someone who has (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) can attest that it isn’t always a picnic to deal with, even if the effects are ultimately temporary. The victims also included eight children, three who experienced vomiting and one who even developed hallucinations. Thankfully, none of them were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say more should be done to prevent these sorts of incidents, given the rising popularity of THC and cannabis-centered businesses, especially if the businesses share space with restaurants. “Regulations regarding practices such as standard, clear labeling and locked storage for ingredients containing THC, might decrease the risk for unintentional THC exposure at licensed food businesses,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just wondering if the incident lowered or boosted the restaurant’s Yelp rating.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While laws around surrogates, or “gestational carriers”, vary around the world, the practice is booming. According to Global Market Insights, the market is expected to grow from $27.9bn (£20.8bn) in 2025 to $201.8bn (£150.2bn) in 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings underscore the importance of adequate screening and counselling of potential gestational carriers before pregnancy about the possibility of a new-onset mental illness, or exacerbation of a prior mental illness during or after pregnancy,” said Dr Maria Velez, the first author of the research, from McGill University in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. “As well, the provision of support during and after pregnancy may be particularly important for gestational carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.23428" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jama Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, Velez and colleagues report how they analysed data from 767,406 births in Ontario that occurred between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of these, 748,732 involved unassisted conceptions, 758 involved surrogacy, and the others involved &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ivf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;IVF&lt;/a&gt; in mothers who carried their own babies. Velez said the vast majority of surrogacy cases in Canada involved the surrogate being unrelated to the child, meaning the surrogate’s eggs were not used in conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those excluded from this initial analysis were women with a record of mental illness prior to the estimated date of conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team analysed the number of women in each group who received a diagnosis of a new-onset mental illness since the estimated date of conception, such as anxiety disorder, mood disorder, self-harm or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These diagnoses occurred in 236 surrogates, 195,022 women who had an unassisted conception and 4,704 women who had received IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for factors such as age, income, smoking and number of children, this corresponded to a 43% and 29% higher incidence rate of new mental illness per 100 people per year of follow-up in surrogates compared with women who had an unassisted conception or IVF, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For all three groups, mood or anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis, while median time from conception to diagnosis was similar, at about two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found the risk of new mental illness remained elevated in surrogates, but to a lesser degree, when compared with women who had an unassisted conception but no longer lived with their child a year after the birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The finding might suggest that some gestational carriers may experience grief from relinquishing their newborn, like that described after adoption or removal of the child into foster care – something that needs further studies,” said Velez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team then carried out further analyses that included women with a previous record of mental illness and found all groups in this category had a higher rate of new-onset mental illness than those with no previous record. Despite Canada requiring would-be surrogates to undergo psychological assessments, the results revealed 19% of surrogates in the study had a documented diagnosis of mental illness before pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study follows &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/23/surrogates-face-higher-risk-of-pregnancy-complications-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; by the team that found surrogates were more likely to experience complications including severe postpartum haemorrhage and severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Zaina Mahmoud, an expert on the socio-legal aspects of surrogacy at the University of Liverpool, in England, who was not involved in the work, said further research was needed to explore whether the greater risk of new mental illness in surrogates was down to the pregnancy itself, and the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The researchers are] not addressing why or how surrogates have these emotional trajectories,” she said, adding that the team had used very broad definitions of mental illness. “They hypothesise that grief from relinquishing the infant may contribute, but they don’t actually measure that grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Mahmoud backed the call for greater screening and support for potential surrogates, saying the work suggested support should last for more than two years after the birth. The studies “really highlight the need for robust information and consent procedures”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOMjBoZDRjTkllRVhSWkN5TVZLTWJTanhza2xBLVpCTGd1dnZFRG13dVpKMG95dnVYVlhPemt1YUFReXR3WE1sVUhTNGJjMXBwZVZscko2dzczNVJtQ0dfeTRFd0k2ZmZYX0lDZW1VYkVuS2J4dzlxWktuM0QwWmtfSWJSZnR1d2xlcVRmSHlhSlJtd1R2YVJwbnIzeVMtaDVxOHZYTi1CWmNUaUotUFRZaWpneWFCX0h5OVpuN1lB</guid></item><item><title>医生发明了家庭测试，用于影响数百万美国人的病情，但长达10年未被诊断-每日邮报 | Doctors invent at-home test for condition that affects millions of Americans but goes undiagnosed for up to 10 YEARS - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A first-of-its-kind at-home test can reveal whether a person suffers from endometriosis, a condition that leaves patients suffering from debilitating pain and without a diagnosis for up to a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endometriosis is a condition that causes tissue similar to the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, to grow outside the uterus. It affects at least 11 percent of American women, more than 6.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tissue thickens and breaks down, but because it grows outside the uterus, there is no way for it to the leave body like typical lining does in blood during menstruation. It becomes trapped and leads to the formation of cysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often causes damage to the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis and can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14515811/doctor-relieve-debilitating-symptoms-common-conditition-women-endometriosis.html"&gt;cause extreme menstrual pain&lt;/a&gt;, pain during sex, excessive bleeding, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fertility/index.html" id="mol-ba874db0-68c9-11f0-80c7-7b44e4cbf215"&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt; problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, it takes about a decade for doctors to diagnose endometriosis because of misdiagnosis, stigma and lack of access to proper healthcare - which can leave many women in excruciating pain for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, doctors conduct a laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis, which involves inserting a small camera in the body to find the extra tissue near the pelvis, taking a sample and testing it for confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a diagnosis is made, potential treatments include birth control pills to stop the menstrual cycle or hormonal medication. As of now, there is no long-term treatment or cure for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers at the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-ba907570-68c9-11f0-80c7-7b44e4cbf215"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; State University have now developed a new minimally invasive test patients can do themselves that can detect a biomarker for the disease in period blood and get a diagnosis - and start treatment - years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A first-of-its-kind pregnancy-like at-home test can reveal whether you suffer from endometriosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Developed by Dr Dipanjan Pan, a Dorothy Foehr Huck &amp;amp; J. Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine at the university, and his team, the at-home test offers up a diagnosis with nearly five times more accuracy than a laparoscopy in just 10 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan explained to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/endometriosis-home-test-diagnosis-period-blood-2102953"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'This is the first time we have a proof of principle pregnancy-like test that shows one can collect menstrual blood and run it in the privacy of home and obtain the results in 10 minutes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted that menstrual blood and tissue that is shed from the uterus each month is often overlooked as medical waste but could help with earlier and more accessible endometriosis detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Dipanjan Pan, a Dorothy Foehr Huck &amp;amp; J.

The team is actively looking for funding and partners to further develop the test. With funding, this timeline can be reduced in my opinion.

For half of them, a second scan took place between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used machine learning models built from 15,334 pre-pandemic scans to estimate each volunteer’s brain age gap, the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age. A positive gap means the brain appears older on imaging, a negative gap younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was that even people who hadn’t had Covid showed significant increases in brain aging rates,” said Mohammadi-Nejad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who weren’t infected but lived through the pandemic showed an average increase in brain age of about five and a half months compared to similar individuals who were scanned twice before 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age, male sex, and lower income made the acceleration steeper, demonstrating that biology and biography travel together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-accelerates-brain-aging"&gt;Stress accelerates brain aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds to a growing collection of research that links chronic stress hormones to faster structural decline in white matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated allostatic load, the body’s cumulative stress score, correlates with brains that look a year or two older than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation compounds the problem. A study of 24,867 adults found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-harms-health-more-than-alcohol-obesity-or-smoking/"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and poverty were linked to higher brain age and worse physical health. Lockdowns amplified both stress and isolation, so a slight pandemic era uptick in brain age is biologically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support the idea. Rodents under constant stress show brain inflammation and damage in areas used to estimate brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infected-brains-show-more-decline"&gt;Infected brains show more decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 infection had its own costs. Participants who caught the virus took longer on the Trail Making Test (TMT), a timed task of mental flexibility, than both controls and pandemic peers who were never infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Japanese cohort &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563673/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; confirms that slower trail making times flag early cognitive change in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans of infected people elsewhere echo the pattern. A 2022 report comparing 401 infected volunteers with 384 controls found greater gray matter loss in orbitofrontal and parahippocampal regions, areas tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-your-brain-decides-what-smells-good-or-bad/"&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Nottingham analysis, only the infected subgroup linked larger brain age jumps with worse trail making scores, hinting that viral effects and stress effects overlap but are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-hits-the-vulnerable-harder"&gt;Stress hits the vulnerable harder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood, working an unstable job, or lacking higher education magnified the brain aging-signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment insecurity, for example, added almost six extra months to the gap compared with securely employed peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scans make visible a truth social scientists have charted for decades: financial strain and limited social capital seep into physiology. When economic cushions thinned during &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-19-lockdowns-weakened-our-immune-systems/"&gt;lockdowns&lt;/a&gt;, the impact may have sped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data support protecting vulnerable groups during crises, as stress leaves measurable effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-healing-depends-on-lifestyle"&gt;Healing depends on lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it’s certainly possible, and that’s an encouraging thought,” said Professor Dorothee Auer, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain age models capture averages, not destinies. Earlier studies of stress recovery suggest that gray matter volume and brain connectivity can rebound when stress is reduced. Recovery is more likely when lifestyle factors like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and social contact improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer follow-ups will reveal whether the pandemic’s neural footprint fades, stays put, or predicts later cognitive trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the scans remind us that global emergencies do not end at the ICU door – they echo inside healthy brains, too, in ways only careful imaging can catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-scans-reveal-policy-impact"&gt;Brain scans reveal policy impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds weight to the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brains-age-might-be-older-than-you-are/"&gt;brain age&lt;/a&gt; could become a routine marker in population health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If small changes in daily life – or major global events – show up clearly on brain scans, public health leaders might one day use brain age metrics to evaluate policy impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also raises the question of how resilience works at a neural level. Some people weathered the pandemic with little psychological or neurological wear, while others showed sharper declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what protects brain health under chronic stress could shape future treatments or community interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:11:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQYV91QWpBX1BTRGV1LUY0NWJuZ2s1QjB1Nzg5Y051WmRKeXh0Qm1ZY0lQVXRHc3dsWFNUWVI3dEw4VW5qSG9tNDcwM0FRSUJaaXNoNXM1dXB4cWJPLW1oSmRhWE5DV0FteDVYZkZMM0JtVFlKNW9YMXJWNkt2bkNzcnZYWlh0dHdFZnd6OTlZRUtFT0xiV1E</guid></item><item><title>直接来自医疗专业人士的13种严重危害您健康的“坏”日常习惯- BuzzFeed | 13 "Bad" Everyday Habits That Are Seriously Harming Your Health, Straight From Medical Professionals - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9BSFktSm1rbkwyUXR3OHVnbktQT0xiMEtuR1c4MU1CSVVMR1VrY3hvV182LWFZblZBbmdxNURIVUFMbXAwTDZyZ0J6T0lCWm16TUhwMU5iUW1NMnNIUzFtWHItcDVhNnlieW5QYTV2SmNGLU0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

A study by researchers from Columbia University and Rutgers University—published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024—reveals some eye-opening findings about bottled water. This report challenges the idea that bottled water is a safer pick over tap water and makes us wonder about its effects on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unveiling the presence of microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found an average of 240,000 plastic fragments per liter in bottled water. Most of these particles are actually nanoplastics, with 90% measuring less than 1 micrometer; the other 10% fall into the microplastics range, between 5 millimeters and 1 micrometer. Given that such tiny pieces can slip into the bloodstream and possibly settle in organs like the heart and brain, the findings are quite concerning. Wei Min, a Columbia chemistry professor and co-author, noted, “The smaller they are, the easier it is to confuse them with natural cell components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nail down these results, the team used advanced techniques like stimulated Raman scattering microscopy paired with artificial intelligence. This method helped them pinpoint and sort seven different types of plastics in bottled water, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Beizhan Yan, a research professor at Columbia, mentioned that if a bottle has lots of PET bits, there tend to be fewer particles from other plastics used in water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sources and implications of contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study points to several origins for the plastic particles in bottled water. PET, a common material for making bottles, came up as a major source. But it wasn’t just the bottle itself—filtration and purification systems also seem to add plastic bits. This means that even thorough cleaning processes might accidentally introduce these small plastic bits into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, among all the brands tested, only one showed no sign of microplastics or nanoplastics. Although the study didn’t name the brand, it shows that making bottled water free from these tiny plastics is possible if strict filtration and packaging methods are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings make anyone who drinks bottled water every day rethink their options and wonder about the quality of what they’re consuming. They also point to the need for more studies on plastic contamination from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind this groundbreaking work isn’t stopping here. They plan to widen their research to tap water, packaged foods, and even human tissues to see just how widespread plastic particles really are. They’re also set to study how these particles affect development and the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan called this area “a dark, unexplored field,” noting that earlier toxicity tests were mostly guesses about plastic exposure levels. Now, with these new methods, there’s a chance to really understand how deeply microplastics have crept into our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to grips with these revelations about microplastics in bottled water, it’s clear that we need to reconsider our choices and push for better standards in how water is filtered and bottled. This study is a wake-up call, urging us all to look closer at what we’re drinking and to start moving toward cleaner alternatives that put our well-being first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Health officials in Chicago issued a similar warning a few weeks earlier, as a batch of mosquitoes there had tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With mosquito season underway in Illinois, it is now time for Illinoisans, especially seniors and those with weakened immune systems, to start taking precautions to prevent mosquito bites," said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra, according to Patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this announcement important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;West Nile can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the virus can also be deadly. Illinois saw 69 human cases in 2024, including 13 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://idph.illinois.gov/wnvpublic/wnvglance.aspx?year=2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:IDPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;IDPH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While West Nile has been in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007186.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1999;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, a warming planet is driving increases in mosquito-borne illnesses. These bloodsuckers benefit from warmer and wetter conditions, which are helping them expand their ranges, remain active for longer seasons, and move into higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, a Massachusetts epidemiologist recently called people to alert after the state discovered its first West Nile-carrying mosquitoes two weeks earlier than last year. And Connecticut officials are warning residents that the type of tiger mosquito that carries chikungunya, Zika, and dengue is expected to spread farther and faster than usual across the state in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne illnesses?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The IDPH is encouraging people to "fight the bite" to best avoid the potential of contracting West Nile. Recommendations include eliminating standing water, using screens on windows or doors or keeping them shut, wearing long clothing and an Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent when outside, and reporting standing water if it has been present for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many communities are also looking for ways to reduce mosquito populations in their efforts to protect residents. For instance, officials in one Florida county are using X-rays to kill invasive mosquitoes, and one Manila neighborhood is paying residents to bring in any mosquitoes they can capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec3K1DcanxmvsGYh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTU90RzlTUmlSR2xmaTVLVXR2UVlqOTB0eTZ6SlV6Y3dqekhhZ3lRcjl0aGwzZTk0LWhSclI5MkFRN1dtVVFWbEczaUhrTXpLclJzTW9hZG90QW1abzNyaG9uVWU4RXVBU2xmaGpOcklIejlxcEZtZHpsME9VUlcyWS1DTGtaUUN4X2VQX1JpMEQ</guid></item><item><title>这8个常见习惯可能会增加您患痴呆症的风险- HuffPost | These 8 Common Habits Could Increase Your Risk Of Dementia - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOV1hlQzlKUnNTeHNzc0RnV2RhMU5ON1NXdUdkS2lvekV2UHpITGEtSi1SOWFTUkplVlFrN2lqdVI4WFZQdXpvS2VBZHNzemRtZjRSUjZpaXUxcW9fNmJ5TXF5QXdvdDNabnNXMFUxM28zd0ktc0xYUnZhUU1vdllvaDB5c3REOWlDelFnM2JMMzXSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0hWejhCQWE5cGhGdlBVc0paWE00aUFQUjZEMTdBaTVzaDJicTlOWUxyU09zWWt6bEZKX3ZkMkEwb09SMVB4MlE5N1BuNWxGN0ZXU3huRTFZRi1GNDFGYUstWkRpUkNhakJKV21sWkJPSmNEUkF2RFlDbV9mSXBqbzVySWlfZGN5QTdSNHoxVmpieHpaNEtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As folks grow older, many health fears come to mind. But one in particular tends to really worry folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most consuming fears of older adults [is] that they might lose their memory and become a burden to others,” said &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/e/ellison-james" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. James Ellison" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/e/ellison-james" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. James Ellison&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatric psychiatrist at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific type of memory loss that’s a top fear for many older adults is known as dementia, which is an umbrella term that refers to conditions that cause “mental loss, cognitive loss that’s severe enough to affect daily function,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/victor-henderson" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Victor Henderson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.stanford.edu/victor-henderson" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Victor Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the NIH Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia may make someone forget their address, not remember why they’re running a certain errand or no longer be able to pay bills they always pay.

The caveat is that most of these haven’t been studied, at least adequately studied, in randomized clinical trials,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, following the guidance below isn’t going to totally prevent a dementia diagnosis, but these are habits that also benefit your health as a whole. So, there’s no reason not to follow them, whether they are good for lowering your dementia risk, chance of a heart attack or bettering your mood.

A plant-based diet is also a good one to follow for brain health, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not managing other health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t shy away from managing your medical conditions, Prather said. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol are dementia risk factors, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Really aggressively managing those risk factors is well established to be a way of reducing the risk of cognitive health dementia in the future,” Prather said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for vascular risk factors like atrial fibrillation or high blood pressure or hyperlipidemia,” Ellison added. Doing so protects circulation, blood supply and oxygen supply to the brain, Ellison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important for the prevention of vascular dementia in particular, which happens &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when blood flow" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;when blood flow&lt;/a&gt; is blocked to the brain. Vascular dementia is a common kind of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not getting enough restorative sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to sleep adequately because the brain renews itself during deep sleep and lowers its concentration of beta amyloid, which is the toxic protein that contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prather added that you should also be sure to treat any sleep disorders that are interfering with your rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an epidemic of undiagnosed sleep apnea in older adults,” Prather said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sleep apnea results in poor-quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep can also be impacted by the use of medications that induce sleep, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are all signs your body is not getting the restorative sleep that it needs to consolidate memories and to have the most optimal cognitive function going forward,” said Prather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not making time for friends and family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prioritize social connections, said Prather. “We know that loneliness and depression and isolation are exceptionally negative for health,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have impacts on cognition as well as mortality,” said Prather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is an epidemic among older adults, and has a mortality associated with it [that’s] similar to &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="moderate smoking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;moderate smoking&lt;/a&gt;,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your mind socially engaged is also an important way to stay cognitively engaged, Prather said, whether that’s by taking part in conversations or listening to stories from loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of recent research has found that alcohol is not good for your health.

Just like our body as a whole, the liver is aging and can’t handle alcohol the same way it could when you were 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other piece about alcohol is not only that, it’s a direct toxin (we increasingly know it increases risk for almost all cancers), but it can really disrupt sleep,” Prather said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you have a drink before bed, notice how it impacts your sleep, she suggested. And, as mentioned above, it’s important to get restorative sleep to reduce your dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 65, it’s recommended that folks have no more than one standard drink a day and no more than seven in a week, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The CDC recommends" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than two drinks each day for men and no more than one for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Halfpoint Images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint Images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Head injuries are associated with a higher dementia risk, which makes it important to wear a helmet when getting on your bike.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skipping out on exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ellison, it’s important to both live a generally active lifestyle and get in aerobic and other forms of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean walking to do your errands instead of driving while also making plans to go to a workout class or go for a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s recommended that older adults exercise 30 minutes aerobically, five days a week, but only about 10% of those over 75 meet that level of activity,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good for your cardiovascular health, which, as mentioned above, is also good for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prather added that fitness is something you should be prioritizing no matter your age and, “well before any cognitive changes happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Not wearing a helmet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things I tell my patients is, if you’re bicycling, wear a helmet,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been a huge number of observational studies linking head injury to dementia,” Henderson added. There is a consistent association that head injuries likely do play a role in dementia risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How large of a role does it play in someone’s dementia risk? “The answer might be that it doesn’t play a huge role at a population level, but on an individual level, it’s probably really important,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.

But it’s increasing in part because the number of people living to a very old age is increasing,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dementia happens in older folks, Henderson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, on the bright side, “if you look at the actual chance of getting dementia at a particular age, it’s actually come down slightly, not a whole lot, but slightly, and it seems to parallel advances in taking care of cardiovascular health,” Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also now disease-modifying FDA-approved medications for the most common form of dementia, which is Alzheimer’s, said Ellison, who stressed that it’s important to start these medications early on in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it important to talk to your doctor if you do notice that you have cognitive challenges such as &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="frequently misplacing items" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;frequently misplacing items&lt;/a&gt;, memory changes that disturb your life or have trouble solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The tumour initially grew slowly, but in late 2022, it began to increase in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still under 30mm, it qualified for stereotactic radiotherapy — a targeted form of radiation that minimises damage to surrounding brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April said: 'When they said I had a brain tumour, my first thought was that I was going to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;April Tate, 52, from Burntisland in Fife, first became concerned in 2018 when she forgot a child's name while working as a childminder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;April is pictured here with her radiotherapy mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a numbing moment. I was a single mum, and my daughter Abby was still a teenager. All I could think about was not being there for her.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being self-employed meant taking time off for treatment brought financial pressure too, which just added to the stress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'When the surgeon explained the tumour was located in a really difficult part of my brain and he'd only attempted surgery in that area once before, it was hard to accept.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, April was placed on a programme of regular scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It was terrifying to live with the unknown of whether it would grow or not. Over time, I began to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The tumour was slow-growing, and for a while, it didn't change much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in late 2022, the tumour had grown. It was still under 30mm, meaning April qualified for stereotactic radiotherapy. The treatment, though precise, took its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The radiotherapy itself was fairly quick each day, but it was exhausting,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with a posterior falcine meningioma—a low-grade tumour in a location too dangerous for surgery. April's brain scan is pictured above, the tumour showing in white&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The team had to make a custom mask to keep my head completely still, which felt claustrophobic and intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just closed my eyes, listened to music and tried to stay calm. The hardest part came afterwards, with having to wait to find out if it had worked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To her relief, the tumour had shrunk. Follow-up scans have shown further reduction, and April now has annual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since returned to work and even completed her first 5k run earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumour, accounting for around a third of all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They form in the meninges—the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord—and are usually slow-growing and benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, their location can make them dangerous. A posterior falcine meningioma develops near the falx cerebri, a narrow fold of tissue between the two hemispheres of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tumours in this region are deep-seated and often close to critical structures, such as major blood vessels, making surgery extremely risky or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumour, accounting for around a third of all cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Determined to make a difference, April is taking on the 88 Squats a Day in July challenge, supporting Brain Tumour Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms depend on the tumour's size and location but can include headaches, vision problems, memory loss, or changes in behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients, like April, initially dismiss early warning signs as stress, ageing, or hormonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, or 'watch and wait' monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as active surveillance, this approach is often used for slow-growing brain tumours that aren’t causing serious symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than rushing into surgery or radiotherapy, doctors monitor the tumour with regular MRI scans—typically every six to 12 months—to track its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This strategy is considered safe when the tumour is low-grade (non-cancerous), small in size, and not located near areas of the brain that control critical functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps avoid the risks of invasive treatment unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the psychological toll can be significant. Patients live with the knowledge that the tumour is still there, and if it starts to grow or cause problems, they may need treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April’s case, her tumour’s position meant surgery was ruled out — but she was able to undergo stereotactic radiotherapy, a targeted form of treatment that can shrink tumours while sparing surrounding healthy brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to make a difference, April is taking on the 88 Squats a Day in July challenge, supporting Brain Tumour Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/April1749638978570"&gt; challenge&lt;/a&gt; aims to raise £2,740—the amount needed to fund a single day of research ​at the Scottish Brain Tumour​ ​Research Centre of Excellence, in​ collaboration with Beatson Cancer Charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is raising the cash via the website &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/April1749638978570"&gt;JustGiving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April said: 'People hear the words "benign" or "low-grade" and assume it's nothing serious, but I still live with this every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's something in my brain that shouldn't be there, and it could change at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I even worried about how it might affect new relationships and not wanting to burden someone else with what I was going through. But we still deserve to live fully, and to love and be loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What shocks me most is how little funding goes into researching brain tumours.

states that STI cases tend to peak during the summer, which is commonly attributed to increased social activity, travel and sexual behavior during warmer months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this trend, Ivigor Medical &lt;a href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that broader patterns that shape the spread of sexually transmitted infections include disparities in access to healthcare, varying levels of sexual health education, differences in testing and screening practices and persistent social and economic inequities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2024-11/2023-EPI-State-Profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;2023 report&lt;/a&gt;

                Xerius Jackson, age 7, gets an MMR vaccine at a clinic in Lubbock, Texas, on March 1, two months into a multistate outbreak of measles that began in January. During this time, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to how the federal government assesses vaccine recommendations.

   &lt;p&gt;For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/olanrewaju-omolayo-falusi/2359516" target="_blank"&gt;Lanre Falusi&lt;/a&gt; has counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, I'm having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines," Falusi said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Throughout the U.S., pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's especially true for those with children covered by Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary," said &lt;a href="https://palmettopediatric.com/downtown-office.php" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory body&lt;/a&gt; in June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out of pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation's adult and childhood immunization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views, prompting alarm among medical professionals and public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Insurance uncertainty worries parents&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People should be worried about what's going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children," said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;required to cover&lt;/a&gt; all ACIP-recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;ACIP's recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC Program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose: pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;health insurance industry group AHIP&lt;/a&gt; said that health plans "continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians say news about President Trump's new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, has also prompted questions from parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn't mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children's Medicaid, Tolbert said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates," Tolbert said. "It's unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May, Kennedy announced in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC is no longer recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The move &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prompted a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy's directive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-is-thimerosal-what-the-research-says-about-the-vaccine-preservative-under-fire-by-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;rallied against thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; for decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There is no cause for concern," Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. "As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free," Hilliard wrote. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Falusi's practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child's eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Doctors warn that fewer kids may get shots if cost shifts to families&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Melissa Mason&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, N.M., has treated some patients who got measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. "We're seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community," Mason said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last year, overall kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates fell&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading. &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182774" target="_blank"&gt;As of July 5&lt;/a&gt;, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Columbia, S.C., Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not saying that anymore," the pediatrician said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/what-i-tell-every-patient-about-the-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;prevent cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot," Greenhouse said. "I had to tell them it's not allowed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out of pocket, she's afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could cost &lt;a href="https://www.gardasil9.com/patient-a/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;about $300&lt;/a&gt; if no longer covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines," Greenhouse said. "I can tell you it's a very scary place to be."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meeting&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            
&lt;p&gt;European regulators have greenlit a twice-yearly injection to prevent HIV that has been hailed as a game-changer in the course of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jab from the drugmaker Gilead was considered one of the biggest medical breakthroughs of 2024, offering an alternative to daily pills. &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/07/24/stunning-study-shows-twice-a-year-jab-could-offer-100-protection-against-hiv-infection"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The drug, called lenacapavir,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was 100 per cent effective at preventing the virus in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;It is a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which works by preventing the virus from replicating and spreading within the body. It reduces the risk of acquiring HIV among both adults and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) advisory committee issued a positive opinion of the drug on Friday, clearing the way for the European Commission to approve the drug in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This milestone reflects our commitment to reimagine HIV prevention in Europe and around the world,” Dr Dietmar Berger, Gilead Sciences’ chief medical officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lenacapavir for PrEP has the potential to become a critical tool for public health, helping to expand prevention options for people who face the highest barriers to care”.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;While there has been progress in the fight against HIV, cases have been rising. In 2023, there were more than 24,700 &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/11/28/number-of-europeans-diagnosed-with-hiv-rose-in-2023-with-new-cases-in-most-countries"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new HIV diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, up 11.8 per cent from 2022.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"PrEP is a cornerstone of HIV-control efforts in Europe and worldwide and is very effective at preventing infections if taken as prescribed," the EMA &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-injection-easier-prevention-hiv-infection-eu-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, uptake and adherence are often suboptimal because access to some medicines is limited, and other available medicines require strict daily intake".&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;That's why health experts believe that having a twice-yearly injection available could boost efforts to control HIV, which affects about &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;40.8 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. An estimated 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved the new drug last month. In the EU, Gilead expects to sell it under the name Yeytuo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilead has &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/10/millions-will-die-in-coming-years-if-us-funding-for-hiv-programmes-is-not-replaced-un-warn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agreed to sell generic versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the drug in 120 lower-income countries with high HIV rates. But it is not yet clear how widely available it will be after the United States, which has traditionally been a major global health donor, slashed funding earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated July 25:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a comment from the European Medicines Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

County Department of Public Health officials are investigating two sites in Los Angeles the man visited while infectious, according to a news release. Public spaces where others may have been exposed to the infection are LAX and the Hilton Los Angeles Airport, at 5711 W. Century Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person landed July 5 at LAX; the exact time and flight information were still being investigated, according to the department. The infected individual was at the Hilton from 7:30 p.m. July 5 until checking out at 1 p.m. July 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who were at these locations on these days are urged by the department to monitor potential symptoms for at least three weeks. Symptoms include high fever, coughs, or red, watery eyes, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also urged to confirm their MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination status. Those who have not been immunized are at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As The Times reported last month, the U.S. is in the midst of its &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/more-measles-cases-in-california-this-year-than-reported-in-all-of-2024-data-show"&gt;largest outbreak of measles in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with California already reporting more cases of the disease than in all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As outbreaks ramp up within the U.S. and internationally, the release said, summer travel can heighten exposure and transmission levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can linger in the air and on surfaces, making it easy to spread, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer. “A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department encouraged all residents to review their immunization records, contact their healthcare provider about potential exposure — especially if they are pregnant or have a weakened immune system — and avoid large gatherings if symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said, however, that the most effective preventive measure against measles is immunization. “The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 03:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUEh5SXlrMDM2MVJlb2czaEczY3Z0cnpMb2xHVm5oWlBZV0c5dnVLVnpkZU0xZk1IaDFjUDN0NVZoM0RBcVNRd3FUZlhxcmhiX0R5RURlNmREMkduaGwtLVp1RFhpbEoxOWZCTnl2Z2sxU1hkc1Q2VHc3amxuNTgtaEU0MkpUWEJ5T2xUMTZjWUxfRDJjYWVDbmZSZUhPeTQ0cDh5Wm9DbnJ1T2ZsbmJXWVRXSjhtT185</guid></item><item><title>随着密歇根州药物过量死亡人数下降，这些差异仍然存在-底特律新闻 | As drug overdose deaths decline in Michigan, these disparities persist - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPRmdXcmVJS2FYM2JwZlNnVFozWXhNaDlJT05nSkxWNV9ZSktYYW1EcmZYVHQxX2J2bGNzMnNHcFhDYlQ1MUZGUGtsSkk2VEdzUzlqNWpiejVDdkMtal9vMlJDdFBnVDNhbXV1eHg1Zm1NTWhSclJKRmJUNUtrbDl3X0ZFS3VUbmNGTExSQXFoMkdRS05fNTUwbGFwWl9ZYlJDcmJrLW1sYWdBLXdUdzJVSy0xLWttY3NRMWlYUFpCMVVtanYyV3VCOVNIWExJWkQzSUdBMWhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="relative pb-5 w-full font-sans text-primary bg-inherit" data-testid="footer"&gt;&lt;p class="relative w-[1200px] max-w-[90vw] border-t border-button-disabled mx-auto mb-[30px]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="flex flex-col gap-5 items-center max-w-[1200px] px-5 mx-auto md:px-10 lg:px-[50px]"&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center items-center w-full text-sm" data-testid="copyright"&gt;&lt;span&gt;© 2025 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper.

I have had so many, usually related to diabetics with foot sores- almost always resulting in amputation of a toe (or more).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, my favorite was an elderly farmer who came in with chest pain that, 'Wouldn't go away', as he put it. When we asked him if he had it before had it before- he had said that he had been having chest pain on and off for years, but it would typically go away after he grabbed his electric fence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, the first time he had the pain- he was standing out near an electric fence on his farm, and he reached out to steady himself and accidentally grabbed the electric fence, which shocked him, and made the pain go away. So after that, whenever he would have the pain, he just went and grabbed the fence and it made him feel better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had literally been cardioverting himself for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was fixed up and sent on his way- but we all still chuckle about it now and then because he was so nonchalant about it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4edn5/" target="_blank"&gt; FlaviusArrianus &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/shallow-focus-photography-of-barb-wire-0vKqq-_6wto" target="_blank"&gt; Marivi Pazos / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065588"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065588" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-19-68821f487ddfc__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman lying in bed alone, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking consequences and serious health risks." title="Elderly woman lying in bed alone, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking consequences and serious health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’m still just a nursing student, but my professor told us a story of when he was an ER nurse. An elderly 80 something year old woman came in to the ER, and as he assessed her, he noticed her oral temperature was normal despite her neck being extremely hot to the touch. He decided to take a rectal temperature, which ended up being like 103 or something crazy. While he was down there, he noticed something peeking out of her v****a and proceeded to remove it. It was an old sock. She said her uterus had prolapsed months before and she was using the sock to keep it in. They began treating her for TSS immediately but sadly she went septic and died later that day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tongue in cheek, he told us she died of toxic sock syndrome. 😩💀 nurses have to use dark humor to cope.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4roe9/" target="_blank"&gt; pinkawapuhi &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/elderly-caucasian-woman-sleeping-on-the-bed-D5kfGQYAvj8" target="_blank"&gt; Curated Lifestyle / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-81/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065508"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065508" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-2-6881fd5fcbcb4__700.jpg" alt="Female doctor examining an X-ray, highlighting the consequences of patients delaying medical help and treatment." title="Female doctor examining an X-ray, highlighting the consequences of patients delaying medical help and treatment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A&amp;amp;E/ED doctor here! &lt;br&gt;A farmer in his 70s reluctantly came in with his wife after falling over outside while wrangling a sheep one WEEK earlier.

He wound up tearing some stitches that were placed and bleeding like a stuck hog all weekend long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Came into our clinic, blue in the lips and fingers, and her hemoglobin was 4 (normal should be 12 - 15). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She didn't wanna be a bother, so she waited until she started feeling dizzy all the time. She got another trip to the hospital for transfusion and repair for that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But...like I said, this isn't the first time I've seen that, so for the love of God...if homeboy is begging for it after you just had a baby, maybe he needs a lesson in self control and a bottle of moisturizer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ksod/" target="_blank"&gt; Ssutuanjoe &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/topless-woman-lying-on-bed-tcrWppXr2Xk" target="_blank"&gt; Greg Pappas / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065532"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065532" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-11-6882022487013__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a patient’s knee being bandaged, highlighting delayed help with shocking consequences in medical care." title="Close-up of a patient’s knee being bandaged, highlighting delayed help with shocking consequences in medical care."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Former medic here.

Never saw a doctor about it- They just borrowed a friends wheelchair and kept it rolling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turned out he’d had multiple strokes with multiple risk factors he never addressed.

When we came down, we saw that the patient was holding a plastic bag over their abdomen. When this was removed, we found that their wound had opened and their intestine was visible to the air. It transpired that this was not something that had happened over night, it had taken several days. The patient had started using plastic bags and newspaper to dress the wound when they ran out of dressings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Addendum - because this is getting a lot of views, I must stress that this case was exceptionally uncommon, and an example of what happens when someone does not seek medical attention when it is obviously required. In general, hernia operations are very common and very safe; that being said, if you have any surgical procedure and you are not certain the wound is healing properly, you must seek medical attention.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga3p2r5/" target="_blank"&gt; chewingthefatchungus &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mature-man-suffering-from-a-stomachache-vMFInKDh790" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-14/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065507"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065507" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-2-6882258d1926d-png__700.jpg" alt="Elderly person covering face, symbolizing patients who delayed help with shocking health consequences." title="Elderly person covering face, symbolizing patients who delayed help with shocking health consequences."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Had a patient brought in by her son who “took care of her,” when she arrived to our unit I performed a skin assessment...took off her socks and found a fallen off gangrenous toe.

It had been progressing over the last several years. But, if she didn’t get diagnosed with breast cancer, then she couldn’t have it. In the other category I’ve seen a few cases of Fournier’s Gangrene. Pretty much obese, male diabetics that had a pimple/sore that started in the pubic region. By the time they come to the hospital it’s a raging infection where the treatment is basically to cut away everything in the pubic/ groin region down to the muscle layer.

Got called in for an exploratory laparotomy. Some late staff had gotten the case ready and patient in the room when I arrived. I walked into the room to see the patients testicle was bigger then a basketball, two people holding it up to prep it. The guy had a large part of his bowel in his l ft testicle, and his bowel had ruptured due to the pressure. We suctioned poop out of his abdomen for over an hour. Apparently the week before he lifted something heavy and felt a pop. Hadn’t urinated in two days because it was so swollen his p***s was not visible. That’s why he finally came in, he couldn’t pee. Although his testicle had been slowly growing for a week. Unfortunately he didn’t make it, he lived thru 3 abdominal surgeries but sepsis did him in from the ruptured bowel.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4fc1g/" target="_blank"&gt; DynamoRN &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-in-a-surgical-gown-holding-up-a-surgical-light-KnSyar6rSUg" target="_blank"&gt; David Trinks / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-69/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065510"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065510" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-1-688225a31380b-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical team performing surgery in an operating room with vital signs monitor showing patient’s heart rate and status." title="Medical team performing surgery in an operating room with vital signs monitor showing patient’s heart rate and status."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Story from my SIL who is a nurse.

About 12 years ago I was asked to look at and give advice on a lady who had a very slow growing tumour on their nose. A Basel cell carcinoma. Usually not much of an issue as if caught early can be cut off with surgery and that's it or a short course of radiotherapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out this lady was quite vain, and as soon as the lump had started to grow she hid it under a scarf. She ended up hiding it for 20 years. By the time it was seen by any medical professional the tumor had taken over most of her nasal cavity, had crushed 1 eye, deformed her whole face, and grown inbetween all the nerves and blood vessels. It was inoperable and there was very little you could do with radiotherapy without doing alot of damage to everything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a shame as it would have been so easy to fix 20 years ago. Please get lumps and random bleeding checked out.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga44oyt/" target="_blank"&gt; PPENNYYY &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-person-holding-their-hand-to-their-face-y5QLKtUsqqA" target="_blank"&gt; engin akyurt / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-50/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065535"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065535" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor, but an Army medic.

I asked him what the f**k was going on. &lt;br&gt;Turns out, the weekend before we went out to the field, this man went and got his whole forearm tattooed. He then spent the next week wading through chest-deep swamps, figuring that if he just kept his arm wrapped, he’d be okay. &lt;br&gt;I was like...brother no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: oh yeah, there was also that time some female LT came in with vaginal pain. Took a look, saw one helluva infection. Apparently, she hadn’t changed her tampon in nearly a week.

So as the story went, his finger got swollen and painful about a week prior. Just got worse and worse, and about 3 days prior to coming, a hole opened up in the tip of his finger (this is where I, personally, would have noped right to the office).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So come the day of the visit, he says, “By the way, I pulled something out of the hole in my finger yesterday with a pair of tweezers, no idea what it is.” I asked him if he took a picture or kept it, and he produced a tissue from his shirt pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was his distal phalanx (read: last bone in the finger). The bone had gotten infected and the body did it’s thing and basically tried to eject what was now a hot foreign body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The guy pulled his fingertip out of his fingertip.

The worst I ever saw was a man in his 50’s who was an alcoholic and had anxiety problems who was brought in by his neighbors for a “facial infection”. Turned he had squamous cell skin cancer that made the left side of his face look like the Batman villain two face. The ct of his face and neck revealed that it had spread into his lymph nodes and mandible. The skin on his face was literally sloughing off as I spoke with him and the smell was absolutely horrible (and I smell terrible things all the time). I have never almost vomited in a room except for him just due to the smell. I asked him why he waited and he said he was just terrified of doctors and hospitals and I believe him. He was extremely anxious the entire time he was in our ED. His neighbors were saints, they said they had been trying to get him to the hospital for months but he wouldn’t come in. We transferred him to a tertiary hospital with ENT and cancer specialists.

He weighed 140kg, smoked heavily, ate nothing but food from the pie shop, and spent every night in the pub. The cardiologist told him he was basically about to die (true), and was put on five different medications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stopped drinking altogether, started exercising, quit smoking, ate nothing but salad. He lost 45kg, his diabetes reversed and he stopped some medications, his heart went back to 55% stroke volume (pretty much normal) and most of his HF meds were stopped, his blood pressure dropped to normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was "the happiest he'd ever been, and not just to be alive". After a couple of false starts, he found himself a decent girlfriend. He still went to the pub for the social aspects, but drank soda-water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a really decent bloke too, and was quite the inspiration to many people in the small country town where we were living at the time to improve their lives.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5zvuo2/comment/df1q6ur/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; PennyLisa &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065516"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065516" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My Dad is the one that wouldn't go in. He got a sore in the crease on the bottom of his second toe (the one next to the big toe, so it would be the Piggy That Stayed Home) and just kept ignoring it. He would go with his wife to her nail place and have his toe nails trimmed and I think that's where the infection probably got in when they soaked his feet. He blew it off for a couple of weeks until the wife made him see the doc. It's a good thing she did. The infection had gotten into the bone so they had to snip his toe off to the first knuckle to catch it before it went any further.

Had a guy come in at the end of the day for chest pain that’s been bothering him “all weekend”. The ED doc ordered a troponin blood test which helps rule in/out heart attacks. If the test runs above 0.03, we consider that a sign for a heart attack and act accordingly. This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through. Don’t ignore chest pains, people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Just wanna clarify that the hospital I work for is a tiny a*s, 25 bed, rural community critical care hospital. Definitely not a place with dedicated cardiologists, cath lab, bedside assays, or even a big test menu, period. Bare basics!

This is frustrating because we very rarely have the ability to get a patient in next day, and if they had called the day of or the day after then we definitely could have gotten them seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT my number one "why didn't you come in sooner?!" moment was getting a call from a patient who had broken their forearm *two months ago* and never followed up. I got them scheduled, they no showed their appointment. Rescheduled, they no showed. Second reschedule, they arrive with a very obvious deformity to their arm due to the fracture healing incorrectly. If they had just come in, it wouldn't have been an issue at all.

We can start with a gentleman in his 70s who was diagnosed with diabetes. His doctor had instructed him that it’s important for him to wear socks and supportive shoes throughout the day. So this guy decides that meant “wear the same pair of socks for weeks and never take them off.” He had showered, slept, and carried on in the same pair of socks for weeks. He came to the ER because there was blood oozing through his sock and there was pain under there. Take the sock off, he’s got a diabetic ulcer that had opened and was full of maggots. Not a pretty site. We clarified those instructions pretty quickly.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga42ygj/" target="_blank"&gt; mdm_pomfrey &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-sitting-on-a-bed-with-a-pair-of-socks-wJ4-Mw2NFVg" target="_blank"&gt; Andrej Lišakov / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-25/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065553"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065553" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-14-68821ce56f528__700.jpg" alt="Person in a turquoise shirt holding their stomach, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking health consequences." title="Person in a turquoise shirt holding their stomach, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking health consequences."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My favorite story (psych NP). I was called to a suburban ER to see a man who said he had a horrible stomach cancer and needed to lose weight in order to get better. He insisted that he'd been diagnosed by a very prominent gastroenterologist with "Barrett's stomach" which isn't even a thing (it's an esophageal problem). I guess I got called in because the story was bizarre and the staff didn't know what to do with him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He eventually disclosed that he'd shot himself in the leg a few days previously and was waiting for gangrene to set in. He believed that the resulting amputation of the leg would allow him to lose the required amount of weight, thus curing his cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I excused myself to let the ER staff know that they should probably examine the leg and to call the county psychiatric service, which was protocol at this particular hospital. I'm not sure what ever happened to him but that was a very impressive manifestation of a delusion!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4edvi/" target="_blank"&gt; _perl_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-holding-his-stomach-with-his-hands-J6g_szOtMF4" target="_blank"&gt; Towfiqu barbhuiya / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-47/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065566"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065566" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My dad works as a nurse in the ER.

A mum came into a and e with a little boy of about 4 or 5. Doc requested we come and entertain/ distract little man while he examined him and left it at that. He was happy, chatty and a picture of health from the shoulders up. His belly however looked like he was expecting very soon. This was a shock to both me and the other girl who had taken the usual toys (we had little baskets for each of us to take where needed). We trailed this little guy while he had a multitude of tests and he was extremely brave letting the docs do what they had to. Mum was asked how long it had been going on and she said 3 months. He had a tumour and the surgeons managed to remove it but the poor kid was so embarrassed after surgery because he had saggy skin and stretch marks. He often plays on my mind, even more so since having a kid of my own.

He has coband on his wrist which I peel off to see a 3X6cm hole in his wrist opening directly on his implanted wrist replacement, specifically on the poly insert that allows the two portions of the implants to glide on one another.

He would use the stumpy part to move around on his wheelchair and leave little blood sponge prints on the floor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another guy with bad ankle and foot wounds decided to stop going to wound care, and was afraid to take the wraps off even after his foot started to stink. By the time I saw him his skin had kinda liquified. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier on in my career I saw a guy with necrotizing wounds to both legs that had eaten to muscle in multiple places below the knee. I asked him how long they looked like that and he said about two years. Next time I saw him he was bilateral above knee amp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stump wounds. Just... Stump wounds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care of your feet people.

My first week went by with the usual stitches and broken bones. My second week around midnight, this very obese woman came in complaining of chest pains. So we rush her back, grab her vitals and do an EKG and blood work. Everything comes backs normal but this woman is still complaing of chest pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So my supervisor and I ask the lady if we can do a head to toe check up. Now this woman had a rather pungent smell to her when she came in but I've learned to not think of it, as people in the area weren't known for their cleanliness. So we're looking at her chest and I notice that her left breast was reddened and swollen. So I tell her that I'm going to lift up her breast to rule out any skin infections; as I lifted up her breast a wave of noxious stench engulfed the air around me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank the gods for facemasks. As I lifted up her breast even more I could seen what looked my a mass of rotting tissue going into her chest. Now my supervisor ran out of the exam room and proceeded to vomit in the nearest trash can. I looked at the lady and asked her why she didn't come in earlier as it looks like a massive skin infection was raging under her left breast. She replied that she didn't have insurance and that she didn't think it was a huge deal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I called in a few other nurses and the doctor to assist with cleaning the wound. Well as we begone cleaning, one nurse noticed a bit of fur and bone. As we further inspected, we come to find out its a small animal of sorts. So they collect the sample and sent it to pathology. After we removed said animal, we noticed that it had rotted into her chest so much that her ribs could be seen. In the end it ended up being the ladies missing kitten and she spent 4 months in the hospital for massive sepsis and other related issues.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga48lnn/" target="_blank"&gt; Travis123083 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065568"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065568" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Doctor here, might be a bit late and will probably be buried but had a 65 year old dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma 8 months before we saw him. He lived an hour out of the city and didn't want to drive in for treatment so decided he wouldn't get treated at all and stayed on his little remote place in the country by himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, because it didn't get treated, it spread along his skin and his neighbors called an ambulance when popping in on him. &lt;br&gt;It had spread so far that it essentially went from his head to his knees. It had started to invade his eyes and mouth membranes. He couldn't drink and could barely see. His skin had started to slough off and he was so severely dehydrated because he was losing so much excess fluid from his open skin that we had to treat him like a severe burns patient and had plastics involvement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consultant said if he had received treatment, there was a chance he could have recovered. Instead he died 3 weeks later.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4mxig/" target="_blank"&gt; kaloking &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-61/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065847"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065847" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Nurse here.

The witching hour was upon us and a man came in looking in some discomfort. He had a delicate issue in his nether regions. He was very embarrassed so off we went to a cubicle where he told us that he had fashioned himself a not-made-for-purpose cockring out of a large metal nut. Unfortunately there was no venous return possible and his p*nis had become oedematous (swollen) and painful. He thought (hoped) it might subside but then it started turning blue. By the time we saw it it was extremely swollen and turning black. If he thought he was saving himself embarrassment by waiting, he thought again when we called the fire brigade to bring their large cutting instruments to free his strangulated member.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: the urologist said he would keep his piece but may suffer functional problems in the future...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8iwvv8/comment/dyvh01w/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Xeynobrand &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-4/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065536"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065536" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Years ago as a nursing assistant on an oncology floor we had a guy admitted because he had had an erection for several days and had lost the ability to pee. His bladder was close to bursting and his poor junk was... think microwaved hotdog. Really bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But NONE of that was as interesting as the fact that this guy had untreated skin cancer on his nose for several years that had over time become infected, developed MRSA, and spread across his face. He had no nose, no cheek, and no eye on one side of his face, and was starting to lose his other eye. You could see part of his f*****g skull. I dont know why he chose to leave it untreated and I have no idea how long it took to get that bad, but I will never ever forget the smell and texture of his rotting face. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the upside, we were eventually able to convince him to have reconstructive surgery. He ended up getting a skin graft that covered up his eye, nose and cheek. So, if you ever meet a very grumpy dude with nothing but a mouth and one eye, know that this is way better than the alternative.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4cafr/" target="_blank"&gt; mzladyperson &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065559"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065559" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Doc here. This is far more common than you'd think. Even in Australia (where healthcare is free) I'd get several instances every week. The general populace is medically illiterate and/or willfully ignorant, especially so when I was working rurally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) A woman with a facial basal cell carcinoma (common and easily treatable skin cancer in the early phases) that she refused to acknowlege until it had eroded half of her face and developed a severe systemic infection that ended up k**ling her. I could see into the back of her nose from the side, one eyeball was being held in place only by muscle (the bony eye socket was completely gone) and she had no cheek on that side. This woman genuinely looked like a zombie. Poor thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Countless folks in their 30's who couldn't feel either of their feet due to permanent nerve damage from uncontrolled type 1 diabetes. It's a tough conversation to have when they ask "Can't you just fix them so I can go back to work?". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Last week. A previously *very* healthy gentleman in his 60s (we're talking several long bike rides every week) who had chest pain, breathlessness and some near faints for a few days. Rocks up to ED after collapsing with a cold right leg and his 'heart damage' markers are through the roof. Straight to theatre to have his coronary arteries stented. 100% blockage of the LAD (aka the Widowmaker), horrendous cardiogenic shock (c**p heart, c**p oxygen delivery to everything else), and since his heart hadn't been pumping properly a **HUGE** clot (static blood clots like mad) in the left ventricle of his heart that was flicking off mini-clots and cutting off the blood supply to half of his organs including an entire leg. Poor dude had clocked up 200km on his bike the previous week.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ao92/" target="_blank"&gt; Heaps_Flacid &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-52/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065560"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065560" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Last term medical student here. For part of your surgical rotation we had patients selected from the ER to be "student friendly" in regards to the symptoms they were seeing healthcare for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An elderly man had a lump in hos groin and was then selected to see me. Went in and talked to the patient aswell as examined him. The lump had trumbled him putting on his pants for a couple of months. He hadent shown his wife or no one else. I could instantly see that it wasnt a hernia as suspected, but a giant tumor with several lymphatic metastases, found around 5. T-cell lymfoma it turned out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dont know if he lived or not, as students we dont follow our patients for very long. The thing i'll never forget is the fact that he'd come straight from work, had a badge with his picture on it, and it looked like another person. It was like he was a husk of himself. His face was so skinny.&lt;br&gt;PS: Swedish medstudent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga46a5k/" target="_blank"&gt; me_and_my_rancor &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065561"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065561" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’m a nurse, and I am my own “Why didn’t you come in sooner!?” patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a sore throat and didn’t think much of it; my daughter had come home from school with strep a few days before. I spiked a temp, and let it ride. My head hurt, and my neck began to get stiff. Now I’m thinking “oh s**t, do I have meningitis??” Fever gets to 104, so I call my own doc and explain the symptoms. They essentially tell me to f**k off until tomorrow morning. I’m like “okay cool, I’ll take Advil and do that.” Well, lo and behold throughout the night my temp spiked higher and higher. I don’t remember much of what happened, but I know at some point my ex husband demanded I call in with my newest temp that was above 105, and they still told me to ride it out at home, so in my brain cooked state I thought “yeah, okay.” Well, thank goodness at one point my ex got fed up and fireman carried me to the car and drove me to the hospital I’d just finished my ER internship at. My temp was still 106 or above, and my HR was a bit much. What I remember most vividly was my shock at my triage rating lol 2/5! That’s what they made possible heart attacks. All the nurses and techs just kept judge shaking their heads at me like “duuuuuddee you know these things! Why didn’t you come in sooner???”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, nurses don’t seek care for s**t. Second of all, you try remembering common sense with a 106something Fever 😅.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4954k/" target="_blank"&gt; LyannasLament &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065581"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065581" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm still mad about it.

One day me and my partner got called to a house for the “unable to to ambulated”. This is a common thing we get dispatched to and it usual means someone is too weak to get out of a recliner or out of bed. We expected to go and help this person to their feet and maybe get a refusal, or transport them to the hospital based on an assessment. When we arrived on scene, a cop was there along with a neighbor who told us it was really bad in there. The second I walked through the door of the house, the smell hit me. I have smelled many dead decaying bodies that were not this pungent. We walk into the living room to find a man laying on the floor of his living room saying he could not get up. His legs were wrapped in what appeared to be plastic wrap and plastic bags. You could see the wrappings filled and dripping with brown liquid. The guy said he had started gettin sores on his feet and rather then go to a doctor, he elected to just wrap them up in plastic wrap. I don’t know how long he had been doing this but it had reached a point where he could no longer gather the strength to get up and he was extremely septic. It was HORRIBLE. We carried him out of the house and I was down at the legs and the gangrene juice was dripping all over me. The back of the ambulance smelled like death for days. We dropped him off at the hospital and I went outside and puked. I see nasty s**t every day but this was by far the nastiest. When they took the wrappings off in the ED, the nurses told me both his legs were completely black and rotten up to the knees. They had to amputate both legs up to the hip and they found the gangrene went up into his pelvis so they had to transfer him out for more surgery. I don’t know if he lived but if he had just gone to the doctor when it started he would have probably just found out he had diabetes and been given medication and lived many more years with two functioning legs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4n8x3/" target="_blank"&gt; bored-but-happy &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-76/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065605"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065605" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm late to the thread here but have to write this. I'm a 22yr paramedic and I once responded to a cardiac arrest where a police officer had called us after responding to a welfare check where she found a man unresponsive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We worked the guy but it was quite futile. The cop had started CPR after calling it in so we continued for a half hour or so with no response to treatment. Called it after he remained in asystole without a hint of a response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story was that the guy was out mowing his lawn when he began having chest pain. He stopped mowing, went inside, and called his wife who was at work. He told her he wasn't feeling well and wanted her to know. He then sat down in a living room chair, took out a notebook and started journaling his symptoms. The two sentences he wrote that I'll always remember are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My chest hurts. It's hard to breathe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I think I'm having a heart attack."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wife tried calling him back after an hour and couldn't get him on the phone. After another hour she called 911 to request the police do a welfare check. They found him in that living room chair next to his journal, dead as can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally this guy lived a block from our ambulance station. We hadn't had a call all morning until we responded to his house. He died a block away from me and my ambulance. I was just mucking about the station. Had he just called me I could have saved him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't be this guy. Call 911 for chest pain, folks. I'll come. It's ok.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4xge9/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-97/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065544"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065544" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Nurse here: Had a diabetic who couldn’t afford to fill his oil tank during the winter.

His sister went to check on him one day after she realized his phone was shut off by. She brought him in because she thought he seemed off. The doc asked me to take his boots off, one of his toes came off with the boot (no joke).

Since she knew she would be in the hospital for a few days and wanted to be out of the hospital for her sweet 16. A very long story short: she went unresponsive on the way to the hospital after passing out. She went into DIC and when she was allowed to pass she had 10L of blood products that were not hers. We tried everything we possibly could for 8 hours.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4e8ex/" target="_blank"&gt; scareraven &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-86/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065595"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065595" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Two patients come to mind: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first patient is a 50 something male alcoholic who, per his family, drinks "at least a gallon of Taylor Port a day". Over the previous month the patient became more and more confused, stopped drinking, and couldn't walk or recognize his family. So his family recognized that this was abnormal, but did nothing. They were concerned for him and tried encouraging him to drink, saying they were happy when he would drink but he had problems holding the glass. Came into the ED finally after becoming unresponsive. Lactate and ammonia throught the roof. GI bleed, suspected esophageal varies. Hgb like 5. Ended up having encephalopathy. He was wrecked up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second patient was in his twenties. I can't remember the specifics as it was 4 years ago and wasn't my patient. But this patient either took Viagra or had some sort of issue and had a erection that lasted 4 DAYS. YES 4 DAYS. His business was super engorged and purple/black even though he was relatively fair. He was too embarrassed to go to the ED. If I remember correctly the poor man ended up getting a partial penectomy and had a lot of complications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIP his peen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ibw8/" target="_blank"&gt; Chuckapplesauce &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-88/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065636"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065636" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Training as an EMT so not a doctor, but in the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old guy shuffles in with his girlfriend both mid-fifties. He is holding a “Members Only” jacket in front of his crotch and wobbling in. We take him through triage to the back and get him on the exam table. His scrotum was the size a large watermelon. It hung below his knees and was easily 18” in diameter. Serious hernia issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a big oblong mass of flesh that had overwhelmed the rest of his nethers. I think every physician in the Hospital came down to consult on it. I mean every one. Cardiologists, ENTs etc. everyone made an excuse to come take a look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was clearly an issue he had been avoiding for years. The prescribed treatment if I remember properly was to Kevlar reinforce his belly and shove all his intestines back up and in. They were going to transport him to a nearby by hospital for the treatment, but because it was across state lines he refused to go. So he slid off the table pulled his jeans up around his crotch, grabbed his jacket and his girlfriend and shuffled off to the bus stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s an image you never forgot, closest thing I can relate it to is when Hugh Jackman is trying to carry the fishbowl between his legs in The Prestige”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8iwvv8/comment/dyvzo37/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Rahodess &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9861/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065789"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065789" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The human capacity to deny the undeniable is amazing.

The patient had been found in a car in a parking lot, unconscious and obviously having trouble breathing. The guy had a huge mass in his right neck, around the size of a grapefruit. His oxygen level was frighteningly low, so the ED docs tried to intubate him. They couldn't pass the tube due to the mass making his airway around the size of a drinking straw. After repeated attempts, they called in the surgeons on call, which consisted of a chief surgical resident and a surgical intern. Those two attempted a bedside crike but also failed due to the neck mass. Finally after calling in other ED docs, they managed to pass a small tube and hook the guy up to a ventilator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I arrive, he's laying on the bed completely unresponsive. He has an ugly, gaping (but relatively shallow) wound in his throat packed with gauze from the failed crike. He has no reflexes at at all. His pupils are fixed and dilated. He isn't breathing on his own, relying entirely on the ventilator. The only thing he has is a pulse. The guy is dead, his heart just doesn't know it yet. We see this all the time... the patient will hold on for a little while until someone (ie family) decides to pull the breathing tube, at which point they'll die. So we get him upstairs to the ICU and I go back to sleep. I wake up an couple hours later and hand my patients, including the guy off to the day team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later that afternoon I wake up again and check up on him. Turns out he woke up around noon. He pulled out his breathing tube on his own. After coughing for a minute or two, he proceeded to loudly cuss out every person within 50 feet, asking why they didn't let him die. Turns out he's had this neck cancer for a while, and just wants to let it k**l him without doing anything about it. He just wanted to peacefully suffocate (??) and be left alone. He got out of bed, signed his AMA paper, and left the hospital. Never saw him again.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5zvuo2/comment/df1u6ru/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Dr_Everyone &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9871/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065538"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065538" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not me but my brother is an EMT for a warehouse. He recently had a guy come to his station saying something was wrong with his toe. So he asks him to take off his shoe, which he does. My brother was about to ask him to take off the bandage around his big toe before he realizes that that wasn't a bandage, it was his skin. Apparently, this guy dropped a 20 pound tote on his toe a week earlier and had been showing up at work anyway. They sent him to the doctor; the doctor sent him to the ER. Diagnosis came back as a tissue infection as well as osteomyelitis (a bone infection). But wait, there's more! The guy come back from the ER and tells him that he doesn't want to go through the ER doctor and would rather go through his own insurance. My brother explained to him as best as he could that, as it stood, he was already likely going to lose his toe and if he waited any longer to get it treated, he ran the risk of losing his entire leg. Not sure what happened after that, I just hope he got the point.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga3x2of/" target="_blank"&gt; Axikten &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065555"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065555" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I had a patient in the ER who struggled with alcoholism.

She ended up coding and had either esophageal varices or a massive dissecting aortic aneurysm, I don’t remember which. If she’d come in earlier in the week they probably could have saved her in surgery. It was sad, especially to see her family say goodbye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also the patient with diabetes who had wounded, caked leg sores. For **years**. That smell may never leave me.

It got ignored through ED(Because why look closely at an open head wound) and straight up to our floor, where we decided to clean her up. After cleaning up some of the blood, it seemed like the wound was moving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surely f*****g enough - maggots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ended up cleaning them out, but I raised both the question of “Why would you wait” and “Wait, you didn’t even come in because if this?”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga433yx/" target="_blank"&gt; athan1214 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-51/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065567"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065567" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;"My tooth has been hurting for a couple of months. My face started swelling a few days ago. It became hard to swallow last night and now I'm having trouble breathing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guy had Ludwig's Angina. He couldn't be intubated because of the swelling and had to get an emergency trach when he stopped breathing and his O2 stats plummeted. IV antibiotics for 2 weeks. Admitted to the hospital for 4 weeks. Easily could have died. All because of a dental infection. SEE YOUR DENTIST, BOYS AND GIRLS! (I'm a dentist and saw this when I was on call during my hospital residency)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: To the people who are yelling at me "Yeah, well, insurance! I don't see you paying for it! It's too expensive!" -- I get it. Dental insurance is NOT insurance. It's a discount program you pay for, or it's a benefit from your employer. In this instance, the patient had state medical and dental coverage -- it covered all exams, fillings, and extractions. He still didn't come in until it was really bad. He didn't pay a dime for the care he received. I also worked in my residency seeing 90% medicaid patients. The other 10% were charity cases. I am acutely aware of the problems with cost for dentistry and access to care. Blame the insurance companies, not the dentist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are looking for cheaper dental care, look into dental schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers. The former works at ~50% private practice fees. The latter works on sliding scales. In the meantime, DO WHAT YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOUR TEETH. Dollar store has toothbrushes and toothpaste. Actually use them. A VAST majority of dental problems can be prevented with adequate oral hygiene. Cut out soda from your diet, get rid of energy drinks, don't live off of candy and cookies. Get in at LEAST once a year for an exam.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4bqbg/" target="_blank"&gt; Kliarin &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-60/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065572"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065572" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Had an older female patient come in for abnormal labs secondary to extreme diarrhea.

While these findings are early and need much more research, they hint at a potential future role for stevia in tackling pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00261-2/abstract"&gt;Pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat. Symptoms typically appear only after the disease has spread, and conventional therapies like chemotherapy rarely result in a cure. The outlook is bleak: fewer than 10% of patients &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-prognosis"&gt;survive five years&lt;/a&gt; beyond diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sweetener-could-damage-critical-brain-barrier-risking-stroke?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Common Sweetener Could Damage Critical Brain Barrier, Risking Stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This urgent need for more effective and less toxic treatments has driven researchers to explore plant-based compounds. Many chemotherapy drugs already used today &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5588531/"&gt;have botanical origins&lt;/a&gt; – including &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/taxol"&gt;paclitaxel, derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/blog/vinblastine-and-vincristine-life-saving-drugs-from-a-periwinkle/"&gt;vincristine, sourced from the Madagascar periwinkle&lt;/a&gt; – offering a proven pathway for discovering new cancer-fighting agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4890837/"&gt;Stevia&lt;/a&gt;, a leafy plant native to South America, is widely known for its natural sweetness. It's a familiar presence on supermarket shelves, but few think of it as a medicinal plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169062" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant.jpg" alt="Stevia Plant" class="wp-image-169062 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169062" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stevia appears to hold intriguing anti-cancer properties. (yul38885/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia leaves are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10420666/"&gt;rich in bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, some of which have shown hints of anticancer and antioxidant activity &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8874712/"&gt;in previous research&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge has been harnessing this potential, as unfermented stevia extracts are only mildly effective in laboratory settings, often requiring high doses to affect cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where fermentation comes in. Known for creating &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fermented-foods-sustain-both-microbiomes-and-cultural-heritage-221564"&gt;yogurt, kimchi and sourdough&lt;/a&gt; bread, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/10/7/330"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; is more than a culinary technique. I's a form of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/gut-microbiome-meet-lactobacillus-brevis-a-fermentation-superstar-213323"&gt;microbial alchemy&lt;/a&gt; that can transform plant compounds into new, bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Hiroshima University asked a simple but innovative question: what if stevia was fermented with the right bacteria? They experimented with a strain called &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; SN13T&lt;/a&gt;, a relative of a bacteria commonly found in fermented foods. Fermentation produced a compound called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12154053/"&gt;chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME)&lt;/a&gt;, which showed much stronger anti-cancer effects than raw stevia extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the fermented stevia extract caused pancreatic cancer cells to die in large numbers but left healthy kidney cells largely unharmed. Further analysis revealed that CAME was responsible for this effect. It worked by blocking cancer cells at a specific phase of their life cycle, preventing them from multiplying and by &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/apoptosis"&gt;triggering apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, a natural process where cells self-destruct when damaged or no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAME seems to alter the genetic programming of cancer cells. It activates genes that promote cell death while simultaneously suppressing those that help cancer cells grow and survive. This double hit both slows cancer progression and encourages malignant cells to kill themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of fermentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia extract was also found to be a stronger antioxidant than its unfermented counterpart. &lt;a href="https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-023-01398-5"&gt;Oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – an imbalance of potentially harmful moelcules known as free radicals in the body — is linked to cancer and other diseases. By neutralizing these free radicals more effectively, the fermented extract may offer extra protection for healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time fermentation has been shown to unlock hidden benefits. Fermented &lt;a href="https://journal.waocp.org/article_24814_93ecca7dbb764adbffb869ef1b886d1c.pdf"&gt;soy and ginseng&lt;/a&gt; have been found to offer enhanced health properties compared to their raw forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the stevia findings stand out because of the compound's selectivity. Killing cancer cells while sparing healthy ones is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;the holy grail&lt;/a&gt; for cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that these results come from lab-grown cells, not from animal or human studies. Many substances that look promising in petri dishes fail in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169059" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; due to the complexity of the human body. Still, the discovery is exciting and warrants further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the potential of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;everyday foods&lt;/a&gt; and their natural microbes as untapped sources of new medicines. It also reflects growing interest in "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4293675/"&gt;biotransformation&lt;/a&gt;" – using beneficial bacteria to create powerful compounds from plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of stevia, a simple quest for a natural sweetener has evolved into something potentially far more profound: a stepping stone toward a cancer therapy that's natural, targeted and cost-effective.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261599/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new simulation study shows that higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="168528" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; vaccination rates protect both vaccinated and unvaccinated people from infection – though those who get the jab &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-a-staggering-154-million-lives-in-the-last-50-years"&gt;get the most protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh ran computer simulations modeling 1.2 million people in a US county. The simulations were set up to measure the day-to-day &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-flu-is-different-this-year-and-cases-are-surging-an-expert-explains-why"&gt;spread of flu&lt;/a&gt; through households, schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simulations were used to test how a vaccine with 40 percent effectiveness fared in a range of &lt;span&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt; seasons with different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intense-flu-surge-gripping-the-us-is-the-worst-in-years-cdc-says"&gt;transmission rates&lt;/a&gt; and levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-a-few-antivaxxers-can-triple-annual-disease-rates-new-study-shows"&gt;vaccine uptake&lt;/a&gt;. Each simulation was also run 100 times over, with averages worked out from the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-vaccine-for-covid-and-the-flu-promises-to-be-a-big-win-for-public-health?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Single Vaccine For COVID And The Flu Promises to Be a Big Win For Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vaccination rates reached 51 percent of the population, total &lt;span&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt; cases were reduced by 32.9 to 41.5 percent, depending on the severity of the &lt;span&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;. Benefits were seen in vaccinated people, and to a lesser extent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccination-rates-in-the-us-could-be-close-to-a-dangerous-tipping-point"&gt;unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For viral strains similar to ones circulating during seasonal influenza, vaccination provided indirect benefit to unvaccinated individuals, but the direct benefit to vaccinated individuals was always greater," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21324"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/emergency-vaccines-reduce-disease-outbreak-deaths-by-almost-60"&gt;getting yourself vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, you're giving yourself a significantly better chance of avoiding infection – as well as protecting those around you, even if they haven't been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important for people who &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html"&gt;cannot receive vaccination for medical reasons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168531" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VaccineChart.jpg" alt="Vaccination chart" class="wp-image-168531 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VaccineChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VaccineChart-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168531" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study showed how as vaccine effectiveness went up, cases of disease went down. (Krauland et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Netw. Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More vaccinated people means fewer infections overall, the study showed. In communities, the subsequent effect is that the vaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-driving-vaccine-hesitancy-amid-a-global-pandemic-psychologists-break-it-down"&gt;and unvaccinated alike&lt;/a&gt; are exposed to fewer people with disease, and this study helps to quantify that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this shouldn't be used as an excuse for eligible people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-rational-people-skip-vaccines-even-when-they-trust-science"&gt;to skip vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;. In the simulations, people who weren't vaccinated had a 43 to 73 percent higher chance of catching the &lt;span&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the protection for unvaccinated people was pretty much wiped out in scenarios where the bug spread quickly – as in the early stages of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-herd-immunity"&gt;the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Directly vaccinating as many people as possible is still crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when both vaccine effectiveness and vaccine uptake were low, vaccination showed marked reductions in disease burden for transmission levels characteristic of seasonal influenza," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21324"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, when the level of transmission was very high, even a highly effective vaccine did not protect unvaccinated individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study matches up with &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2399-4"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that shows how vaccinated groups can protect the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can also see in the data here are the limitations of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;: where a population develops sufficient resistance to an infection, through natural immunity or vaccinations, that the spread of the infection becomes limited, helping to protect unvaccinated people. That indirect protection isn't enough for fast-spreading pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and time again the stats have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-37-million-children-s-lives-in-lower-income-countries-since-2001"&gt;vaccinations reduce preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt;, and this latest research adds to that pile of evidence – which is worth highlighting as childhood vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/romania/press-releases/childhood-vaccination-rates-lag-europe-fueling-further-resurgence-measles-and"&gt;are declining&lt;/a&gt; in some parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to prevent infectious diseases," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21324"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers. "It not only reduces disease in the vaccinated portion of a population but also potentially provides indirect benefit to the unvaccinated portion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21324"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Intriguingly, the drugs seemed to have reduced their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-link-between-alzheimers-and-cancer-may-finally-be-explained?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Mysterious Link Between Alzheimer's And Cancer May Finally Be Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease comes with complex changes to the brain, which has made it tough to study and treat, but our computational tools opened up the possibility of tackling the complexity directly," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Marina Sirota, from UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're excited that our computational approach led us to a potential combination therapy for Alzheimer's based on existing FDA-approved medications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169045" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169045" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54%E2%80%AFpm-642x494.png" alt="Certain Cancer Drugs May Reverse Brain Changes That Occur During Alzheimer's" class="wp-image-169045 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-642x494.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-539x415.png 539w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-768x591.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-600x462.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm.png 869w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169045" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The application of letrozole and irinotecan reduced the level of tau proteins (light green) in mouse brains. (Li et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having picked out letrozole and irinotecan as the best candidates, the researchers tested them in mouse models of Alzheimer's. When used in tandem, the drugs were shown to reverse some of the brain changes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;brought on by the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harmful clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt; that build up in brains affected by Alzheimer's were reduced significantly, and the mice showed improvements in learning and memory tasks – two brain capabilities often impaired by Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the two drugs together, the researchers were able to target different types of brain cells affected by the disease. Letorozole seemed to counter Alzheimer's in neurons, while irinotecan worked in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yadong Huang, from UCSF and Gladstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes it very challenging for drug development – which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a promising start, but there's more work to be done: obviously the drugs have only been directly tested in mice so far, and these medications also come with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/letrozole/side-effects-of-letrozole/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; attached. They need to be reconsidered if the drugs are going to be repurposed for a different disease than what they were originally approved for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next steps should be clinical trials for people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. According to the researchers, this approach could lead to more personalized and effective treatments, based on how gene expression has been altered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;more than 55 million people&lt;/a&gt; have Alzheimer's today, and as the world's population ages, that's expected to more than double in the next 25 years. Finding ways to prevent the disease and even reverse symptoms would have a huge impact on global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If completely independent data sources, such as single-cell expression data and clinical records, guide us to the same pathways and the same drugs, and then resolve Alzheimer's in a genetic model, then maybe we're on to something," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sirota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hopeful this can be swiftly translated into a real solution for millions of patients with Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As long as you make certain choices like adding the best foods for better cholesterol levels to your plate and following your doctor’s advice, you can make huge strides in keeping “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels down and “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, educator at Pritikin Longevity Center; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentara.com/medicalservices/sentara-health-research-center/for-researchers/experts/talreja-deepak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deepak Talreja, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Deepak Talreja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, clinical chief of cardiology for Sentara Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your LDL cholesterol levels determine, essentially, how clogged your arteries are or can become by a build-up of fat and other substances called plaque. The more clogged they are, the higher your levels may become, and the more difficult it is for your body to circulate blood, which raises heart attack, stroke, and blood clot risk according to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/Cholesterol/My-LDL-Cholesterol-Guide.pdf?sc_lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29897866/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that dietary modifications—especially lowering saturated fats, avoiding trans fats, increasing soluble fiber, and including plant sterols/stanols—can significantly reduce LDL cholesterol by 5 to 30% depending on adherence and genetics,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, educator at Pritikin Longevity Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet can help manage cholesterol by reducing the unhealthy fats you take in, but also, certain nutrients can help your body flush out damage that has already been done. For example: “Increasing soluble fiber binds cholesterol in the gut and removes it from the body,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.sentara.com/medicalservices/sentara-health-research-center/for-researchers/experts/talreja-deepak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deepak Talreja, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Deepak Talreja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, clinical chief of cardiology for Sentara Health. Healthy fats, like those found in nuts and seeds, can raise HDL levels and balance things out by lowering triglycerides, a type of fat that also contributes to heart disease, says Dr. Talreja. Lastly, nutrients called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/17368-phytosterols-sterols--stanols" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phytosterols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phytosterols&lt;/a&gt; found in fruits and vegetables may block the absorption of bad cholesterol, he adds. And, replacing animal proteins with plant-based ones can help you avoid cholesterol-raising proteins found in fatty cuts of main dish meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to lower cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend eating more of these foods to help lower cholesterol naturally and boost cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oats and barley&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These grains are high in the soluble &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5810204/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber beta-glucan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, which binds to cholesterol in the gut and removes it from the body via waste, says Theran. You can have oats for breakfast and barley for dinner, mixed into a hearty soup, says Dr. Talreja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lentils and beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in soluble fiber and plant-based protein, legumes help slow digestion and reduce cholesterol absorption, says Theran. Dr. Talreja adds that they can also help stabilize blood sugar and are great added to salad, soups, or wraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which lower triglycerides and may raise HDL cholesterol, says Theran. Dr. Talreja recommends aiming for at least two servings of fatty fish per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts like almonds and walnuts contain healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, and plant sterols that help lower LDL cholesterol, says Theran. Dr. Talreja says a small daily handful (around one ounce) is heart-healthy and enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avocado&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado is rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber, which may lower LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL, Theran explains. Dr. Talreja recommends using it in place of butter or cheese on toast and sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil is high in heart-protective antioxidants and monounsaturated fat, which can reduce inflammation and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3315351/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL oxidation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL oxidation&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical reaction that leads to inflammation and the formation of plaque, says Theran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apples, berries, citrus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fruits contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber that binds to bad cholesterol and can help carry it out of the body through the digestive tract, says Dr. Talreja. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22190137/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2012 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; found that certain types of pectin are better than others at helping to lower cholesterol. Dr. Talreja’s tip is to eat the skin when possible for maximum fiber benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark leafy green veggies and okra are especially good for cholesterol because they’re low in calories, high in fiber, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6413025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in plant sterols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in plant sterols&lt;/a&gt; that block cholesterol absorption, says Theran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Soy protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu, soy milk, and edamame contain plant-based proteins and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4924202/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isoflavones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isoflavones&lt;/a&gt;, which are plant compounds that can be anti-inflammatory and modestly lower LDL, says Theran. You can easily use tofu or tempeh as a meat substitute in stir-fries and bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Green tea&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that helps reduce cholesterol absorption and improve lipid profiles, says Theran, so long as you don’t overdo the added cream or sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are uniquely rich in lycopene, an antioxidant that &lt;a href="https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122(10)00446-9/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may help;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may help&lt;/a&gt; prevent LDL cholesterol from being oxidized, and therefore, may prevent plaque buildup in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which helps trap cholesterol in the gut, aiding in its removal from the body. They have also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10339661/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:been shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;been shown&lt;/a&gt; to improve HDL levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A heart-healthy diet rich in plants, fiber, and healthy fats—especially within a Mediterranean or plant-based framework—is a powerful tool in lowering cholesterol,” says Dr. Talreja. “Combined with regular exercise, this approach gives people the best chance at reducing cardiovascular risk and living longer, healthier lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report, which was produced by researchers at the Medical Research Council’s epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge involved a systematic review of 51 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It drew on data from more than 29 million participants who had been exposed to air pollutants for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although air pollution has already been identified as a risk factor for dementia, the research, which is the most comprehensive study of its kind to date, found there to be a positive and statistically-significant association between three types of air pollutant and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pollutants were: PM2.5, which comes from vehicle emissions, power plants and woodburning stoves and fireplaces; nitrogen dioxide, which arises from the burning of fossil fuels; and soot, which comes from sources such as vehicle exhaust emissions and burning wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When inhaled, these pollutants can penetrate deep into the lungs and are associated with various respiratory diseases and an increased risk of certain heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More specifically, the study found that for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5, an individual’s relative risk of dementia would increase by 17%. Using equivalent figures for soot, the risk rose by 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Soot and PM2.5 levels approached or exceeded these levels in 2023 at roadside locations in central London, Birmingham and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f029109e-a956-4175-b95f-271ccd119cd7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"UK air pollution falling but danger levels still breached too often, say scientists","elementId":"f029109e-a956-4175-b95f-271ccd119cd7","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/15/uk-air-pollution-falling-but-danger-levels-still-breached-too-often-say-scientists"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease and in the UK about 982,000 people have the illness. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty concentrating and mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Haneen Khreis, the senior author of the study, said it provided “further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Air pollution may cause dementia through causing inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress, which is a chemical process within the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers acknowledged that the report was limited because the majority of studies analysed included participants who were white and living in high income countries. They said future studies on air pollution should include more participants from marginalised backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Isolde Radford, senior policy manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “This rigorous review adds to mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution – from traffic fumes to wood burners – increases the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Air pollution is one of the major modifiable risk factors for dementia – but it’s not something individuals can solve alone. That’s where government leadership is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While the 10-year health plan acknowledges the health harms of air pollution, far more needs to be done to tackle this invisible threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling for a bold, cross-government approach to health prevention – one that brings together departments beyond health, including Defra, to take coordinated action on the drivers of dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report was published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00118-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPTF9ZX1czMjlyRG12WTc4MTd4SnVEc1hyQU9FMm9WLW0zUkRKRzFYQjQwWHNzX2x3LURfeDJhZ2tJOWdTVm9aVmxKVFN2akFRYWJSdVhkY3BDOHBidVhnQy1udloxRzktV2ZoTzA1dDBZcVhyclZ4TFJ6Tm5zQlNHVjFQYXdfQ0VWYkMwMFE3VHFmRGZxZVN6VV91TFdWcHZyUUlibWtTZHFmOTJvbFJhNS1TeTY</guid></item><item><title>在商店购买无麸质食品的威尔士借记卡- BBC | Wales debit card to pay for gluten free food in shops - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1iN2lvRWFjMG1Eb184MS1NLTM2ZkY1c3pndF96X29KMjZGZ0RwN051MV9UZmE3VnFJZ0djYkNhenZqYlM2SUN0bmVwTkZNeXRmMmQ2RGtnX2xVZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBRTVJacVp3S1lXeGQyZlNRYTFDeFNJUG02T3FOUzdmSDFtRE5SSHZYbUFqNHI2QWlTOTNwOXJ0b05vTF94UFNuQ3RMV0dwRi1nV1l2R0lfbkwzX2w1eUVz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Cash cards to pay for gluten-free food in UK first&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Lola Mayor &amp;amp; Jordan Davies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Wales News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Cherylee Barker smiles at the camera.

(WCBD) — A Columbia family is mourning the loss of their young son, who died after &lt;a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/south-carolina-news/case-of-brain-eating-amoeba-reported-in-south-carolina-officials-confirm/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.counton2.com/news/south-carolina-news/case-of-brain-eating-amoeba-reported-in-south-carolina-officials-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;contracting a rare brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt; from swimming in a popular lake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old student at Hand Middle School, died on July 18 after developing an infection associated with Naegleria fowleri in Lake Murray, according to a statement released by the family’s attorney. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jaysen’s family is grieving this unthinkable loss, but they are also grateful at the outpouring of love and support they have received from the community,” attorney Tyler Bailey of the Bailey Law Firm wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The firm said it was hired by the Carr family to conduct an independent investigation into their son’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The family has many questions about how and why Jaysen died and wants to do everything in their power to ensure this doesn’t happen to another family,” the statement continued. “Jaysen’s family would like to thank the doctors and nurses at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital-Midlands for their dedicated care and compassion for him and their entire family. We ask for privacy at this time as the family prepares to lay their son to rest.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) stated it became aware of a case of Naegleria fowleri in early July, the first in the state since 2016. Cases are not required to be reported to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Naegleria fowleri is a microscopic organism that occurs naturally in soil and warm freshwater sources, including lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). In rare cases, it can be found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and tap water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is most often contracted when water containing the amoeba enters through a person’s nose while swimming. The amoeba can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue, causing an infection known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections have also occurred in a few instances when people used tap water to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages, as was the case with a &lt;a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/national-news/woman-dies-from-brain-eating-amoeba-after-using-tap-water-to-clear-sinuses-cdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas woman who died&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infection cannot, however, be contracted by swallowing water containing the amoeba or be spread to others, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though PAM is rare — typically affecting fewer than 10 people a year in the U.S. — it is almost always fatal, experts say. The CDC reported that of the 167 reported cases between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of the infection typically appear about five days after exposure, but can occur anywhere between one and 12 days after, according to the CDC. They include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the infection progresses, health experts say symptoms including stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance, and hallucinations can happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina officials said there is no greater risk to the public, and the chances of contracting the infection remain low. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;People can further reduce their risk of infection by limiting the amount of water that forcefully enters their nose by holding it or wearing a nose clip when jumping or diving in fresh water. &lt;/p&gt;

A month later, doctors removed a golf ball-sized tumor from the pup’s lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;“He came home and healed up perfectly,” Abay said. “He acted like a puppy again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;It was life as usual, Ducky tolerating his cat siblings, scarfing down pup cups and posing for his annual “13 Days of Halloween” photo series on Instagram.

She dotes on him and knows all of his quirks, like how he presses his nose against her calf after an outdoor potty break. Abay also grew up with dogs and is program director at the &lt;a href="https://www.thehsnc.org/"&gt;Humane Society of Navarro County&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, so when something seems off, she notices right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Five months after his surgery, as Ducky sat on Abay’s lap and she gently pet his legs, she felt a lump. “I immediately got concerned because I figured it was a lymph node, and none of his others were swollen,” Abay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;Ducky’s oncologist confirmed Abay’s worst fears. Her baby had cancer again. This time, it was large cell lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;“I was crushed,” Abay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="4"&gt;Despite the flood of sadness washing over her for a second time, she focused on the good news. They caught the cancer early, so it hadn’t spread to Ducky’s organs. Survival was possible if he started chemotherapy right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="5"&gt;Every three weeks, Abay and an anxious Ducky woke up before sunrise and drove nearly two hours to an oncologist for treatment. Even though he was visibly scared, brave Ducky would walk in for chemo anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="ConnatixVideostyles__ConnatixVideoWrap-sc-woid5f-0 ktIfME connatix-article-mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="7"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Abay had heard that Shih-Tzus like Ducky are more likely to shed during chemo because their coats are more like hair than fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Sure enough, after his first chemo dose, Ducky’s hair started thinning. “He looked rough at times,” Abay said.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCK HAVEN, Pa. — June 23rd is a day that Kelly Brown will never forget. It's when her daughter, Brittany, noticed it was becoming harder for her mother to do simple tasks around her Allison Township home. That's when Brittany decided to take her mother to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They did all of the testing that we were asking for, but nobody thought of ticks, and it's not something that they do as a standard," said Kelly Brown, Allison Township. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown says she was sent home and followed up with her primary care doctor after she got her results back, noticing she was slowly losing blood. A week later, brown started feeling worse and went back to the ER, but was sent home a second time. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, brown's daughter took her to Geisinger near Danville and spoke with the Hematology Department. The next day, doctors diagnosed her with babesiosis, a parasite found in ticks that finds a home in red blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The red blood cells, or of course those cells which carry oxygen around in your body, and over time, if the infection is severe enough, then that can result in what we call anemia, where your blood counts get too low," said Doctor Stanley Martin, Geisinger Director of Infectious Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babesiosis comes from a tick bite when they're in the nymph stage.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They started treating me with antibiotics, and then also because it was a parasitic issue, they started treating me with basically malaria medication," said Brown. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown remained hospitalized for a few days and needed a blood transfusion after her hemoglobin level dropped. After the transfusion, she says the medications started to kick in, and late last week, she was finally able to go home. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown says she's unsure where she got the tick bite since she's not an outdoorsy person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stanley Martin, the Director of Infectious Diseases at Geisinger, says there are ways to protect yourself against ticks, such as using repellent, wearing long sleeves or pants, and checking yourself for ticks when you get inside, "If you're really concerned, take off your clothes, wash them right then and there to help get rid of any ticks or even take a shower yourself to make sure that you're removing any that might be attached."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown tells Newswatch 16 she's not only thankful for the doctors and nurses at Geisinger but also for those who donate blood, "They helped me, they probably saved my life, actually, and I don't know how many people donate blood, but it's really, really important."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

(WSET) — &lt;/span&gt;Four-year-old Charlie Townes is facing a challenging battle against a rare neurological condition known as KCNB1 disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His grandmother, Agnes Rucker, described his condition, saying, "Just like a floppy little faun at times. It's really been hard to see that, but then you see the breakthroughs like now, and just pray that it keeps getting better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erika Axeen, a pediatric epileptologist at the University of Virginia, has been treating Charlie since he was two years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, Charlie's seizures have become extremely difficult to control, which is typical for this disorder," said Dr. Axeen. "So we've had the frustrating experience of trying and failing multiple anti-seizure medications, and despite having tried multiple medications, he continues to have frequent seizures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Axeen noted that KCNB1 disorder is rare, with just over 100 cases reported in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disorder affects children's behavior and movements, can lead to intellectual disabilities, and causes seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Charlie, these challenges have been significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/jefferson-forest-virginia-student-scheduled-to-have-heart-surgery-protein-losing-enteropathy-cody-beck-july-2025" target="_blank" title="https://wset.com/news/local/jefferson-forest-virginia-student-scheduled-to-have-heart-surgery-protein-losing-enteropathy-cody-beck-july-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Jefferson Forest student scheduled for heart surgery after being on transplant list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father, Clayton Townes, expressed his concerns, saying, "It's a lot so because, I mean, like I said, he has no balance, and you're scared he's gonna fall, hit his head, or fall and hurt himself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of a cure, a new procedure involving the implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator offers hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Axeen explained, "Repeated stimulation over the course of months and years, it can actually reduce the frequency of seizures, and that pairs with medications to help control the seizures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clayton Townes is hopeful about the potential benefits of the VNS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping that that'll come back his emotion. You know, without the medicine being so, you know, having to have so much medicine, that's what I'm thinking. But the VNS might help out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucker continues to have hope as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been tears and just asking God to intervene to give him some normalcy," Rucker said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From treatments to traveling to appointments, this has been a financial strain on the Townes family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to donate to help, you can click this &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-charlie-townes-overcome-kcnb1-disorder?attribution_id=sl:2ee0813e-1bc2-4a09-9f36-c50566775c0a&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1753385578&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=sms" target="_blank" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-charlie-townes-overcome-kcnb1-disorder?attribution_id=sl:2ee0813e-1bc2-4a09-9f36-c50566775c0a&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1753385578&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=sms" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSET</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 20:57:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxQeE4yclZqZnI1R0ZHMjBhVnBNbllwNjh2NEZnNjFJRExfYUlRbS1QSmI1ZVo4X0tqMWpTUFFVdW1yWFdrYWVlbzhvUlVGekJhTTVkVy1ZZTljbEF6M1cxNzNFQ0FzU2lMank4MENaS3BNY3lTN1RNT19OQ0Mxd0kxWjh2WXBCNXpIMnNhVC1zU3BiQndVcEZRbXVqQktmT0NaX0lRUm8tSXdBYmhoT0xGV0F0WmZ1TnhSTGNxSEtlSFl0MW5BLVBsdmRRMFNreXV2LUhQaDQxZzFHMWNXY1BiRFpXWTYzSl9xSUE</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，为了肠道健康，您应该吃的排名第一的碳水化合物- EatingWell | The #1 Carb You Should Eat for Gut Health, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFB0QlVWa1NwdVI0MEhKblpwWVIzYXZiWG9kSDRRdUlsM0FlTG5kSDYzTjRBTjJibnB6d01WMTZlclY0V2Z6QWR4RHBEdUNTWk5tSUJsdGktSE41MUJTWWx0a1BXT0hXUV9tQUxwazZKZV9xQUhxaXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber- and antioxidant-rich chickpeas are dietitians’ favorite carb for gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas may fight inflammation, improve digestion and support good gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From salads to soups, stews and burgers, they’re tasty, versatile and convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs often get a bad rap, but not all carbs are created equal. Yes, some may leave you feeling sluggish, spike your blood sugar or bring on digestive woes. However, others can do wonders for your body, especially your gut. “Gut health is key to feeling your best,” says &lt;a href="https://eatswimwin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Eat Swim Win. “A balanced gut helps keep your mood steady by regulating hormones and supports your immune system to fight off illness.  And, let’s face it, no one wants to walk around feeling bloated or uncomfortable.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re looking for a carb that’s been proven to do good things for your digestive health, dietitians recommend chickpeas. Yes, chickpeas! Those small yet mighty legumes aren’t just a fantastic base for hummus or a protein-rich addition to your salad. They’re packed with gut-health benefits that deserve a round of applause.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is a type of carbohydrate that your body can’t digest. It plays a crucial role in keeping your digestive system healthy by regulating bowel movements and supporting the growth of good gut bacteria. Just one half-cup of cooked chickpeas provides 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since most of us don’t get enough fiber to begin with, that’s good news for digestive health, says &lt;a href="http://thedietitiandish.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Dish, LLC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, chickpeas contain two different types of fiber—soluble fiber and insoluble fiber—which each work in different ways to promote gut health, she says. For instance, soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance, which helps to slow digestion and support the absorption of nutrients. On the other hand, insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool, aiding in its passage through the digestive system to prevent constipation. This dual action contributes to a balanced gut environment and improves overall digestive efficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Feed Your Good Gut Bacteria &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chickpeas are rich in resistant starch, which helps feed the good bacteria in the gut and boost the production of short-chain fatty acids,” says &lt;a href="http://www.whollynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jaime Bachtell-Shelbert, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Wholly Nourished. If you’ve never heard of resistant starch or short-chain fatty acids before, we’ll explain. Resistant starch is a special type of fiber known as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic fiber&lt;/a&gt;. After we eat chickpeas, their resistant starch travels intact to the colon. When it gets there, your good gut bacteria ferment it for food, helping to promote their growth and activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During this process, your good gut bacteria produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which nourish your gut lining to keep it strong and healthy and protect against disease-causing inflammation. Research has found that SCFAs may also help reduce the risk of colon cancer. If that weren’t enough, SCFAs additionally foster communication between your brain and your gut, so they may support emotional well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpeas’ gut-health benefits aren’t just about their fiber. These powerful legumes also contain antioxidants called phenolic acids that promote gut health in several ways. For instance, research has found that phenolic compounds may reduce inflammation that can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt; symptoms and may play a role in the onset of inflammatory bowel disease.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hard-working phenolics also tighten gaps in the gut membrane, forming a tight seal that locks out disease-causing bacteria. And, like fiber, phenolic compounds promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

But it’s essential in your diet, and it keeps your body running smoothly. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a41431425/zinc-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; boosts your immune system, helps wounds heal, and supports healthy development during pregnancy and childhood, per &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;. And not getting enough of it can disrupt everything from your skin to your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zinc deficiency is pretty rare in the U.S., some groups are at higher risk than others, per the NIH. People with eating disorders, substance use disorders, and gastrointestinal conditions are most at risk for true zinc deficiency, explains &lt;a href="https://www.vitalrd.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Crandall, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Crandall, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Vital RD. Vegetarians and vegans are also at higher risk, because many &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g39502942/foods-with-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc-rich;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc-rich&lt;/a&gt; foods are animal-based, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned you’re not getting enough of the nutrient? Here are eight telltale signs of zinc deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinc deficiency symptoms can range a lot, depending on your age. But one of the most common symptoms—especially in older adults—is slow-healing wounds, per the NIH. Zinc plays a key role in your immune system, helping your body &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63025471/does-zinc-help-colds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fight off infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fight off infections&lt;/a&gt; and heal injuries. So if you notice that cuts and scrapes are taking longer to close up, low zinc may be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PhotoAlto/Odilon Dimier - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your hair starts thinning or falling out, low zinc may be to blame. Zinc deficiency can result in &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/a45919873/how-much-hair-loss-is-normal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hair loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, especially in older children, per &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/#h1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. And low zinc levels have also been linked to several hair loss conditions, including alopecia areata (an autoimmune condition), telogen effluvium (stress-induced temporary hair loss), and male pattern baldness, per a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5315033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;FG Trade - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acne&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acne may not be a common zinc deficiency symptom, but it can be a sign you need more of the nutrient. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860489/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 review&lt;/a&gt; found that people with acne tend to have lower zinc levels than people without it. Researchers also found that zinc can help quell your breakouts, leaving you with fewer zits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;d3sign - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chronic disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinc deficiency has been linked to several other health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a22801286/pneumonia-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pneumonia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, per the NIH. Since zinc supports your immune system, being low on it can make you more susceptible to illness. Zinc deficiency can also make it harder for your body to fight inflammation and cell damage from free radicals—both of which have been tied to chronic disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X23001529" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ananda Prasad, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ananda Prasad, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, doctor and zinc deficiency specialist, previously told Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;svetikd - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vision loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your eyes, especially your retinas, contain a lot of zinc. But as you get older, those zinc levels start to decline—and as they do, you may develop age-related macular degeneration, per a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148351" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2019 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; and the NIH. The good news? Research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a46446375/best-time-to-take-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc supplementation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc supplementation&lt;/a&gt; can help you stave off vision loss. Just be sure to talk to your doctor. (Getting too much zinc has downsides too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PixelsEffect - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loss of taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If food doesn’t taste quite the same as it used to, you may be running low on zinc. The nutrient is involved in some of your most basic senses, per the NIH. And not getting enough can impact your ability to smell and taste things—sometimes causing you to lose taste or smell altogether, per a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29260510/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trouble hearing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running low on zinc can mess with your hearing in a couple different ways. Studies suggest that zinc deficiency may cause &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X23014900" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hearing loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019607091400283X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tinnitus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;—a persistent ringing or buzzing sound in your ear. What’s more? The lower your zinc levels, the louder and more severe that buzzing sound is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Johner Images - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stunted growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major sign of zinc deficiency—especially among infants, children, and adolescents—is stunted growth, per the NIH. Zinc is essential for healthy growth because of its influence on cell development, Dr. Prasad previously explained. A lack of it can slow down growth and development. And deficiency-related symptoms, like loss of appetite and diarrhea, can compound the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Alissa Hrustic and Kasandra Brabaw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PhotoAlto/Sigrid Olsson - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 20:29:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1RbGFXU3VNWUtfOUk1ZkdUTFFrS285VzJHZGxrUUJPZmpOS2Z1ZENQaFlIVHN6YXJQTW9qVFVrbXJVa3JYaTJueU9CNWJ1c0R5Q3BLRC0xMmVmYXBFMkpacEFxOUx5dmhx</guid></item><item><title>第一张Ozempic的脸。现在人们正在处理Ozempic头发和肌肉损失- Vogue | First Came Ozempic Face.

Many have experienced the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-ozempic-face" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;, which experts describe as rapid weight loss in the face and loss of skin elasticity, resulting in a significantly older appearance. “Ozempic face can look gaunt, deflated, and saggy,” New York facial plastic surgeon &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/drjenniferlevine/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/drjenniferlevine/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/drjenniferlevine/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Levine&lt;/a&gt; once told &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-ozempic-face"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Think raisin as opposed to grape!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now people are noticing that Ozempic and similar GLP-1 drugs (Mounjaro, Wegovy, Rybelsus, and Zepbound, to name a few) are affecting their hairlines and possibly weakening their muscle strength.

(It’s akin to the dramatic hair shedding some saw in the months post-COVID-19.) “People on GLP-1s may not actually notice hair shedding or thinning for several months after they are on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for muscle loss, that’s just a general side effect of losing weight, regardless of whether the impetus is diet, exercise, surgery, or a medication like Ozempic. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1104010511" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Holly Lofton&lt;/a&gt;, MD, director of the medical weight-management program at NYU Langone Health, tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt; that experts are seeing medications like Wegovy and Zepbound causing the same amount of muscle loss as one might experience through more traditional weight-loss methods—and sometimes more. Studies show that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036397/"&gt;25 to 30% of the total weight loss&lt;/a&gt; caused by calorie restriction and exercise comes from lean body mass, which includes muscles. So if someone were to lose 20 pounds, she says, around five to six pounds of that might be muscle that is lost. Studies on medications like Wegovy and Zepbound show patients can lose roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861994/"&gt;15 to 22% of their total weight&lt;/a&gt;, with about 25% of that weight loss being lean muscle mass. “These drugs are not necessarily muscle sparing,” she says. “However, because people tend to lose more total weight on these medications, the absolute amount of muscle loss can be greater, unless we intervene with resistance training and adequate protein intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can do to treat hair and muscle loss that you might experience when on these medications. Dr. Garshick notes that it is normal to shed approximately 50 to 100 hairs per day, so you should only be concerned if you notice significantly more hair falling out or if your hair loss persists for longer than three to six months. If that is the case, she recommends consulting a board-certified dermatologist for a proper evaluation. “Since telogen effluvium is considered a temporary process, once the weight stabilizes, it is possible the hair loss will slow down and hair regrowth will resume and normalize even without doing any specific intervention,” she says. “While this process can take 6 to 12 months, providing reassurance that it can get better on its own is often sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advises getting blood work done to see if there are hormonal changes or nutritional deficiencies that can be addressed through diet (making sure you are consuming enough protein is key) or the use of oral supplements like Nutrafol or Wellbel. You can also turn to thickening and volumizing shampoos, like the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/hair-fall-defense-shampoo-pimprod2046063" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FzrGcxRntjxTCUv9W25qpyQoDAqac26uX4LfuSRwhs9Pd2enkszF54LY2o6ADG7xxcm6SWvrW9Vee6FtVeK1sypDVZboeCvcYqLWPn6ezRsbbXChGh2TvQpWBvpkVyxc9xJzWjCvx8g4tm6h8pq2qkDnS3PHry45r5hwU77U9ibA"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FzrGcxRntjxTCUv9W25qpyQoDAqac26uX4LfuSRwhs9Pd2enkszF54LY2o6ADG7xxcm6SWvrW9Vee6FtVeK1sypDVZboeCvcYqLWPn6ezRsbbXChGh2TvQpWBvpkVyxc9xJzWjCvx8g4tm6h8pq2qkDnS3PHry45r5hwU77U9ibA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nioxin Hair Fall Defense Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/vegamour-gro-revitalizing-shampoo-for-thinning-hair-P473003" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gVLYTFHP77FHrV3N7q97uEuuwba6T4FNPoCDtWKSe5BHZ5L5anFAhpi4j8KoJSMzhcP7bXCZYh3fyknwbTB7ckDZxYTJ4yKovny43JQcUN6gcUT3YPEFK2Qnn8CwFUpw6jmcV8xop4aqs3ybNd79h2N23fAvoNFgQUNdAPk1AV1Cb7CDfUAbzXttTSMn47t532cjnGzvuhT1m5vnDW"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gVLYTFHP77FHrV3N7q97uEuuwba6T4FNPoCDtWKSe5BHZ5L5anFAhpi4j8KoJSMzhcP7bXCZYh3fyknwbTB7ckDZxYTJ4yKovny43JQcUN6gcUT3YPEFK2Qnn8CwFUpw6jmcV8xop4aqs3ybNd79h2N23fAvoNFgQUNdAPk1AV1Cb7CDfUAbzXttTSMn47t532cjnGzvuhT1m5vnDW" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vegamour Gro Revitalizing Shampoo&lt;/a&gt;, and leave-in products like the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Flourish-Density-Booster-Thinning-Treatment/dp/B09JVKY4CX" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/d5Zy5wnNZ5WxssT4g4qyMB2PYk3sF7NqDjbJ6LUDWfTnrZ2e2AxJdXsiMLpS42URje6RMkPNUfctHodmmqSWtDTLT9awnLuqCVnZi7UTyxKFWFxWmkpRV74VGTCYFkL8PCF2f5EQpoTFejV21cCvHxp8UCgWDoAJceo5bi4UewTcc3mYBPPsPdrHkoaM1Hf3NaL"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/d5Zy5wnNZ5WxssT4g4qyMB2PYk3sF7NqDjbJ6LUDWfTnrZ2e2AxJdXsiMLpS42URje6RMkPNUfctHodmmqSWtDTLT9awnLuqCVnZi7UTyxKFWFxWmkpRV74VGTCYFkL8PCF2f5EQpoTFejV21cCvHxp8UCgWDoAJceo5bi4UewTcc3mYBPPsPdrHkoaM1Hf3NaL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B09JVKY4CX" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Virtue Flourish Density Booster&lt;/a&gt; to help increase hair density.

Also, because we have to know what tests and check ups you will need.

Here's some real advice: do not let yourself grow old and obese. I will forgo any talk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes; that's inside stuff and while I'm well educated on it, I want to talk of the outside stuff that will make your life miserable. I'm talking arthritis, skin breakdown, lack of hygiene and the depression that goes along with it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The arthritis starts because your bone structure is in no way designed to carry 3 to 4 times the normal body weight. The joints wear down, the bone spurs develop, the spinal stenosis kicks in, and you find that every movement is an orchestra of multiple different minor but irritating pains all shooting off at once. You can't get out of bed or up from a chair without several body parts giving out little screams of pain. You will get used to it, but you will not like it. And you will start moving less and less; you'll start weighing the decision to get up and go do some social activity versus the pain it will cause you and at some point, the pain wins out and you start going out less and less. In the most extreme cases you will start to alter how to go the bathroom or clean yourself because a trip to the toilet and all the maneuvering it takes will just be too much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you start to move less and less, you start to clean yourself less and less, and the skin excoriation and fungal infections start to form in your various folds and crevices. You also have trouble fully wiping after a bowel movement, or you spill a little on yourself as you've adapted to using urinals instead of the toilet. Eventually your lack of movement and inability to clean yourself and exposure to bodily fluids leads to various ulcers that are painful and take a long time to heal. In the worst cases you can get a pressure ulcer that doesn't go away, is constantly exposed to fecal material, an infection starts and you eventually go septic and end up in the ICU. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So with this lack of movement and ability to fully clean self comes the obvious result of just smelling bad. I'm not trying to be an a*****e here, but the lack of hygiene will cause friends and family to avoid coming over, or going places with you, or just having any social contact beyond a phone call. The isolation will escalate, the depression will increase, your world becomes smaller and smaller and you just hate yourself for the trap you're in. It sucks but other people can only take so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on top of it all, even at rest, you won't be comfortable. You can't breath properly when sleeping so you get a cpap at home, and while that takes care of properly oxygenating yourself while at rest, the aching joints and muscle spasms will prevent you from ever having a satisfying sleep again. You will always be tired, this just exacerbates all the problems I just mentioned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the end, severe depression. Severe self hate. Feeling trapped in a body that's become a prison and at your age there's no way out. You're isolated, you're alone, and the friends and family you do have avoid visiting. When they do come around, you have to either ask them for help with all the things you've neglected to do because you physically can't (which they start to see coming, so they up and leave or just don't come by at all), or you just sit their and have a sad conversation that dances around the elephant in the room that is what's become of your life. It's sad, just all around sad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I didn't write this to be an a*****e, I wrote it because I see these types of people in the hospital and in home care regularly. In America the obesity epidemic is so prevalent, and it affects every aspect of a persons life. Obesity is a prison cell in and of itself. Now as an RN and as a human being, I'm not trying to judge you for why it happened, it is what it is, but please if you are seriously overweight or obese, now is the day to start doing something about it. Do not wait any longer. Do not hope for a magic cure. Do not deny what is happening. Make the changes, you are worth it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et64lj8/" target="_blank"&gt; 6202019 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kind-elderly-woman-eating-pie-from-the-plate-with-appetite-while-sitting-on-the-bench-near-the-country-house-stock-photo-p0nk21q--Nk" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-33/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057938"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057938" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-27-6880cb862083b-png__700.jpg" alt="Elderly hand showing signs of aging on a white fabric surface, highlighting doctors' insights on death machines." title="Elderly hand showing signs of aging on a white fabric surface, highlighting doctors' insights on death machines."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Actually a doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish people would know that when I say, "I don't think CPR is in your/your relatives' best interests", I am not saying I am going to withdraw all treatment immediately. CPR is BRUTAL, and it has a much lower success rate (even if done promptly in hospital) than the movies make out. If you are old, or have a lot of medical problems, then the success rate goes down even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't want to do CPR on you it's not because I want you to die, it's because I don't want to fracture your ribs, expose your body to a huge group of people you don't know (everyone loves attending a crash call), and repeatedly a*****t your dead body for nothing. I want you to die with dignity and care if there is no chance of bringing you back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, CPR is great and everyone should learn how to do it, it does save lives. But, if a doctor suggests it should not be performed, please give serious thought to that. We don't suggest a DNACPR for no reason.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5xqmb/" target="_blank"&gt; Persephone_88 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/persons-left-hand-on-white-textile-1sRJgrV4nwI" target="_blank"&gt; Bruce Tang / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to live a long, happy, and healthy life is to take such good care of yourself that you preemptively avoid (some) &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/infuriated-by-doctors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; before they arise.

And some habits take far longer to form than others. It depends on the activity itself, your character, and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to sports medicine psychologist Matthew Sacco, PhD, simpler habits are easier to form. “Something that you can do pretty frequently can get established quickly—in 18 days or so,” Sacco &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-form-a-habit-11716094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Verywell Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, complex activities take far longer to become automatic parts of our daily lives. “Something complex like exercise can take six-plus months to make it a really well-established habit.” That being said, the “minimum requirement to establish an exercise habit” is at least 6 weeks of exercising 4 times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that you engage in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, as well as 2 days of muscle-strengthening activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057988"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057988" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm a nurse not a doctor but... All these fad diets that claim to "detoxify" you are nonsense. Your liver and kidneys are the only way you're getting detoxified, not some MLM magic vitamin pill that your co-worker sells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quit asking for antibiotics when you have a virus. It's literally doing nothing for you, except killing the good bacteria in your body, and it's creating super bacteria. Doctors, quit prescribing antibiotics when you know it's a virus because you just don't feel like arguing with Karen. I've seen this way too many times. "Karen" brings her kid with the sniffles to the ER and demands antibiotics. Doc prescribes them to shut Karen up and get her brat out of the ER. Stop it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccines aren't some big pharma conspiracy. They work. Big pharma is gonna f**k you by price gouging you, not in some crazy conspiracy to poison you. The amount of aluminium in a typical vaccine is a smaller amount than you consume in your everyday diet. There is no Mercury in children's vaccines. The mercury that's in multi-dose adult vaccines is not the same as the mercury that was in old thermometers. Many facilities ,such as mine, don't even use multi dose vials. Just because a chemical compound sounds scary doesn't mean it is scary. The vaccine schedule for children is fine. Not getting your kid the chicken pox vaccine is setting your kid up for shingles when they get older and that s**t is not fun. I get it, you had chicken pox when you were younger and you are ok. I hope you don't get shingles cause you are gonna regret having chicken pox. The pain from shingles is no joke.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5xrnr/" target="_blank"&gt; Red142 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-78/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057942"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057942" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a Dr. But l do have some advice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're ever short of breath and it's unexplained ( not running while being a fat smoker like me)&lt;br&gt;GO SEE A DR. NOW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For about 4 days prior to this past Christmas (2018) my wife (f29) was short of breath and felt generally crummy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We didn't think it was anything but a cold/allergies etc. &lt;br&gt;Christmas day she felt worse, didn't move much. So I told her that if she doesn't show improvement by the next morning (12/26/18, yes the dates are important, you'll see why)&lt;br&gt;That I would be forcing her to go to the ER and get checked out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She didn't have any improvement. Only worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took her to the ER around 4pm that day. When they took her back and got her hooked up she was at 40-45% O2 saturation. Which is bad. She was then sent by ambulance to the nearest hospital with an ICU. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For any Dr's in the house, there was about a golf ball size part of her lungs that showed black on the x-ray, the rest was white........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 10pm that day she had dropped to 10-15% o2 saturation and was immediately put on a ventilator and was kept asleep for 2 weeks. She was, at most, a few hours from dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She had pneumonia and sepsis in both lungs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the amount of meds they gave her, and being dehydrated already her kidneys took a hard hit. She had dialysis 6 times in the hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 37 days in the hospital, 14 of which she was in and out of consciousness, she remembers not being able to talk and trying to write some stuff on a paper, she was released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week (July 1st ish) we got blood work back that her kidneys were finally back to 99.6% function.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5rslc/" target="_blank"&gt; Goodwynn89 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of these medical professionals’ insights surprised you the most?

I can only see patients record if they were in my hospital or in the neighbouring hospital otherwise i have to call their family doc, who may or may not be at all times available.

I understand that ritualistic consumption of the poison has been part of almost every society for thousands of years, but that absolutley does not change just how terrible it is for your body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may think, "I binge drink all the time and I'm fine! I come from a long line of heavy drinkers! It's just some booze, I've never gotten sick from it!" But BOY HOWDY do you not realize what it does to your body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By binge drinking, you run the risk of developing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stomach bleeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intestinal bleeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pancreatitis (both acute and chronic).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liver disease and/or liver failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcoholism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heart failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seizures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stroke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Osteoporosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lung failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The list goes on... Every time you have more than a few drinks in a night, you are essentially juggling hand grenades hoping that they don't go off. There is just no reason to do that to your body. Having 4 drinks spread out over a few hours can be JUST as fun as having 10 drinks in the same time span, AND you're not putting yourself at risk for massive organ failure and making yourself look like an idiot. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5th67/" target="_blank"&gt; Mosessbro &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-people-sitting-around-each-other-r9hE0Fk6Ock" target="_blank"&gt; A F / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-35/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057915"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057915" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-3-6880a5ca7d888-png__700.jpg" alt="Person wrapping hand with medical bandage, highlighting doctors' warnings about death machines and health risks." title="Person wrapping hand with medical bandage, highlighting doctors' warnings about death machines and health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Don’t do DIY surgery or hold off on reporting things that are obvious warning signs.

Feed your d**n baby!!! The badge of honor you get for exclusively breastfeeding isn’t real. Dehydration, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, these are all real and happen all the time. Feed your baby!! Lots of hospitals will even let you use donor breast milk initially if you’re strongly opposed to formula. Just feed your baby. And don’t use a cup or a spoon. The lactation consultants will tell you that babies know how to lap it up. Well, you didn’t give birth to a kitten. If your baby has an intact suck reflex you should use it. It allows the gag reflex to work better. If you feel strongly about the concept of n****e confusion (it’s not a thing) then ask for a SNS System. Tape that tiny tube to a b**b and let your kid eat that way. Just feed your baby. Also, this nonsense about how a baby only needs a few drops of milk in the beginning because their stomach is only the size of a walnut. True, their stomach is small. But much like most other stomachs it stretches and empties pretty readily into the small intestine. Plenty of babies eat a full ounce right out the gate. Errrr, vag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, if you have a home birth and your kid ends up coming to the hospital by EMS please let us do our job. If you don’t want any of the care we offer then please refuse EMS. Or don’t even call them to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited: but wait there’s more. I don’t give a s**t if you don’t want hepatitis B vaccine at delivery, you can take that up with your pediatrician. I don’t really care about erythromycin either, unless you’re unclean. But vitamin K. Don’t skip that. It prevents bleeding. It’s a big deal. Babies don’t make their own vitamin K until their gut has sufficient substrate and time to. It’s a key part of the clotting cascade. If it were well absorbed orally we would give it that way, we’re not sadistic pricks that like to give shots to newborn babies for grins. We give it that way because it actually works that way.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et6h6m6/" target="_blank"&gt; tobmom &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9058001"&gt;  &lt;p id="9058001" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-13-6880c14602456-png__700.jpg" alt="Man with tattoos covering face with arms, lying in bed looking exhausted, illustrating doctors' warnings on health risks." title="Man with tattoos covering face with arms, lying in bed looking exhausted, illustrating doctors' warnings on health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;If there could be a public service announcement about how utterly miserable it is to die by paracetomol o******e, that would great.

Don't be embarrassed by your body. Having said that, if you are concerned about anything, ask your doctor. We have generally heard it all before, and trust me, we have (nearly always) seen it all before. Maybe you have something that has been bothering you for ages, but you were too scared or embarrassed to ask about it ... Just ask! It might be 'nothing' and you have been stressing about it for no reason. And if not, then you are at least one step closer to getting it fixed. No one can help if they don't know. There are no stupid questions, so ask away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm always amazed when I have been asked about something that has been bothering a patient for years and years, but they were too embarrassed / scared to bring it up. Most of the time, it is nothing / a completely normal body function / feature. Other times, it is something that should have been discussed right away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOU know your body best. So speak up! Don't wait for the doctor to "ask the right question".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5ud4j/" target="_blank"&gt; frangipani_c &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-sitting-at-a-desk-in-front-of-another-man-nAcqvTvOgi4" target="_blank"&gt; Yunus Tuğ / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-29/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9058068"&gt;  &lt;p id="9058068" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-15-6880c2725c1bd-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a dentist using a dental mirror to examine the mouth of a patient at a medical clinic." title="Close-up of a dentist using a dental mirror to examine the mouth of a patient at a medical clinic."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Teeth are the most disrespected body part.

It’s shocking how many people don’t know the anatomy of women. The urethra is where your pee comes from. It is also where bacteria can enter and cause a UTI. No a UTI is not a STD. And it isn’t in your v****a. It’s in your urinary tract. Yes you need to go see a doctor because that infection can travel all the way up to your kidneys and eventually into your bloodstream and you will end up septic. &lt;br&gt;Also a yeast infection is not the same thing. Often you get them after a dose of antibiotics that caused an overgrowth of yeast in the v****a. And husbands/boyfriends, familiarize yourself so you can be understanding. She is not gross. She could have some anatomical problems and chronic UTIs. It can happen to you too. You just got blessed with a urethra that has a longer distance from the entrance to the bladder.

Just one example - antioxidants are like gas for your car. You can store up a certain amount of vitamins, but your tank can only hold so much. If you binge and overfill your tank, it doesn't do anything (you excrete it out as waste), and you can't expect to go the next several months without gas just because you tried to overload it before. You're going to still need to get gas. Same goes for your fruits and veggies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had someone tell me he went vegetarian for a few weeks, which meant he was done for the year.

Prevention is becoming more and more important in medicine, and treating a disease in its early stages is a lot better than catching it late. If you have family members who had ovarian or colon cancer in their 30s, that is very significant for your own risk. The screening and tests we run might change, depending. If you want to start the pill, it's important to know about breast cancer, DVTs, clotting disorders in the family. If you're a bit overweight and have no metabolic syndrome problems in the family, compared to a bit overweight but both your parents have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the management priorities change. Asking your family about any recurring diseases or diseases that occurred early (20s, 30s, maybe 40s) can be helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are certain common conditions that are underdiagnosed but easily fixed. Even if you have non-specific symptoms, it doesn't hurt to tell your doctor during the next visit. About 5% of US adults have an iron deficiency which can cause loss of concentration and fatigue, and a huge amount are vitamin D deficient. When I am able to complete a systems review (ask screening questions about every different body system) I end up discovering a lot of irritable bowel syndrome, hypothyroidism, insomnia, joint pain, headaches, etc that impact quality of life. But people don't bring it up because they don't want to be a bother, or think the symptoms are too vague. It's not a bother, and often (but not always) these conditions have simple treatments which can really improve how you feel.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5ob1y/" target="_blank"&gt; manlikerealities &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-people-standing-on-top-of-a-lush-green-field-8zuLH8v8OKo" target="_blank"&gt; Giulia Squillace / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057974"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057974" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The frequency of bowel movements can range from every 3 days to 3 times per day and be considered normal.

Some pearls I've picked up:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# The colon is in general air-tight. Therefore your d***o ALWAYS needs a flared base. Once it gets up past the point that I can grab it out, it's vacuum sealed in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# If you don't smoke cigarettes, if you wear your seatbelt, and if you don't drink and drive, you've just greatly increased your chances of avoiding a tragic end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# No one really knows when they're going to die. With that in mind, have a plan. Talk to your family about your end-of-life care wishes. I had a 90 year old the other day with terminal cancer and 6 kids and they had evidently never thought their mom was going to die. Are you sure she would really want "everything"? Intubation, CPR (bye bye, sternum), central line (giant iv in the neck)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# A child's fever is in the overwhelming majority of cases a healthy response to an infection. It wouldn't be unusual to expect 6 fevers a year during the toddler years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# The body is astoundingly complex and what counts as "disease" vs that which is a normal and a temporary aberration from the mean is a philosophically rich and unanswered question. Therefore, no amount of testing may ever reveal what is "wrong", which begs the question as to whether anything is actually wrong. All pathology reveals itself with enough time. A twinge here, 2 sneezes, a faint discoloration of the skin. Sometimes these are best left unexplained and you can save yourself the ambulance ride.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5uhvx/" target="_blank"&gt; dryyyyyycracker &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-69/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057972"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057972" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Take care of your feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can't feel your feet, check your feet regularly to make sure they're clean, dry, and haven't started developing any sores.

Just like how you won’t notice a missed oil change a couple thousand miles later. But diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, alcohol dependence, etc, they all sneak up on you. Just like how eventually, that engine won’t run as smooth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second thing is that your body isn’t like a TV remote, where you pop out the old batteries and put in some new ones. You can’t expect to come into a hospital and walk out feeling 100%. People have some unrealistic expectations of what doctors can do, and there is research which demonstrates how TV shows provide the public with these false beliefs (I’m a Grey’s fan also, but it’s not real medicine). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first line treatment for most of our common diseases is...wait for it... lifestyle modification. It’s not d***s. It’s not surgery. 50% of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics do not require anything more than diet and exercise. Cessation of smoking is the second best thing you can do for your health, and every little amount you decrease smoking has a profound impact. Again, you won’t see it now, but you’ll see it down the road (like the oil change). And if you do need meds (like how most will eventually need meds for their blood pressure), don’t play around with it. Take it every day. Hypertension is called the silent k**ler. You can’t really feel your blood pressure. But it’s slowly damaging every artery and every organ in your body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that comes down to the last point. Exercising is the key to a better life. If you put in the work, there is no upper limit. That’s not an exaggeration, but the findings of a landmark paper that made news everywhere last October. Not exercising is worse than smoking, diabetes, or coronary artery disease. It is the single best thing you can do for a healthier life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your health is a shared responsibility, and we’re here to help. This may not be the flashiest Reddit comment. But this one may actually save your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;——-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: so I’m getting a lot of great questions on what are good exercises and how long should you be exercising. This is probably the single most asked question I get from my parents friends and random strangers. Unfortunately it’s a bit complicated. I could go on quoting tons of papers from a variety of sources, but that would be difficulty to parse though. An exercise regimen should ideally be set by at a medical professional specifically for you. It may vary based on your age, occupation, underlying health conditions, fitness goals, etc. I couldn’t give a 60 year old with COPD the same instructions as a 25 year old. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t want to say something in a reddit comment that would end up hurting you or your loved one, so I won’t go into specifics. The generic advice we give to our older patients is to “walk at a brisk pace, enough for a mild sweat”. There is some evidence to show that even normal walking can significantly help improve your cardiac health. I’m only focusing on cardiovascular health here, and there are other things to consider with exercise. I don’t want to sound annoying, but I really feel it’s best you talk to your doctor about what else you can do to improve your health. We’d be glad to walk you though a plan made specifically for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, regarding number of steps per day. The 10,000 steps number is unscientific and largely propagated by the pedometer making industry. First it should be age adjusted. It also doesn’t directly correlate with losing weight. However, personally, as someone approaching 30, I do like 10,000. It’s a nice clean number and I can make a game out of it for myself. It is important to note that this is not for everyone.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5psel/" target="_blank"&gt; z3roTO60 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-woman-in-a-white-lab-coat-is-listening-to-a-woman-in-a-white-coat-E3nAJw_GHqQ" target="_blank"&gt; Pablo Merchán Montes / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-full-list-block "&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note: this post originally had &lt;a class="open-list-full-list-link" href="https://www.boredpanda.com/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew/?all_submissions=true&amp;amp;media_id=9057921"&gt;76 images&lt;/a&gt;.

And, there are other nuances to consider when it comes to striking the right protein balance, like whether someone has pre-existing health conditions and/or how active they are. Plus, it's important to consider what qualifies as a “high-protein” diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we talked to experts to separate fact from fiction when it comes to high-protein diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein do you need per day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended daily allowance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommended daily allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram per day for people age 18 and up. That ends up translating to about 55 grams of protein per day for a 150-pound person, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the RDA for protein hasn’t changed in decades, and there is some debate on whether it should be higher, especially in people who are active. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/#how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Some experts say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Some experts say&lt;/a&gt; up to two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is a better goal for certain groups. That would be as much as 136 grams of protein per day for that same 150-pound person.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most things in nutrition, though, how much protein you need per day is personal, and best discussed with your doctor or a registered dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are high-protein diets dangerous?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common—but unproven or very dependent on context—claims about high-protein diets or protein supplementation include that too much protein could cause fat gain, kidney problems, or even raise the risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these ideas are out there, a lot of the concerns around high-protein diets either haven’t been directly proven or stem from people who have underlying health conditions, points out &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t found any evidence that high-protein diets are harmful for most people,” Dr. Ali says. “People with certain medical conditions—patients with kidney issues or problems metabolizing protein—have to be more careful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669325/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; suggested that high-protein diets may be hard on your kidneys, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions. But this is “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1408424/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggestive data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suggestive data&lt;/a&gt;” as one scientific analysis points out. Meaning, researchers haven’t proven that a high-protein diet leads to kidney issues, and in fact, this specific analysis found the opposite—higher protein diets (especially if they're plant-based) were associated with a lower risk of chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Johnson says that not all high-protein diets are created equal. “High-protein diets can vary significantly based on the sources of protein consumed,” she says. People who eat high-protein diets rich in saturated fat have a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:greater risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;greater risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiovascular disease than those who have a high-protein diet with less saturated fat, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a red meat-rich high-protein diet also carries risks: “Although not solely attributed to high protein intake, excessive consumption of red meat has been consistently associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer,” Johnson says. But, she says, people who eat a lot of red meat aren’t necessarily on a high-protein diet—and you can be on a high-protein diet without eating red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for claims that too much protein will make you gain fat, Dr. Ali says it’s possible, but unlikely. “If you’re having so much protein that you’re getting in more calories than your body needs, you can gain weight,” he says. But given that protein is filling, Dr. Ali says it’s “hard to overdo it” with this macronutrient. “It’s harder to have more than your body needs with protein than with carbohydrates,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to calculate a safe upper limit for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there’s still a lot that scientists are figuring out in relation to high-protein diets, but there is some guidance. The RDA cited above is the minimum amount most generally healthy people need to hit to avoid having health issues, Johnson notes. So, you can probably have more than that with no issue, provided you don’t have any underlying health conditions. But it’s always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before making any diet changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For generally healthy individuals, protein intake of up to two grams per kilogram of body weight—approximately one gram per pound—is typically considered safe,” Johnson says. “At this level, the kidneys are generally able to manage the nitrogen load associated with protein metabolism without strain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else should you keep in mind about high-protein diets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While protein has a lot going for it, Johnson says it’s still important to focus on getting the other macronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When protein intake is significantly increased, intake of carbohydrates and fats decreases,” she says. “Carbohydrate-rich foods provide a wide variety of essential nutrients not commonly found in high-protein foods. As a result, individuals following a very high-protein, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat diet may be at risk of inadequate nutrient intake, which can lead to negative health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having too little fiber is also a concern with high-protein diets, Johnson says. That can raise the risk of digestive issues, along with deficiencies in vitamins and minerals like B vitamins, vitamins C and E, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Dr. Ali says a high-protein diet is generally safe for most people. If you’re interested in ramping up your protein intake, Johnson recommends checking in with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure there are no potential issues, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 19:30:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE4yQ2VYdkJhX2k2TExTTTNFeDFHUk56ZXM1TkM5ZkNaVWtWYXBORXZ2MFItREVRYTJLOW5BbXRoV1dVTjhabXRjYlBsTTAxVXUwMVJidHd0SWg1dDRaMGljdGFtemdhUl9kSVZkcllyY2Y</guid></item><item><title>您锌含量低的1号迹象-预防 | The Number-1 Sign You’re Low on Zinc - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZDlWY2pzcl9ZOGNHNGhvR2NpZ3h6YXVOQjgxSUlQVEM2Q190XzBUSHJON3JNcm9qUGppNmZWVFZhdzlLM2dDOVFXNWJlaXNCUzBqbWZNX1hmZFZ3WnB2NGdIRlRLVnl3bmlQWndOc1BYUDBGeHhzb1plV2dKalQ1TlA1aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;main id="main-content" class="css-rk6tbh ewq0ot92"&gt;&lt;p id="gpt-leaderboard-ad" suppresshydrationwarning class="css-1rauiqq ewg5wdb1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="listicle" data-journey-hide="true" class="listicle-container content-container listicle-body-content css-4rmlxi e13lia4i20"&gt;&lt;section data-ad-index="0" class="css-t6ry6e e13lia4i18"&gt;&lt;section id="slide-1" data-anchor-id="slide-1" data-journey-listicle-slide="true" class="css-1rz4ih8 e16kmapv11"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-inner-container" data-journey-content="true" class="listicle-slides css-13j5f4r e16kmapv10"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-inner-container" class="css-1l3nada e16kmapv9"&gt;&lt;h2 data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-title" class="css-1vi44h6 e16kmapv8"&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="css-1gomreu e16kmapv0"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-image" class="css-1vei6hc eutn2uj2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-7jdyxr e1nfup6f1"&gt;&lt;img srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=480:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=980:* 980w" alt="woman sitting with ice pack on knee" data-cy="slide-image-1" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=980:*" title="Woman sitting with ice pack on knee" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v2"&gt;PhotoAlto/Odilon Dimier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-tjljl5 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-meta" class="css-18oiw2p e16kmapv6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-hru0c2 e16kmapv7"&gt;&lt;p class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Zinc deficiency symptoms can range a lot, depending on your age.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 may lead to chronic health impacts that, in some cases, may become apparent only years later, according to new research in nonhuman primates led by Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012988" rel="" target="_blank" title=""&gt;published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, raises the possibility that long-COVID may be far more common than currently estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More articles and photos in a &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/news-media/oregon-national-primate-research-center-advances-human-health"&gt;media kit&lt;/a&gt; about the Oregon National Primate Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long COVID is generally defined as a chronic illness with a range of symptoms or conditions that can last weeks, months or even years after the initial illness. Its prevalence can be hard to determine because the symptoms are largely self-reported, but researchers have reported it affects as many as one in 10 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new close examination of infected nonhuman primates suggests that figure may be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined both tissues and blood biomarkers in a group of rhesus macaques exposed to the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged relatively early in the pandemic at a point when many people had yet to be vaccinated or naturally exposed. Researchers monitored the macaques over six months and found persistent parameters of disease in 60% to 90% of the animals, even though the overt symptoms appeared relatively mild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the findings may be validating for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It may give affirmation to a lot of people who experience lingering symptoms that are being dismissed or they try to ignore,” said lead author &lt;strong&gt;Kristin Sauter, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, research assistant professor at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center. “This may provide proof that long COVID is affecting a lot more people than we think.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found evidence for lung pathology, sleep disturbance and changes in blood biomarkers that predict the risk for cardiometabolic conditions such as hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance. The animals were studied for six months, but these findings suggest the potential for diseases to develop months or years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say the findings should raise awareness among clinicians and patients alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next stage of research, the team intends to test early interventions in nonhuman primates, an area of research that could be especially relevant for people with underlying metabolic conditions such as obesity or even prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re proposing a study to see if we can mitigate some of the metabolic changes we see following infection,” said senior author &lt;strong&gt;Charles Roberts, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, professor and senior adviser at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. “We intend to look at potential interventions to institute at the time of infection for at-risk populations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists generally recognize COVID-19 has more severe effects on people with underlying medical conditions. Conversely, the new research set out to examine why a SARS-CoV-2 infection may put people at higher risk of developing obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study compared the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in two groups of macaques, nine that were overweight and 10 that were lean and metabolically healthy. Researchers found different long-term consequences in each group; however, the lean animals did not avoid health impacts from exposure to the delta variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even if you started off lean and healthy, this study shows it won’t protect you from some of the worst consequences of COVID,” Roberts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases award 3R01DK122843, as part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NIH’s Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or RECOVER Initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which seeks to understand the long-term effects of COVID and improve long COVID care.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All research involving animal subjects at OHSU must be reviewed and approved by the university’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/research-integrity/institutional-animal-care-and-use-committee-iacuc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(IACUC). The IACUC’s priority is to ensure the health and safety of animal research subjects. The IACUC also reviews procedures to ensure the health and safety of the people who work with the animals. The IACUC conducts a rigorous review of all animal research proposals to ensure they demonstrate scientific value and justify the use of live animals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2025.102625" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Environmental Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that different types of green environments may shape children’s mental health and thinking skills in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities offer many conveniences, but they often come at the cost of reduced natural surroundings. Past studies have shown that access to parks, trees, and other green spaces can benefit children’s mental health and cognitive abilities. However, it has remained unclear exactly how green space exposure affects the developing brain, particularly during the sensitive period of late childhood and early adolescence. The new study aimed to shed light on this question by linking various indicators of green space to brain imaging data, mental health measures, and cognitive test scores from thousands of children across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which includes neuroimaging and behavioral information from more than 11,000 children aged 9 to 10. For this particular analysis, the researchers focused on two groups: 8,430 children with complete brain structure data and 8,161 with detailed white matter imaging. To ensure accurate measurement of environmental exposure, they excluded children who had moved recently and those with missing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture children’s level of exposure to green space, the researchers used nine indicators derived from national land-use and vegetation databases. These included measures such as tree canopy, different types of forest cover, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a satellite-based estimate of greenery. These data were used to characterize the amount and type of vegetation surrounding each child’s home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain structure was measured using high-resolution MRI scans. The researchers examined several aspects of brain anatomy, including cortical thickness, surface area, subcortical volume, and overall cortical volume. White matter microstructure, which reflects the integrity of the brain’s communication pathways, was assessed using diffusion imaging techniques that measure how water moves through white matter tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify patterns linking green space exposure to brain features, the researchers applied a statistical method called Group Factor Analysis. This technique helps detect hidden relationships across large sets of variables—in this case, environmental data and neuroimaging metrics. The resulting factors were then used to predict children’s scores on standardized mental health and cognitive tests, while adjusting for other influences such as household income and parental education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed several important findings. One of the strongest patterns to emerge—called BSGFA 1—showed that greater exposure to urban greenery, including tree canopy and mixed vegetation, was associated with larger surface area and volume in many parts of the brain. This included areas involved in visual processing and sensorimotor functions, such as the superior parietal lobule and fusiform gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with higher BSGFA 1 scores also had fewer emotional and behavioral problems, as rated by their parents, and scored higher on tests of crystallized intelligence, which reflects accumulated knowledge and language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key pattern, called WGFA 1, linked green space exposure to healthier white matter properties. Children with higher WGFA 1 scores had stronger white matter connectivity and lower levels of diffusion in their brain tissue, suggesting more efficient communication between brain regions. These children also showed fewer externalizing behaviors—such as impulsivity and aggression—and performed better on both fluid and crystallized intelligence tasks. Fluid intelligence, which involves reasoning and problem-solving, is thought to depend especially on white matter efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, not all green spaces were associated with positive outcomes. A different pattern, labeled WGFA 2, reflected greater exposure to forest-dense areas and showed a negative relationship with white matter health and fluid intelligence. This finding suggests that forest-heavy environments might offer fewer opportunities for visual, motor, and social engagement compared to more open or community-oriented green spaces like urban parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proposed several explanations for these effects. Natural environments may reduce stress and mental fatigue, which in turn promotes healthier brain development. This idea fits with existing theories like Attention Restoration Theory, which suggests that nature helps people recover from cognitive overload, and Stress Reduction Theory, which proposes that greenery elicits calming emotional responses. The study also expanded on these theories by showing that exposure to green environments might actually shape the physical structure of the brain during a key period of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results held up even after adjusting for neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and access to health resources. This means that the benefits linked to green space exposure could not be fully explained by broader advantages of living in wealthier or more resource-rich areas. However, some effects—particularly the relationship between greenery and crystallized intelligence—appeared to be partially influenced by these neighborhood conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had several strengths, including its large and diverse sample, use of advanced brain imaging, and integration of multiple environmental and biological indicators. It also revealed how different types of green environments may have different effects on the developing brain. For example, while general greenery like tree canopy and urban vegetation was consistently linked to positive outcomes, dense forest cover showed more mixed or even negative associations with brain connectivity and reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the study had limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it could not determine whether green space exposure directly caused changes in brain structure or behavior. Longitudinal and experimental studies will be needed to better establish causal relationships. The study also relied on satellite and census data to estimate environmental exposure, which may not capture the quality of green spaces or how often children actually used them. Future research could benefit from combining objective measures with personal reports of nature experiences and time spent outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2025.102625" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Associations Among green space exposure, brain, and mental health and cognition in the Adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jia Liu, Yumeng Yang, Tianjiao Kong, Ran Liu, and Liang Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 18:04:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNQkRiTEd1cDQ5dzJkeTJVQk0tcERKZTlLZzJNWXNMamVfM1hSSUM5ck5YR1FDaXdtRGJPeE9NVVlTRi1uOWNmTTJpU0luTTZMaHNWTUVDcGlUWDVMRWVYRXE5NG5jUWlWSW15d1dMUmdzeWhsUTRBMlNtT2FYUERRRFFmZDFHaGgxcEJYaHR2VU91bHNTSWdzaXI0cUNqa2k1dGEwbHB2c2h1TE1GMXB2WDF3</guid></item><item><title>论文|我患有晚期癌症。我就是这样把消息告诉孩子的。-《华尔街日报》 | Essay | I Have Terminal Cancer.

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your body's gut bacteria has its very own Ozempic-like system, a study suggests, and scientists believe manipulating it could ramp up &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-8d258550-68ae-11f0-aac4-475b2c965eca"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; without the drug's nasty side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Duke University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/north-carolina/index.html" id="mol-8d270bf0-68ae-11f0-aac4-475b2c965eca"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; have discovered specialized bacteria and cells in the colon that can send signals to the brain to control how much you eat and curb appetite, similarly to how weight-loss drugs work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the animal study, the scientists found that while eating, a gut bacteria known as flagella releases flagellin protein that then produces a hormone called PYY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the body feels full or has reached food satisfaction, the PYY hormone alerts the colon's neurobiotic sense, a direct communication channel between the gut and nervous system, to let the brain know to stop eating in real time and prevent a person from consuming excessive calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found that when this bacterial sensing system breaks down, people tend to eat more food and gain significantly more weight than people with a fully functioning system, which can lead to&lt;span&gt; obesity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, they concluded that this unique system naturally&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14908045/okra-natural-ozempic-obesity-diabetes-heart.html"&gt; mimics the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1 drugs &lt;/a&gt;in the body and can help control weight gain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also believe that manipulating the bacterial system and enhancing the natural communication, through certain diets or by taking prebiotics and probiotics, could help with weight loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Diego Bohórquez, an associate professor of medicine and neurobiology at the university, said: 'Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Duke University researchers have discovered colon bacteria and cells that mimic Ozempic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09301-7#Sec1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, tested the gut mechanism on two groups of mice: one which had the receptors for the PYY hormone in their gut, known as TLR5, and another that did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both groups of mice fasted overnight and were given a small dose of flagellin directly into the colon the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mice with TLR5 receptors in their gut ate less the next day, while those without consumed larger meals and gained more weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased food consumption was seen in both male and female mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the results are yet to be replicated in humans, the scientists concluded that the flagellin could trigger cells in the gut to send an appetite-suppressing signal to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, the key player in the system is flagellin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When excessive amounts of food are consumed, the gut bacteria releases high amounts of flagellin in the colon, which in turn sends more urgent signals to the brain to stop eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that without the TLR5 receptors and the gut's 'We've had enough' signal, the person continues to eat without realizing they are full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results indicated that the presence of TLR5 receptors in the gut's cells and the production of the PYY hormone act as the body's natural 'stop eating' signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say this system mimics the effects of GLP-1 drugs and can help control weight gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Flagella, a gut bacteria that releases the flagellin protein and releases PYY hormone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors wrote: 'It's similar to how we use our other senses – sight, sound, smell, taste and touch – to interpret our world. But this one operates from an unexpected place: The gut.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on these results, the scientists hope to further understand how the gut detects microbes and can influence everything from eating habits to mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) target brain chemistry and suppressing appetite, but they can also lead to long-term side effects and damage to vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and thyroid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the discovery of the gut's 'sixth sense' of food consumption, as well as the possibility to increase the presence of flagella through diet changes or supplements, can help people naturally lose weight without suffering the extreme side effects of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:55:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to experts writing in the Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology, &amp;amp; Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, this lack of documentation has resulted in a relatively basic understanding of the impact of menstrual cycles on health, as well as the underdiagnosis and neglect of concerns related to menstruation such as pain and heavy bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These menstrual cycle characteristics can be indicators for conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, information on a patient’s menstrual cycle is not routinely collected by healthcare professionals, unlike other measures such as BMI, blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than a quarter of women in England are living with a serious reproductive health issue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/10/one-in-four-women-england-reproductive-health-issue-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;largest survey of its kind&lt;/a&gt; published this year, with experts saying that “systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues” prevent women from accessing care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Almost a fifth (19%) of women who took part in the study experienced severe period pain in the last year, and 40% of respondents reported heavy menstrual bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/medical-misogyny-condemns-women-to-years-of-gynaecological-pain-mps-told" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report by the women and equalities parliamentary committee&lt;/a&gt; last year found that women and girls are enduring years of pain because their reproductive conditions are being dismissed due to “medical misogyny”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Serious conditions like fibroids and endometriosis can have a devastating impact on almost every aspect of a person’s life, including impacting their physical and mental health, and their ability to work and socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Too often systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues mean women do not get the care they deserve and our current system risks entrenching the health inequalities we can see in these findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="01c5c490-0a9b-4a0c-affc-2f04a8bf9758" data-spacefinder-role="richLink"

              &lt;p&gt;A 55-year-old man’s swollen toes and fingers turned out to have a much stranger explanation than expected. In a recent case report, the man’s doctors detailed how some of his bones were “completely replaced” by metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Australia &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/image-challenge?ci=20250710"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man visited the hospital after weeks of having pain and swelling in one finger and one toe. They soon discovered the symptoms were an unusual complication of the man’s earlier diagnosed metastatic squamous-cell lung cancer. Tragically, he soon died after.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man, as it turned out, had acrometastases—or cancers that had spread beyond his lungs to the bones past his elbows and knees. Acrometastases are incredibly rare, only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8471162/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to occur in 0.1% of cases where cancer spreads to the bones. Though they’re sometimes the first sign of a hidden late-stage cancer, they’re more often preceded by other noticeable symptoms, as in this case. The condition is typically caused by cancers of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract; it’s also more common in men.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man had experienced six weeks of painful swelling in his right middle finger and right big toe, along with an open wound under the toe’s fingernail. The swollen appendages were also firm and tender to touch. Acrometastases can superficially resemble gout or osteomyelitis, the report authors noted. But X-rays easily revealed the cause behind the man’s symptoms: cancerous lesions that had “completely replaced” the outermost bones of his finger and toe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Images of the man’s finger and toe can be seen &lt;a href="https://x.com/NEJM/status/1945861135263244710"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an X post from the NEJM, and also embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because acrometastases are usually the result of highly advanced cancer, people’s odds of survival once they develop it are already low. People are typically expected to live less than six months after diagnosis. In this case, the doctors opted to treat the patient with palliative radiotherapy, which is intended to alleviate the symptoms of cancer rather than to eradicate it. The man died about three weeks later from &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572109/"&gt;refractory hypercalcemia&lt;/a&gt;, or dangerously high levels of calcium in the blood that don’t respond to standard treatment. This condition is often a complication of cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s bad news for carboholics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that eating bread, pasta and other grain products may trigger or worsen a wide range of psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety and even schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that some people could be especially at risk, with these mealtime staples quietly sabotaging their brains every time they take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A protein widely found in bread, pasta and other grains could be why some people are depressed or anxious.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key culprit, researchers theorize, is gluten.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally occurring protein — found in wheat, barley and rye — acts as a binder that gives baked goods and other foods their structure and chew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most, it’s harmless. But in others, gluten sensitivity can trigger a range of unpleasant symptoms, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, headaches and joint pain, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21622-gluten-intolerance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases, it can develop into celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body mistakes gluten for a harmful invader, like a virus. The resulting immune response triggers inflammation and damage in the small intestine — but the effects may go far beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation that starts in the gut doesn’t stay in the gut. [It] can have a damaging effect on the brain,” Dr. Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist and neuroscientist, told &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/risking-it/202306/it-wasnt-adhd-or-anxiety-it-was-gluten"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When immune cells are activated, the vagus nerve system sends a signal to the brain that can trigger fatigue and depression-like behavior,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Most traditional bread products contain gluten.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bukhta79 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In children, that can look like irritability or symptoms of ADHD. In adults, it may show up as brain fog, mood disorders or more serious psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take depression, for example. While around &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;8% of the general population&lt;/a&gt; is diagnosed with major depressive disorder at some point in their lives, studies suggest that people with celiac disease are hit much harder — with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some research putting the rate as high as 30%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease has also been linked to a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11633532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3641836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;panic disorder&lt;/a&gt; and even schizophrenia. In fact, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2004/celiac-schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with celiac are three times more likely to develop schizophrenia than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond inflammation, research suggests that damage to the gut lining caused by gluten sensitivity may also contribute to these mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That damage can &lt;a href="https://thejemfoundation.com/gluten-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interfere with the absorption of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; essential for brain function, including B vitamins, iron, vitamin D, magnesium and zinc. Deficiencies in any of these can lead to a variety of psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some studies suggest a potential link between celiac disease and an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;andriano_cz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also found that people with schizophrenia often &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4476307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;test positive for high levels of antibodies linked to gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a possible connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These antibodies can cross the placenta, and &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/maternal-gluten-sensitivity-linked-to-schizophrenia-risk-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that mothers with elevated levels may increase the risk of psychosis in their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know everything. But it’s another step closer connecting the dots about these illnesses,” Deanna L. Kelly, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who has spent the past 15 years leading clinical trials in schizophrenia and severe mental illness, told &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-professor-who-believes-eating-bread-could-be-making-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can a gluten-free diet help?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/progression-of-coeliac-disease-its-neurological-and-psychiatric-implications/0FEE9E54B80338FD7A7E3637FCA085E9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that a gluten-free diet can ease anxiety, depression and neurological complications in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some people with gluten sensitivity experience mood changes, including depression. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SHOTPRIME STUDIO – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18622804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one trial&lt;/a&gt;, participants with celiac reported lower anxiety levels after following a gluten-free diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But others show no significant improvement — and in some cases, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20533598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety levels remained elevated&lt;/a&gt; even after cutting gluten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts think part of the problem may come from the psychological stress of managing a chronic health condition.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Being on a gluten-free diet can also lead to some of these psychiatric or mental health issues, because you have to be somewhat hyper-vigilant,” Debra Silberg, a gastroenterologist and chief science officer at Beyond Celiac, told &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/mental-health-issues-and-celiac-disease-are-linked-a-gluten-free-diet-can"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s also a fear of going out and becoming exposed to gluten,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the country, about 1 in every 133 people — roughly 1% of the US population — is estimated to have celiac disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Beyond Celiac&lt;/a&gt;. That adds up to around 2 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the number of people affected by gluten intolerance is much higher. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5677194/#:~:text=Currently%2C%201%25%20of%20the%20United,of%20the%20United%20States%20public." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 6% of the US population — or roughly 20 million people — may be sensitive to gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC posted a food and symptom history questionnaire on its website. The link was distributed widely through a press release and on social media. All persons who experienced symptoms after eating food from the restaurant during October 22–24 were asked to complete the questionnaire. Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who had eaten food from the restaurant and become ill. The hospital provided PHMDC with the names of nine patients who sought care during October 23–24 after eating at the restaurant. On October 25, PHMDC contacted persons on this list who had not completed a questionnaire and asked them to complete the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During October 24–30, PHMDC received 208 responses; 101 were excluded from analysis because they contained 1) mostly incomplete information, 2) the name of a fictional character, 3) names or addresses that included marijuana or THC-related words, or 4) information that indicated the person did not actually eat food from the restaurant. The remaining 107 responses were considered valid (&lt;a id="F2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F2_down"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). An outbreak-associated case of THC intoxication was defined as at least one of the following signs or symptoms (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;): dizziness, sleepiness, anxiety, short term memory impact or time distortion, increased heart rate, nausea, paranoia, panic attack, increased blood pressure, vomiting, or hallucinations in a person who ate pizza, garlic bread, cheese bread, or a grinder (submarine sandwich) purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24, with symptom onset within 5 hours of eating the restaurant’s food. Eighty-five persons met the case definition for THC intoxication. Median time from eating food to symptom onset was 1 hour (range = 0–4 hours). Forty-seven persons meeting the case definition were male, and 38 were female; median age was 43 years (range = 1–91 years). Thirty-three persons consulted a health care provider (28 in a hospital ED and five elsewhere), and three were hospitalized for at least 1 night. Based on self-reporting in the questionnaire comments and information from the hospital, 15 persons received a positive test result for THC (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182880#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Information about whether THC testing was performed was not available from the other 70 respondents. Eight persons (9%) were children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years, none of whom was hospitalized. Dizziness was the only symptom reported for the youngest child (aged 1 year) with “not sure” indicated for all other symptoms in the questionnaire. Four children, aged &amp;lt;13 years (range = 3–8 years), had symptoms of dizziness (four), nausea (four), sleepiness (four), vomiting (three), anxiety (two), paranoia (one), short-term memory impact or time distortion (one), hallucinations (one), head or neck pain (one), and a heavy head (one). Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who ate food from the restaurant and became ill; eight additional persons who became ill after eating at the restaurant were identified, but none completed a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC issued a press release alerting the public via social media not to eat leftover pizza purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24. This information was updated on October 28 to include leftover grinders, garlic bread, and cheese bread. The updated information was shared with the public via social media and PHMDC’s blog, which is posted to the PHMDC website and emailed to approximately 3,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
