                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/aug/20/do-pediatricians-recommend-vaccines-to-make-a-prof/"&gt;PolitiFact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, artificial intelligence and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don’t know seeking to profit from your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-vaccine-hesitancy-may-be-driving-a-spike-in-pediatric-flu-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How vaccine hesitancy may be driving a spike in pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 &lt;a href="https://mvau.lt/media/ab888656-9b01-48fc-8341-fc4588a3bbe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted on X. “They’re pressured to follow the money, not the science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and public health officials have been &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fielding questions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/no-doctors-dont-push-vaccines-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uvpediatrics.com/topics/who-profits-from-my-vaccine-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://shotofprevention.com/2014/10/22/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;for years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drives pediatricians’ childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off of vaccines is counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you’d see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your pediatrician making profits off childhood vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs money to stock, store and administer a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines’ temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on pediatric workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-is-diverging-from-cdc-vaccine-guidelines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the American Academy of Pediatrics is diverging from CDC vaccine guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and for its administration, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians also participate in a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides vaccines for free to eligible children whose parents can’t afford them. Participating in that program &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;isn’t profitable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don’t cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it’s valuable for patients, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don’t make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children’s Health Care System in Texas, said a practice’s ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terk’s practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn’t lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice’s patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies’ payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s driving your pediatrician’s vaccine recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics’ or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your pediatrician will consider your child’s health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a few children —  less than 1% of all children — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child’s doctor,” Diasio said. “Don’t get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got some good news and some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that a new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the good news is not all potatoes are equal: There are plenty of spuds you can keep on your plate, but one preparation has a clear downside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes —but the good news is not all potatoes are equal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Proxima Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re shifting the conversation from, ‘Are potatoes good or bad?’ to a more nuanced — and useful — question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/potatoes-may-increase-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-depending-on-their-preparation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said lead author&lt;/a&gt; Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed over 205,000 people for more than 30 years, taking a close look a their diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked diabetes chances by 20% — but other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That being said, they also found that replacing any type of potato with whole grain foods can lower your type 2 diabetes risk by 4%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And swapping fries with whole grains? That will cut your risk by 19%, while even replacing them with refined grains like white bread made a positive difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public health message here is simple and powerful: Small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes,” said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Limiting potatoes — especially limiting French fries — and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked their diabetes chances by 20%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fahrwasser – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/potatoes-arent-always-bad-for-you-its-all-in-the-preparation/"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; in the past year that’s looked at the relationship between potatoes and diabetes. The last one, out of Australia, found that people who ate the most potatoes had a 9% higher diabetes risk compared to those who ate the fewest taters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And their findings determined boiled potatoes to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we separated boiled potatoes from mashed potatoes, fries or [chips], boiled potatoes were no longer associated with a higher risk of diabetes. They had a null effect,” said Dr. Nicola Bondonno from Edith Cowan University’s Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, which conducted the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s only fries and mashed potatoes [that increase risk], the latter likely because [they’re] usually made with butter, cream and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picking healthier potato recipes seems to be the key — especially since potatoes actually have plenty of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not increase diabetes risk. A previous study found boiled potatoes, in particular, had no effect on diabetes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Valentina Rychkova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have lots of antioxidants like flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids, which can help fight things like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And while starch gets a bad name, potatoes have resistant starch, which feed your gut nutrients and good bacteria. That’s great for digestive health and controlling blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Polish &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/07/potatoes-could-hold-a-powerful-new-treatment-for-cancer/"&gt;researchers found that glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; — naturally occurring chemicals found in potatoes, peppers and goji berries — have some cancer-fighting properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Potatoes are just fantastic,” Caroline Susie, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-foods-bad-reputations-coffee-eggs-rcna147196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, unfortunately, we tend to screw them up by not eating the skin or frying or mixing them with everything under the sun, like sour cream and butter and bacon”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing your gut health through a nutrient-packed diet is an important way to support healthy digestion, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;promote probiotic bacteria growth&lt;/a&gt; in your microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why we asked a gastroenterologist, who specializes in all things gut health, to walk us through her typical day of meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To start the day, de Latour goes for a lighter breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I wake up and have a glass of water, and then I have a protein punch: I eat two egg whites every single morning," she says.

But egg whites are still a protein-packed option, especially for the doc, who isn’t incredibly hungry in the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I don't have a massive breakfast," de Latour explains. "If it was up to me, I would never have breakfast, but it's so necessary to start your day with some protein."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And of course the gastroenterologist has a cup of coffee in the morning, too. Caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-gut-health-8598527" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly option&lt;/a&gt; that can aid in healthy digestion, per recent research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a filling breakfast that can further satisfy your appetite, try a high-fiber gut-healthy smoothie, like gastroenterologist Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8077126/gastroenterologist-breakfast-4-ingredient-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy blueberry-banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For lunch, de Latour goes for a plant-forward option like a salad, which is full of her favorite nutrient to recommend to her patients: fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Unfortunately, our country has a huge, massive issue: we're wildly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;under-eating fiber&lt;/a&gt; and it's very dangerous," she explains. This is supported by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as it’s reported that 90% to 97% of Americans aren’t consuming enough fiber in their diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We think that de Latour would love some of our highly rated high-fiber lunch salads, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8004437/kale-quinoa-apple-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kale, Quinoa &amp;amp; Apple Salad&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944538/orange-mint-freekeh-salad-with-lima-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Orange-Mint Freekeh Salad with Lima Beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dinner is normally the most filling meal of the day, which at times makes it difficult to prepare. But the gastroenterologist likes sticking with her go-to nutritious choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "For dinner, I'll have cauliflower rice with lentils, because it's a protein and fiber mix, specifically plant protein," de Latour says. "And I add some yogurt and some achar, which is pickled vegetables."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We love the protein and fiber combination from the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cauliflower-rice-recipe-8401635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cauliflower rice&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. These nutrients help you stay satisfied after enjoying a bowl. Yogurt and pickled vegetables are both bursting with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which are amazing for the health of your gut microbiome. The doctor sticks to water for her drink with dinner, ensuring that she is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/milk-hydration-benefits-11686387" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refreshed and hydrated&lt;/a&gt; leading into the evening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It sounds very healthy, but it's delicious to me," de Latour says. "Whenever you try to create a habit change, but you enjoy it, you're more likely to stick with it. So that's been really good for my health, and I love it."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you love a healthy meal, why not stick with it? We think it's great that the doctor found a fulfilling dinner she loves including in her regular rotation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the gastroenterologist focuses on nutrients over meal diversity. Including enough fiber, protein and probiotics in her diet is important for her goals, and de Latour considers a plant-forward eating pattern best to meet her health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Find healthy foods you enjoy eating," de Latour advises. "If it's something that is good for you that you enjoy, you're more likely to do it."

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 25 million adults over the age of 20 in the United States have high cholesterol, so if you’re trying to figure out what you can do to lower yours, you’re not alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some believe dietary cholesterol is the main cause, others think only genetics are to blame.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the latest research shows that dietary cholesterol has a relatively small effect on blood cholesterol levels, whereas &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-8691621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat are much more influential in raising LDL (aka the “bad” cholesterol) levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Instead of avoiding cholesterol-rich foods altogether, I tell my clients to limit saturated fats found in fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products,” says &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a good idea to focus on adding heart-healthy fats, like those in nuts, seeds, avocados and fatty fish, she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietary modifications are recommended to help improve abnormal cholesterol levels, they may not be enough to make a significant impact on their own. “This is because blood cholesterol may be impacted by several other factors like sleep, stress levels, exercise and genetics,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It is important to set small attainable goals outside of diet to improve your sleep, incorporate joyful movement and stress-management techniques,” she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that you need to cut out all fats from your diet if you have high cholesterol, but that simply isn’t true. “While some fats can play a role in the development of high cholesterol, not all fats are created equal,” says &lt;a href="http://carlyinthekitchen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carly Hart, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat can increase the risk of developing high cholesterol, but unsaturated fats may actually help to minimize that risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Unsaturated fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to increase your HDL cholesterol (the “good” kind) and lower your LDL (the “bad” kind), reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke,” Hart adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of eliminating fats from your diet completely, work on increasing your consumption of unsaturated fats—by adding more nuts, seeds, avocado and fatty fish—and decreasing your intake of saturated fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people with high cholesterol don’t have any symptoms, so it’s hard to know if you have it without testing. Some people with extremely high cholesterol may show physical signs of the condition, typically fatty deposits and xanthelasmas—yellow deposits around the eyelids. However, in more moderate cases, symptoms can be rare. That’s why it’s important to have regular checkups with your primary care doctor to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;monitor your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might think that only people in larger bodies can get high cholesterol, “but it’s possible to have high cholesterol at any size because it’s related to things like genetics, family history and the foods we eat,” says &lt;a href="https://tweducate.wordpress.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mandy Willig, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to have your cholesterol levels checked regularly regardless of body size. This means every five years for healthy adults over the age of 20, or every year if you have diabetes or a family history of heart disease. Monitoring your lab work allows you to catch any problems early on so you can address them and make any necessary changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-6-you-dont-need-to-worry-about-cholesterol-until-youre-older"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #6: You Don’t Need to Worry About Cholesterol Until You’re Older &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High cholesterol can develop at any age and often starts young, especially in those with a family history of heart disease,” explains &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In fact, about 7% of U.S. children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 have high total cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ideally, you shouldn’t wait until you’re diagnosed with high cholesterol to start being mindful of your eating pattern and lifestyle. Build heart-healthy habits early, like including more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;, limiting saturated fats and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly and managing stress. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hardy recommends encouraging kids and adolescents with elevated cholesterol to stay active. Running around at the park with friends, jumping on a trampoline or joining a sports team may also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-and-cholesterol-health-11792294" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost healthy HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes to your eating habits, exercise routine and other lifestyle changes can help lower cholesterol. But in some instances, lifestyle modifications aren’t enough to make a significant impact and your doctor may recommend adding medications to your cholesterol management plan. Here are some habits you can get started on now to help lower your risk:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re trying to lower your cholesterol, be mindful of your added sugar intake. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Added sugar&lt;/a&gt; can be found in places you least expect it, like in packaged bread, pasta sauce and ketchup. The American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugars to less than 6% of daily calories (about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 for men).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-a-high-fiber-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11692499" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce LDL and total cholesterol. Willig recommends eating fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes to support healthy cholesterol levels at every body size. Try incorporating more high-fiber foods into your meals and snacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Heavy drinking is associated with higher LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can make a big difference when it comes to lowering your cholesterol and improving heart health, making all of your other cholesterol-lowering efforts more worthwhile. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Cardiovascular Exercise. &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise has been shown to increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides and LDL-to-HDL ratio.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add exercise that increases your heart rate, like going for a brisk walk, riding a bike or swimming. Try to do some type of movement each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol is more common than you think, but managing it starts with separating fact from fiction. Focus on increasing your fiber intake, adding heart-healthy fats and getting regular exercise. Remember, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-lower-your-cholesterol-naturally-11769022" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can make a difference, but monitoring your cholesterol and working with your doctor are important for creating an effective plan for long-term success.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow33wt00123b79co7tvqt7@published"&gt;My husband (we’re both men) brought home a guy for a threesome without telling me, saying he wanted it to be a “surprise.” It was. The guy happened to be incredibly hot, so I went along with it anyway, but I think him springing this on me without consulting me first was pretty thoughtless. Should I try pulling the same trick on him and see how he likes it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow345v00153b7939qwg5c5@published"&gt;You’re asking if you should punish your husband for what? Bringing a hot guy home? Please. I agree with you that he should have asked you first, but he didn’t and you tacitly forgave that by having sex. If the experience was nevertheless unenjoyable or even if the shock of the proposition outshined the actual sex, a conversation is in order. Just ask him to talk about it with you first, explaining that this is not the type of surprise that you find fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow348f00163b79vgbcc3bj@published"&gt;But if the sex was really good and you’re miffed purely on principle, I’m going to urge you to try to center yourself in the realm of the practical. You could look at this as a new era in your relationship: your thirds era. Your husband’s method was a bit sloppy but you had fun anyway, and now there is more of that kind of fun that you can have. By all means, you have been given an implicit pass to do the same (at least once), and you should if you are so inspired and can remain in the original sharing spirit. But doing the same thing to him for sheer retaliation is escalating; he was “thoughtless” in your assessment. Don’t see and raise him with calculating and punitive. Keep sex fun and share a guy because it’s a hot thing to do, not to settle a score. Not only is that adding negativity where it doesn’t belong, it’d be treating the third as a pawn, not a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbb002o3b79tvdgusgd@published"&gt;I’m a single, straight male who just turned 60. I’ve never really had much of a sex life outside of masturbation. I’m not a bad looking guy, as I’ve been told, but have never had much confidence in myself. The limited sexual encounters I’ve had have been mainly with escorts (that, however, is a topic for another day.) My question deals with ejaculation. Over the last several years, I’ve noticed a marked decrease in ejaculate strength and volume. When I orgasm, the result is often a dribble, and generally one shot. I masturbate 3-5 times a week on average. What I’d like to know is, is this normal for my age? If not, is there something that I can do to get a little more umph in my game?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As men pass the threshold of middle age, their pelvic floor muscles become weaker and less semen is ejaculated with less force—even down to none at all. Also, the seminal vesicles tend to empty less completely and may become partially blocked by the prostate gland as it enlarges. These are normal consequences of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002t3b794j062q7w@published"&gt;To put an even finer point on this, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430422/"&gt;2007 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 6,000 semen samples found that on average, the peak semen volume came from subjects between 30 and 35 in age, and the lowest volumes came from subjects who were ages 55 and up. Spitz adds that other factors that may play a role in semen volume include hormone balance, hydration, overall health, level of arousal and the strength of one’s pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002u3b79i2z103ao@published"&gt;This may be entirely out of your control, but you may want to consider exercising your pelvic floor (or doing kegel exercises, as they’re called). This typically involves squeezing your pelvic floor muscles repeatedly for periods of time. You can locate the muscle by stopping your flow of urine—working your kegels basically amounts to doing that same thing over and over. There are various online guides for these exercises—I use the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stamena-longer-lasting-sex/id1106687104"&gt;Stamena app&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing to consider is the usefulness of abstinence. A &lt;a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00877-5/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 27 men followed for 16 months found that semen volume increased 11.9 percent per abstained day for the first four days of abstinence and 7.1 percent thereafter. Try taking a few days off and see if that boosts your balls.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002v3b79cv7exzhj@published"&gt;I don’t recommend any kind of supplements that purport to increase semen volume. Any kind of reported success from them is anecdotal and generally on a person-to-person basis (I’ve tried some for the sake of answering these very questions and saw no difference). “I know there are some supplements and despite a friend being one of the ‘founders’ of one of these I would not say they actually do anything,” Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College and my go-to urology source, wrote to me in an email regarding your letter. Something else you might want to look into: Medications (including urologic ones) may cause lower semen volume so if you had any changes recently in your regimen, that may be the culprit. Otherwise, “This isn’t something you need to see a doctor about. There isn’t much you can do,” wrote Welliver.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002w3b79zqfdjv2r@published"&gt;You should also pause to consider why this matters to you. Maybe it’s a way of providing to yourself that your body isn’t as old as the years suggest, or maybe you just like to think to yourself, “Look what I made!,” while gazing at the giant puddle of sperm you just produced. But since your play is largely solo, you’re the only one who’s judging. It’s great to strive for more than what you already are and can do, but self-acceptance is key for happiness. If you can’t boost your volume, find a way to be OK with that. Even if they aren’t big, your loads are still yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002y3b794gowgxf0@published"&gt;I am having an issue that while not the biggest problem in the world, is still something I would rather not deal with.  My wife and I have been together for seven years, married for four. Within the last year and a half, if we don’t have sex the previous night, I wake up with morning wood. I’ve tried jerking off when my wife doesn’t want to have sex, but it doesn’t work. If I don’t get laid or at least a blow job, I will be guaranteed to be standing at attention come morning.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

Anecdotally, at least &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1bftql8/how_longstrong_is_your_morning_wood_my_bf_is_only/"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; reports a more likelihood to get morning wood if he &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; had sex the night before. Regardless, a person like you and a person like him are both likely getting multiple erections a night. The exact reasons for nocturnal penile tumescence, as it’s officially referred to, aren’t known, but it may have something to do with the bladder—perhaps as an alert of its fullness or because a full bladder &lt;a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/hippocampus/story/2020/male-erections"&gt;stimulates nerves&lt;/a&gt; that end up causing these spontaneous erections.&lt;/p&gt;

They are something a lot of guys deal with, mostly by walking them off or peeing upon waking. If your wood is persistent, jerk off or ask your wife if she’s down for a morning bone. Morning wood can be annoying, but its absence can indicate something worse. “Morning and overnight erections are normal! They are good for penile health, bringing in nourishing and oxygenated blood,” wrote Welliver, the urologist I quoted elsewhere in this column. Embrace your morning wood—however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m healthy, fairly handsome, very intelligent, successful, musically talented, generous, and have a great sense of humor. But, I have the absolute most difficult time engaging any type of sex that involves my penis because it’s smaller than average, and noticeably so. It’s been over a decade since I’ve had sex, been on a date, or even had a kiss, because at this point, I have so little self-confidence that I haven’t even attempted to ask a woman out. The penis size issue is a mental block for me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/small-penis-solution-average-size.html"&gt;How do I move beyond this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that personalized gait retraining rivaled medication in effectiveness, opening the door to a new kind of treatment. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by a Utah engineering professor shows that gait retraining can reduce pain and slow cartilage damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one in four adults over the age of 40 live with painful osteoarthritis, a condition that has become one of the leading causes of disability. The disease gradually wears away the cartilage that cushions joints, and there is currently no way to restore this damage. For now, treatment typically focuses on pain management with medication, followed eventually by joint replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Utah, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;New York University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Founded in 1831, New York University (NYU) is a global research institution headquartered in Manhattan, widely recognized for its impact in fields like physics, neuroscience, and computer science.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;New York University&lt;/span&gt;, and Stanford University are now pointing to a promising alternative: gait retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year-long randomized controlled trial, participants who adjusted the angle of their foot while walking reported pain relief comparable to medication. Importantly, these individuals also showed slower cartilage deterioration in their knees compared with those who received a placebo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First placebo-controlled proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is one of the oldest and most respected peer-reviewed medical journals, founded in 1823. It publishes research, reviews, and commentary on global health, clinical medicine, and public health policy. The journal is known for its influence on healthcare debates and global health equity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/span&gt; Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; and co-led by Scott Uhlrich of Utah’s John and Marcia Price College of Engineering, these findings come from the first placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a biomechanical intervention for osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that for people with osteoarthritis, higher loads in their knee accelerate progression, and that changing the foot angle can reduce knee load,” said Uhlrich, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. “So the idea of a biomechanical intervention is not new, but there have not been randomized, placebo-controlled studies to show that they’re effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tailoring treatment to each patient&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;National Institutes of Health&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. Founded in 1887, it is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. With 27 different institutes and centers under its umbrella, the NIH covers a broad spectrum of health-related research, including specific diseases, population health, clinical research, and fundamental biological processes. Its mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; and other federal agencies, the researchers focused on patients with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee (the inner side of the leg), which carries more weight than the lateral, outer compartment. This type of osteoarthritis is the most widespread, but the best foot angle to lessen stress on the medial knee varies for each individual, depending on their natural gait and how it shifts when they adopt a new walking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous trials prescribed the same intervention to all individuals, resulting in some individuals not reducing, or even increasing, their joint loading,” Uhlrich said. “We used a personalized approach to selecting each individual’s new walking pattern, which improved how much individuals could offload their knee and likely contributed to the positive effect on pain and cartilage that we saw.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Treadmill Arthritis Gait Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uq7TxlN-XLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using motion capture cameras, the researchers tracked the degree to which participants walked with their toes pointed inward or outward. Researchers could then calculate the loading in participants’ knees and prescribe the change in foot angle that reduced each individual’s loading. During weekly gait training visits, participants received vibrations on their lower leg after each step, teaching them to walk precisely with their prescribed foot angle. Credit: Utah Movement Bioengineering Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their first two sessions, participants underwent a baseline MRI and practiced walking on a pressure-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras tracked their movements. These assessments revealed whether turning the foot inward or outward reduced knee loading more effectively, and whether a 5° or 10° adjustment was most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individualized evaluation also excluded participants for whom no foot angle adjustment could reduce knee stress. Including such individuals in earlier studies may explain why those trials produced inconclusive results on pain reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Placebo versus intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial intake sessions, the 68 participants were divided into two groups. Half were placed in a sham treatment group designed to measure the placebo effect. These individuals were instructed to walk with foot angles that were identical to their natural gait. In contrast, participants in the intervention group were assigned a foot angle adjustment that most effectively reduced stress on their knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups then took part in six weekly lab-based training sessions. During these sessions, participants received biofeedback in the form of gentle vibrations from a device attached to the shin, which guided them in maintaining the prescribed foot angle while walking on a treadmill. Following the training phase, participants were asked to continue practicing their new gait for at least 20 minutes each day until it became habitual. Regular follow-up visits confirmed that participants were sticking closely to their assigned gait, typically within a one-degree margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, all participants self-reported their experience of knee pain and had a second MRI to quantitatively assess the damage to their knee cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;

At the beginning of the study, participants received a baseline MRI and walked on a force-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras recorded their walking mechanics. Credit: Utah Movement Bioengineering Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reported decrease in pain over the placebo group was somewhere between what you’d expect from an over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen, and a narcotic, like oxycontin,” Uhlrich said. “With the MRIs, we also saw slower degradation of a marker of cartilage health in the intervention group, which was quite exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the quantitative measures of effectiveness, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm for both the approach and the results. One participant said: “I don’t have to take a drug or wear a device…it’s just a part of my body now that will be with me for the rest of my days, so that I’m thrilled with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A long-term option&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ ability to adhere to the intervention over long periods of time is one of its potential advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Especially for people in their 30’s, 40’s, or 50’s, osteoarthritis could mean decades of pain management before they’re recommended for a joint replacement,” Uhrlich said. “This intervention could help fill that large treatment gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this intervention can be clinically deployed, the gait retraining process will need to be streamlined. The motion-capture technique used to make the original foot angle prescription is expensive and time-consuming; the researchers envision this intervention to eventually be prescribed in a physical therapy clinic and retraining can happen while people go for a walk around their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We and others have developed technology that could be used to both personalize and deliver this intervention in a clinical setting using mobile sensors, like smartphone video and a ‘smart shoe’,” Uhlrich said. Future studies of this approach are needed before the intervention can be made widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were all over 30 (their average age was 41), and a majority were of higher socioeconomic status. Requirements were that they lived full-time at the highway-adjacent residence, did not have a history of heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular event, and did not actively take any blood pressure or anti-inflammation medications. The group’s average blood pressure reading was 118.8/76.5 mm Hg at baseline (so within a normal range: The &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65808722/aha-new-how-to-lower-blood-pressure-guidelines-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; aiming for 120/80 mm Hg or lower.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers installed custom-made HealthMate HEPA air purifiers in participants’ bedrooms and living rooms and confirmed that they were used 99% of the time during which the study took place. Participants’ blood pressures were measured four times over two months—at the beginning and end of a month-long “sham purification” or faux air purification and a month of real filtration—and they answered questions about their exposure to second-hand smoke, stress levels, exercise frequency, and general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the study found that the introduction of HEPA filters in the homes of people who live near a highway and have elevated blood pressures “resulted in a modest but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure,” which is the upper number of a reading, explains &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/karishma-patwa-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karishma Patwa, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Karishma Patwa, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LabFinder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LabFinder&lt;/a&gt; contributor. The average net reduction was 3 mm Hg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How HEPA filters may help manage blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution can trigger the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction,” which is the constricting of blood vessels that allow for free blood flow, Dr. Patwa explains. Pollution can also cause chronic structural changes to the arteries, he adds, which can lead to hypertension. “HEPA filters reduce the pollution entering a home, thereby lowering those effects,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is simply a reminder that so many different factors—mental and physical, internal and external—go into blood pressure management. “For me, the key takeaway to this study is that improving air quality, even with a simple low-cost measure, can lower systolic blood pressure, which leads to lower rates of cardiovascular disease,” Dr. Patwa adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hugely popular air purifier uses a HEPA filter that seals allergens inside. It also does triple duty as a heater and air conditioner, and oscillates up to 350 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDQW6Q7W?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65821142%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$489.95 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$489.95 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coway Airmega&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sleek air purifier uses a four-stage filtration system to pull out larger gunk, deodorize your air, and more to remove up to 99. 97% of particles 0. 3 microns or larger from your air.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A registered dietitian sets the record straight on those foods you were previously told are "bad" for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like eggs, shellfish and full-fat dairy actually contain important heart-healthy nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No need to cut out potatoes, coffee or dark chocolate — these foods can also be good for your heart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eggs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, points out that recent research studies have found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-shellfish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Shellfish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-drinking-too-much-coffee-bad-for-you-11745737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse shares that a large cohort study found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044322/are-potatoes-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-packed vegetable&lt;/a&gt; loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-chocolate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Chocolate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-chocolate-11760050" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate with a high cocoa content&lt;/a&gt; (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis study found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with improvements in heart disease risk factors including lowering blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber sources&lt;/a&gt;, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prioritize omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Increased weight brings a higher risk of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and even cardiovascular diseases. Among the various forms of exercise, there is one that requires no equipment, no expensive clothes—just a good pair of shoes and a little time from our busy schedules. This workout is none other than walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article will review a 12-week randomised controlled trial that evaluated these effects in overweight and obese adults, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating moderate walking into weight loss strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the study about and its findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622105833" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;12-week randomized &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;controlled trial has revealed the potent role that moderate walking can play in improving the loss of fat mass and metabolic health when added to an energy-restricted diet in overweight and obese adults. The trial pitted two groups against each other: one was given a calorie-restricted diet alone, while another received the same diet plus a moderate walking program amounting to about 2.5 hours weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups were divided into two:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diet + walking group lost 6.4 kg of fat mass on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diet-only group lost 4.8 kg of fat mass on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main conclusions were that although both groups had impressive weight loss across the intervention period, the diet combined with moderate walking resulted in larger decreases in fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More precisely, the group that participated in moderate walking in combination with dieting lost 6.4 kilograms of fat mass on average compared to 4.8 kilograms in the group that was on the diet alone. There is a significant 33% increase in fat loss from the introduction of moderate walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantages went beyond fat reduction. The diet-plus-walking group also demonstrated substantial improvement in serum insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, as assessed by HOMA-IR, which did not occur in the diet-only group. This indicates that moderate walking not only contributes to fat loss but also increases insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing and treating metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Need for trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasised the effectiveness of moderate walking, which is a low cost, accessible form of exercise. For obese and overweight individuals, integrating regular walking along with a calorie-deficient diet can deliver significantly better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest and most accessible forms of physical activity with a multitude of health benefits. A brisk walk of at least 30 minutes on most days, is all we need to reap the advantages with the intensity described as brisk enough to talk but not sing comfortably. Add walking to your routine, walking a dog, or taking stairs is all one needs to stay fit. It is as easy as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxOUFYyN3hKcmJaa3BBQV81a0p6SzVaMndCOU5TSlVzR0s3b29zVTVTRnA3UXN4MVByUDVhcmdnVnd3Sm9XdGZQblVPUmxSNjhDSi05RWQ5NDBBTi11SWhKSGpsd1Vta1lURk1WVVltdjFsaTctemJpbzJJYUZnelA3T25HcS1DUkVNMll2NTJkZTRvMjMwcXBoNHBTZFJBbmktTkY4NUNiN1ljVldOXzV1RWRpYWF3VVpZZHJKWFJPRlhzQk5Ta21yQkpSdUdVdy15Mzk4QjRxM2dPSkpUQXpGLS0yNU5iNjU4bzYxX3RvREVFWGtsUnh3S1JIQUlRN2VhTlhmV2NuYXF0UQ</guid></item><item><title>学习后的音乐可以提高记忆力，但只能在正确的情感水平上-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/music-learning-memory-emotion-29608/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that listening to music immediately after an experience can enhance memory—if the emotional response is just right. Researchers found that volunteers who experienced moderate arousal while listening to music were better at recalling details, while those with stronger or weaker emotions remembered only the gist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that music can shift the balance between gist- and detail-based memory depending on how it affects the listener emotionally. The findings highlight music’s potential as a low-cost, noninvasive tool for memory enhancement and therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate Emotion Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Detail memory improved only when emotional response to music was moderate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much/Too Little Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong or weak emotions favored gist memory but blurred details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Music could help sharpen memory in aging, Alzheimer’s, or trauma treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to music while doing something can make that activity more enjoyable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But listening to music after an experience or activity can make it more memorable if you have the optimal emotional response while listening to it, according to new research by UCLA neuroscientists published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that whether music was negative or positive or whether it was familiar didn’t have as much of an influence on memory as the emotional response people felt while listening to it,” said corresponding author and UCLA integrative biology and physiology professor Stephanie Leal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112408"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and musical notes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Because the optimal response varied highly between individuals, further research will help Leal’s lab learn how their approach can be tailored for personalized therapies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was an optimal level of emotional response that aided in remembering the details of an experience. Too much or too little emotional response had to opposite effect – worse memory for details, but better memory for the gist of an experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to tease apart the close association between music, emotions, and memory to find ways to improve learning and problems involving memory such as Alzheimer’s disease and PTSD. Music could become a powerful, noninvasive and even pleasant therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study involved volunteers who viewed a series of ordinary household objects, such as telephones, laptops, and oranges. After viewing about 100 images, the volunteers listened to classical music for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their levels of emotional arousal had dropped back down to baseline, they completed tests of their memory for the objects they had seen. They were shown pictures that were either identical to the images they had seen, ones that were very similar but slightly different, and ones they hadn’t seen at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had to identify if the images were exactly the same, or new or different in any way. They also answered questions about their familiarity with the music, and how they felt while listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, music did not improve participants’ memory of the objects. But some individuals showed significant improvement — especially for recognizing that an object wasn’t quite the same during the memory test, but similar. All participants completed a standard questionnaire used by psychologists to measure emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that the individuals with improved memory had experienced a moderate level of emotional arousal, so not too much or too little, whether listening to classical music that sounded uplifting or gloomy, or familiar or unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who felt strong emotions in either direction, in fact, tended to have the most blurry recall of the objects and remembered the gist of the images better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is often a balance between remembering the gist versus the details. Gist-based memory lets us forget some of the details while remembering the big picture of the information or experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because we can’t and don’t need to hang on to every detail of everything we encounter. But it’s also important to be able to remember some specific details, and for that we have detail-based memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used a task designed to tap into the difference between gist- and detail-based memory,” Leal said. “Music helped with detail-based memory but only when the level of emotional arousal was just right for that person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that listening to music immediately after an experience can alter what we remember. For example, listening to moderately arousing music after studying might help you remember the detailed information you need for a test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, listening to music that provokes very strong emotional arousal immediately after studying might have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is finding that optimal level of emotional arousal from music after a learning task can enhance memory as well as what information you want to remember, like the gist or the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music has the ability to influence a part of your brain called the hippocampus, which is essential for turning experiences into memories,” Leal said. “We think it should be possible to tap into that in a selective way to boost or impair memory depending on the therapeutic goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, using music to boost memory for the details of an experience could help people keep their minds sharp as they age, and help improve memory for people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In conditions like anxiety and PTSD, using music that boosts gist-based memory to smooth out experiences that trigger a trauma response could help people cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the optimal response varied highly between individuals, further research will help Leal’s lab learn how their approach can be tailored for personalized therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my lab, we’re trying to detect changes in the brain and cognition early. Music is noninvasive, low cost, and easy to personalize, and by learning more about the mechanisms that connect it to memory, we can develop treatments and interventions to prevent the disease from progressing,” Leal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the federal government reduces funding for Alzheimer’s research, the chances that we’ll be able to develop this line of research into inexpensive yet effective treatments are very low, as developing personalized treatments requires lots of participants in research to really capture individual needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music, learning, and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Holly Ober&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Holly Ober – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/45/31/e0158252025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fine-Tuning the Details: Post-encoding Music Differentially Impacts General and Detailed Memory&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Leal et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-Tuning the Details: Post-encoding Music Differentially Impacts General and Detailed Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music can effectively induce emotional arousal, which is associated with the release of stress hormones that are important for the emotional modulation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, music may serve as a powerful modulator of memory and mood, making it a promising therapeutic tool for memory and mood disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, music’s impact on memory depends on its features, timing, and ability to elicit emotional arousal. In the current study, we manipulated various features of music played during post-encoding memory consolidation to elicit emotional arousal and impact subsequent memory in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that larger increases and moderate decreases in post-encoding music-induced emotional arousal from baseline resulted in gist versus detail trade-offs in memory, with improved general memory but impaired detailed memory, while moderate increases in arousal from baseline corresponded to improved detailed memory, but impaired general memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, relative to controls, music-induced emotional arousal demonstrated unique impacts on detailed memory that are crucial in supporting episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that music intervention does not uniformly impact memory and has important implications in developing personalized music-related interventions for those with memory and mood impairments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 13:25:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5mc0dpSVdfMjlmUUZHYmZNWlBYaGh3ZFVFTl9wTWg1bjFTa01BaldlV0MyYXMtalhkWUFkR0ZKMm1iNE05X3FWZzJGSVU0OFJkQzVTUnVzV0JTMllHcS1BWlJiaHFqU2lzVkxYWkdyak1rT3c</guid></item><item><title>Fox在亚历山大市狂犬病检测呈阳性- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/alexandria/2025/08/fox-tests-positive-for-rabies-in-alexandria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Health officials in Alexandria, Virginia, have issued a rabies alert after a fox in the Del Ray–Rosemont area tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox apparently had contact with a domestic cat near a home Tuesday. The Alexandria Health Department said the fox is now dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said it is working with the cat’s owner on “safe next steps,” but there is “an increased risk of rabies exposures in the community,” &lt;a href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/news-ahd/2025-08-22/alexandria-health-department-issues-rabies-alert-after-fox-in-the-del" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="516" data-start="391"&gt;The health department is urging residents not to approach wild or stray animals, and to make sure pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Rabies can be deadly, and is easily spread through bites or scratches, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Symptoms of rabies in animals include aggression, excessive drooling, and odd behavior, according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Anyone who has seen animals having symptoms of rabies is asked to call Alexandria Animal Control at 703-746-4444. If you or your family members were exposed, contact the Alexandria Health Department at 703-746-4910 during their business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/Rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;City of Alexandria’s website&lt;/a&gt; has more information on how to protect yourself from rabies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some social media users have recommended the use of a diversity jar as an easy way to improve gut health through at-home cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diversity jar aims to add a wider array of plants to your diet, which can boost gut health by fostering a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better gut health can improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and support better nervous system function through the gut-brain axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with an emphasis on anything packed full of protein, there’s one health consideration that nutrition-focused individuals and content creators have been heavily tuned into over the past few years: gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The term might sound nebulous at first, but as the American Medical Association explains, gut health “refers to the well-being of the digestive system, which is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste from the body.” A crucial part of this system is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, or the collection of microorganisms that aids digestion, supports your immune system, and even influences your nervous system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering the far-reaching impacts of the gut microbiome throughout the body, it’s understandable that conscious consumers want to keep theirs balanced, diverse, and healthy. One strategy that several home cooks have suggested online for easily improving gut health is to create a diversity jar. Here’s everything you need to know about this simple nutrition tool and what experts think about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-a-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is a diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/tim-spector" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, MD — a professor of epidemiology at King’s College London, the scientific co-founder of personalized nutrition service &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-gb" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, and the person credited with popularizing the diversity jar — explains that the concept “is essentially a homemade mix of plant ingredients — think nuts, seeds, spices, dried herbs, grains, and even pulses — that you can sprinkle onto meals to boost the diversity of plants in your diet.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The name of the diversity jar gives a clear hint as to what it is. It is a jar filled with various shelf-stable ingredients stored in the kitchen to add a greater variety of plants to each meal. With just a small sprinkle of ingredients from a diversity jar, you can — ideally — incorporate several plants into a single dish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tool is meant to supplement your diet, not replace anything else, and Spector recommends “starting with a spoonful a day, and you can use that spoonful however you wish. Sprinkle it on your morning yogurt, add it to soups or salads, or stir it into a stew or curry. You can always build from there. The beauty is that how you use it is entirely up to you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-benefits-does-a-diversity-jar-provide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What benefits does a diversity jar provide? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Lisa Moskovitz, RD, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Healthy-Eating-Plan-Sustainable/dp/1507216106" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest benefit of a diversity jar is “introducing more gut-friendly fiber and antioxidants.” She also notes that many nuts and seeds — ingredients you’ll typically find in a diversity jar — “pack in plenty of other great nutrients like magnesium, iron, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The diversity part of the diversity jar is key to boosting your gut health and microbiome. Consuming a wider variety of plants introduces more microbes to your gut, resulting in a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system. (Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/apr/04/30-plants-week-gut-health" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating more plants improves gut health, and Spector has recommended aiming to include at least 30 different plants into your diet each week.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chicago.dietitian?lang=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samar Kullab&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, explains that a more diverse gut microbiome can provide benefits like “a stronger immune system (less inflammation and lower risk of allergies and autoimmune conditions), a more resilient gut that bounces back faster after antibiotics or diet changes, and even better mental well-being, since your gut and brain are so deeply connected.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suffer from chronic gut issues like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome, trying a diversity jar might be an easy way to support your digestive health. (Of course, if you have any serious medical concerns, always check with your doctor to find the best course of action.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-do-you-make-your-own-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How do you make your own diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When building a diversity jar, dry goods are your friend. This jar will sit on a counter or in the pantry, so use only shelf-stable ingredients. You don’t need to be exact about the number of ingredients, but aiming for about 10–15 different components is a good target.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector notes that it’s best to aim for variety “both in flavor and in nutritional value.” This is why you should add in more than just two or three ingredients. Kullab suggests starting “with a base of seeds or grains like flax, hemp, black sesame, pumpkin seeds, rolled oats, or even quinoa flakes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next, incorporate a few nuts — any kind will do. (If you're using larger nuts like pecans or cashews, chopping or blending them will make it easier to sprinkle the mixture on your dishes.) Dried herbs, spices like turmeric, and adaptogens such as ashwagandha or maca are just a few examples of the many optional ingredients you can include.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector advises avoiding “anything highly processed or sweetened… The key is to keep it plant-based and well-balanced, with textures and flavors that enhance your meals rather than overpower them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diversity jar is meant to be playful. You may find that some combinations of ingredients don’t taste great on every dish you add them to, while other diversity jar recipes might be so delicious you'd want to sprinkle them on every meal, even if they weren't boosting your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles.

That’s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one controlled study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;one controlled study&lt;/a&gt; by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person’s blood type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes’ potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cues let them know they are going to a blood source,” Day said. “Perhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates ― genetic, other factors ― increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls “secondary cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid — the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise — is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,” Day said. “They are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you’re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won’t as much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mosquito also takes in “tactile cues” once it has landed on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body heat is a really important tactile cue,” Day said. “That comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer — when they land, they’re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.” That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If body temperature is higher, you’re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you’re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,” Piliang said. “Being pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn’t. Of course, drinking outside is a popular summer and fall activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve been moving around all day doing yardwork and then you stop around dusk and drink a beer on your patio, you’re definitely at risk of bites,” Piliang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photoboyko via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photoboyko via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Close-up of young female backpacker tourist applying bug spray on hands&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Prevent Mosquito Bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because you might be more prone to bites doesn’t mean they have to be an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the very best things to do is to avoid peak activity times [for mosquitoes],” Day said. “There are very, very few species that are active in the middle of the day. They are very selective. Sunrise and sunset are when you’ll see peak activity.” Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this tip won’t help you if you’re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are most likely to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,” Day said. “A repellent that has a good protection time ― defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite ― is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do, then more histamine is released and it gets itchier,” she said. “If you scratch it, you’re also more likely to break skin. You can get bleeding, scabs and put yourself at risk for infection and scarring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are a few simple things you can do to alleviate the itch, like putting an ice cube on it. “The sensation of cold travels on the same nerve as itch, so you cannot feel both at the same time,” Piliang said. “Even a drink with ice on it will help relieve itch immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve received several bites after a morning or evening outside, she also recommended over-the-counter anti-itch creams with a mild topical steroid like hydrocortisone. “You can apply that two to three times a day to reduce itch,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And the last thing you can do if you’re really bit up is take an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="antihistamine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;antihistamine&lt;/a&gt;,” she added. “It can counteract the reaction a bit.” While OTC types that make you drowsy — like Benadryl — are more common, you can take non-drowsy antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra for daytime relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The answer depends on your individual needs and goals, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gerrifrench.net/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gerri French, MS, RDN, CDE;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gerri French, MS, RDN, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a nutritionist in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avocado nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described by French as a "wholesome food with lots of merit,” this popular fruit is grown in warm climates like Florida, Mexico and California, and is usually in season late spring through late summer. Despite having over 500 different types of avocado, the Hass variety is likely what you’ll find in the grocery store.

However, they are rich in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9312452/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:monounsaturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;monounsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which are considered healthy — especially for your heart.

In those cases, it's smart to be extra mindful of how much avocado you're eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat avocado&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make sure it's ripe: Give it a squeeze and a little give, with a dark green skin, means it's good to eat. If it’s hard as a rock, simply put the avocado in a paper bag, and place it on your window sill or your counter for a few days, and it’ll ripen right up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to cut it up, which requires a bit of finesse. Begin by slicing the avocado in half, lengthwise and carefully take out the pit. Then, use a spoon and scoop out the flesh of the avocado, and place on a cutting board. Finally, slice up the avocado into your desired thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In salads:&lt;/strong&gt; Drizzle lemon juice on a fresh slice, sprinkle it with salt and pepper and then toss into your salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In salsa:&lt;/strong&gt; French enjoys eating avocados chopped up and mixed with beans, corn and tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast:&lt;/strong&gt; Mash up your avo and then add seasonings like lemon pepper, garlic salt or cajun seasoning and spread it on your favorite bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In smoothies:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend avocado with leafy greens, a little fruit juice and water for a flavorful on-the-go smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grilled:&lt;/strong&gt; Put slices on the grill and then top off your chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baked:&lt;/strong&gt; Bake avocados stuffed with a ground meat and cheese combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;French offers this caution though that &lt;strong&gt;while avocado is a nutritional choice, “the company that it keeps can be the problem.” In other words, think about what you’re pairing it with.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, adding avos to your fave salad, but then drowning it with processed salad dressing is not so healthy. Guacamole is another example. While guacamole is healthy, overeating chips with it every day is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from the experts and from research is pretty clear: Avocados are fine to eat every day, with a caveat. “Just because something’s healthy doesn’t mean more is better. &lt;strong&gt;Sticking to around ⅓ to ½ an avocado keeps things balanced without going overboard on calories or fat,” says Loewenstein.&lt;/strong&gt; So whether you slice it, dice it, blend it, mash it, grill it, bake it or fry it, avocado can be a healthy addition to most eating plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:36:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB2MWpCY0pXS0llWDZjZ1FQb3ZGSlo5Q2lSSDFqcy1DNVFBZ3pCUGJzMG9PQjZtSEp5aGMtNHhBVWU1dUFxTU56Y1k3YTFKWHdSWFBXWDIzVzJSeUR5TkpOZGktTy1ncWNaVm55eTlR</guid></item><item><title>在这里，宾夕法尼亚州的猎人可以检查他们的鹿是否患有消瘦病- WITF</title><link>https://www.witf.org/2025/08/24/heres-where-pa-hunters-can-have-their-deer-checked-for-wasting-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania hunters worried about deer they’ve shot being infected with chronic wasting disease can get their deer tested for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time this fall, hunters can take the heads of deer shot anywhere in the state and deposit them in collection bins located throughout the 10 chronic wasting disease Disease Management Areas for free testing by the state Game Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any deer head placed in a head bin will be tested, regardless of where in the state it was harvested,” said Game Commission spokesman Joshua Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, those collection bins were reserved for the heads of deer taken within the management area where the deer were shot and where the bins were located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who shot deer outside a management area could submit samples on their own for testing to a laboratory for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing hunters to now place heads in management area collection bins from deer taken anywhere in the state is good news for Lancaster County hunters concerned about chronic wasting disease, since there are seven collection bins located here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease is an always-fatal disease that infects deer and elk by attacking the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first found in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado, and then the first case in the wild was detected in an elk in Colorado in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has been spreading across North America ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission began testing for it in Pennsylvania in 1998, but it wasn’t found here until October 2012, when a captive deer in Adams County tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in a wild deer in Pennsylvania was recorded a month later, when three deer in Bedford and Blair counties were found with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2024-25 sampling year, the Game Commission tested over 11,000 deer for chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from those deer were collected through a variety of avenues, including placing heads in the over 120 special, management area collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4,400 heads were obtained just from those collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman reported that 30 deer were collected from the eight bins in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None were found to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, a total of 530 deer were found to have chronic wasting disease from all the sampling done last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When chronic wasting disease is found in Pennsylvania, a management area is created around the site where the deer was found or harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased monitoring then occurs in that area, and hunters are subjected to a slate of special rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the rules are that no high-risk parts — spine, brain, spleen — may be taken out of the management area where a deer was shot, and deer feeding and the use of urine-based lures are banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are 10 deer management areas in Pennsylvania, covering about a third of the state, mainly in the southcentral region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Lancaster County is in management area 4, since chronic wasting disease was found in captive deer kept at a farm in the northern part of the county in 2018, and in the southern part in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has not ever been detected in wild deer in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;READ: &lt;a title="Here's the deadline for applications for Middle Creek's annual archery deer hunt" href="https://lancasteronline.com/tncms/asset/editorial/fe8faa19-567f-4385-b81c-ef1b50d807f7/"&gt;Here’s the deadline for applications for Middle Creek’s annual archery deer hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deer Management Area 4 head collection bins in the county are at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bowmansville Fire Company, 146 W. Maple Grove Road, Bowmansville&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— West Earl Township Building, 157 W. Metzler Road, Ephrata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Muddy Run Recreation Park parking area on Route 372 at Old Pinnacle Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— State Game Lands 136 parking area, Puseyville Road and Street Road, Kirkwood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Blue Rock Fire Rescue House 903, 3079 River Road, Conestoga&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Salisbury Township Office, 5581 Old Philadelphia Pike, Gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area, Hopeland Road, 1 mile East of Route 897&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since head bins are placed in areas where chronic wasting disease has already been detected, it can help provide additional information as to the level of chronic wasting disease in the area and monitoring the effect of management activities over time,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also provides hunters with additional information they can use when deciding to consume venison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission advises hunters not to eat venison from deer known to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While chronic wasting disease has not been shown to infect humans, federal health officials consider it a theoretical risk, leading to the recommendation to avoid consuming meat from chronic wasting disease-positive animals,” the agency’s website states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who want to have deer tested for chronic wasting disease should place the head — with harvest tag filled out and attached to the ear — in a plastic garbage bag and seal it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antlers attached to the skull will not be returned, so remove those first if you want to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the bag into a collection bin, where samples are picked up by Game Commission staff about twice a week during hunting seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from each head are removed and sent to a lab for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When results are returned to the Game Commission, that information is entered into a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency then mails a postcard to the submitting hunter informing them how to check for results either online at pgc.pa.gov or by calling the chronic wasting disease hotline at 833-463-6293.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chronic wasting disease is confirmed in a sample, the submitting hunter will be notified via certified letter with the test result and information on what the hunter can/should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said it takes about two weeks for test results to come back, although that time might be a bit shorter in early archery season or a bit longer during the firearms season.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, the mother of three noticed a pimple at the bottom right corner of her nose, near her nostril. Still, she decided not to pop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I came home from work one night and I could feel my face was already starting to hurt badly," she says, noting that she washed her face to get all her makeup off and washed her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was super clean about it, and my husband said, 'Let me try to pop it,'" she recalls. "I said, 'I don't think we should. I'm gonna let this one go for the first time, I'm not gonna touch it.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, Monaco's husband is the one who reminds her not to pick at her pimples. But this time around, he seemed to think it would be an easy one to pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Monaco washed her hands, sterilized the area, cleaned her extraction tools, and gave it a go. After five minutes, Monaco still wasn't successful, but she was more determined than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha Monaco/Tiktok&lt;/p&gt; Alisha Monaco and her pimple&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was pushing on it, and this is where I knew I messed up because I pushed on it and tried to pop it, and my right ear popped," she recalls. "It scared the life out of me... I've never had that happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking it as a warning sign, Monaco decided she wouldn't touch the blemish anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cleaned it off again, washed my face, and brushed my teeth," she says. "I put a pimple patch on it, because I [wanted] to help absorb anything that came out of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she looked online to figure out what may have happened, she began reading up on the "triangle of death," an invisible triangle in the middle of your face from the bridge of your nose to the corners of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's recommended not to pop a pimple in that area, as "it can lead to an infection in your brain," according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/danger-triangle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The small surface area has "a direct line to the brain," thanks to the "cavernous sinus, a network of large veins located behind the eye sockets." Blood drains from the brain through this sinus, meaning an infection in the danger triangle "has a small but not impossible chance of traveling from your face right to your brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just four hours of sleep, Monaco woke up in excruciating pain. When she ran to the bathroom, she saw that her smile was completely crooked. She was unable to lift one side of her face, and her vision was blurry on that same side. The ear that had popped also felt full of fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she tried to go back to sleep, but when she woke up again, her face looked even more swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got in her car and drove to urgent care, arriving right after they opened. Since she was just the second person in line, they treated her right away. She was prescribed an oral antibiotic, a topical antibiotic, a steroid pack, and Flonase for the fluid in her ear. Despite her discomfort and concern, they told her that her symptoms weren't out of the ordinary given the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first 12 hours, Monaco says the swelling began to subside. After three days, it was gone entirely. As instructed, she finished the cycle of antibiotics and steroids even after feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha Monaco/Tiktok&lt;/p&gt; Alisha Monaco pimple gone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco documented her health saga on TikTok and posted a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lishmarie1/video/7535892627510611214" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of herself in urgent care, captioned, "Reminder - do not pop a pimple in the death triangle. Or you'll end up in urgent care."

But with grocery prices sky-high at the moment, many people may think the diet is financially out of reach. (After all, salmon and walnuts are not cheap!) This week, dietitian and Yahoo contributor Lauren Manaker wrote about the cost of the Mediterranean diet for Yahoo and shared &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:some pointers on how to follow the plan;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;some pointers on how to follow the plan&lt;/a&gt; without busting your budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One easy tip to follow? &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/squeamish-around-sardines-tinned-fishs-health-benefits-might-convince-you-otherwise-090042646.html" data-ylk="slk:Swap out fresh fish for canned varieties;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Swap out fresh fish for canned varieties&lt;/a&gt;, like omega-3 rich salmon and sardines. Not only are the tinned options more affordable than their refrigerated counterparts, but canned fish is also shelf stable — meaning it won’t spoil in the back of your fridge because you forgot to eat it in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another way to save money but still get plenty of nutrients is to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/7-best-frozen-vegetables-eating-140710729.html" data-ylk="slk:enjoy frozen veggies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;enjoy frozen veggies&lt;/a&gt; rather than fresh.

Since we lose water from breathing and sweating overnight, dietitian Amy Shapiro says that “drinking water in the morning helps restore normal hydration levels, which supports energy and focus.” And that’s not all: Staying properly hydrated can also aid in digestion and even help you consume fewer calories at your next meal for better weight management. Sticking to drinking more water earlier in the day, and tapering off closer to bedtime, also means you’ll be less likely to wake up in the middle of the night to pee, which can disrupt your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-walking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🚶;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🚶&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take a power walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Step up your walking game by turning it into a “power walk,” aka a walk you do at the top of your walking speed, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/power-walking-back-big-way-180100467.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reports. You’ll get all the benefits of walking — boosting your heart and lung health, better management of blood pressure and blood sugar and burning more calories, not to mention improving your mood — but in a shorter amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura A.

Make sure to bend and swing your arms for momentum, engage your core and focus on taking smaller, quicker steps rather than a wider stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/beverage-box" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🧃;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🧃&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pick this juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Juice may have a health halo, but often it’s nothing more than water flavored with sugar, our friends at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/healthiest-juice-dietitians-share-no-170041992.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; tell us. If you are going to grab one, however, some picks are better than others. Experts for Today say to look for 100% juice, which is the most dense in nutrients. Juices made from pomegranate, beet and low-sodium vegetable juice are great options because they’re packed with antioxidants. And if you’re looking for something to improve your night’s rest, try tart cherry juice, which contains sleep-inducing melatonin and tryptophan. It’s also great for after a workout since it can help reduce muscle soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/shower" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🚿;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🚿&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shower right after you work out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It may seem like it’s no big deal to put off showering after a workout, especially if you’re heading straight to an alfresco brunch or work from home where no one can smell you while answering emails. But experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/dermatology/articles/yes-shower-immediately-workout-doctors-162300355.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; you really should rinse off ASAP. Not only will doing so prevent odor, but it also prevents the risk of not-so-fun stuff, like acne, skin irritation and even folliculitis, which is when hair follicles become inflamed, leading to pimple-like bumps. Postworkout, stick to products made for sensitive skin, even if you don’t typically have it — your skin can be extra sensitive following exercise due to increased blood flow. And while exfoliation is great to do twice a week to prevent dead skin buildup, skip it immediately after a tough gym session for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/olive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🫒;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🫒&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Buy olive oil in this container&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Olive oil is full of heart-healthy fat and has even been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/olive-oil-good-fast-nutrition-100319387.html" data-ylk="slk:linked to better brain health and reduced joint pain;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;linked to better brain health and reduced joint pain&lt;/a&gt;. But if you want the most bang for your buck, pick an olive oil that’s packaged in a dark glass bottle rather than plastic, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/why-always-buy-olive-oil-170000643.html" data-ylk="slk:Martha Stewart;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; reports. Unlike plastic containers, it’s harder for oxygen to seep into glass bottles, which can shorten the oil’s shelf life and even cause it to go bad faster. Also, putting olive oil in plastic can cause chemical migration, especially when the olive oil is warm (like, say, in your pantry on a hot day), which can change the way it tastes. Meanwhile, “dark glass is non-reactive, so it won't interact with the oil, and it shields it from damaging UV rays," Jill Myers, founder of Women in Olive Oil, tells the outlet. Bonus points? Dark glass will look prettier in your cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/wine-glass" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍷;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍷&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pass on alcohol to keep your blood pressure in check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association just updated its guidelines on the best ways to lower blood pressure and protect your heart, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/number-1-way-lower-blood-123000169.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reports. One notable shift: The AHA now recommends avoiding alcohol. Though there have been “differing views on alcohol and potential cardiovascular risk” over the years, cardiologist Shaline Rao tells Prevention, the AHA has now seen that “consistent alcohol intake has more potential for risk than benefit.” One reason to skip it has to do with how the liver metabolizes the alcohol, which causes the blood vessels to constrict. This leads to stiffer blood vessel walls and, therefore, higher blood pressure over time. So the next time you’re at an event, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-to-make-healthier-mocktails-according-to-dietitians-5-alcohol-free-recipes-to-try-110059545.html" data-ylk="slk:try a fun mocktail;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;try a fun mocktail&lt;/a&gt; instead, or just cut back on how many drinks you have throughout the evening by having a glass of water in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/sponge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🧽;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🧽&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exfoliate the right way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Exfoliation is great for your skin — it removes dead skin cells, smooths skin texture and boosts product absorption. But doing it too often can backfire and leave your skin dry, irritated and inflamed, as well as more prone to breakouts. Experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/beauty/skincare/articles/often-exfoliate-face-according-dermatologists-133000370.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; that you should tailor how often you exfoliate to your skin type: Aim for one or two times weekly for dry, sensitive, combination or mature skin, and two or three times a week for oily or acne-prone skin.

Eating colorful, whole foods like legumes, leafy greens, nuts, and wholegrains gives your brain a nourishing buffet of vital nutrients. They help you think clearly, stay energized, and feel brighter. By mixing colorful veggies, whole grains, nuts, beans, and maybe an egg or two, you’re giving your brain its very own power-up team – all without needing extra pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice or diagnosis.

Sneaky skin agers like sugar, soda, and ice cream don’t just taste sweet… they can accelerate wrinkles and steal your radiance," he warns his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ice cream breaks down collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice cream may be comforting, but it’s secretly rough on your skin. All that sugar creates something called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which break down collagen and elastin—the proteins that keep your skin firm and bouncy. Without them, skin gets saggy and fine lines pop up faster. Plus, the dairy can trigger inflammation or acne for some people, leaving skin looking less clear. The combo of sugar and dairy is like a double hit to your glow, making ice cream more of a wrinkle-creator than a beauty booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cola dehydrates your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cola feels refreshing, but it’s actually dehydrating your skin. The high caffeine content acts like a diuretic, meaning it makes your body lose water faster. Dehydrated skin looks dull, tired, and more prone to fine lines. On top of that, cola is loaded with sugar, which damages collagen, speeding up wrinkles and sagging. The acidity can also weaken your teeth, taking away from your overall youthful look. Basically, every sip gives you a quick energy rush but quietly steals your skin’s bounce and brightness. Swap it out with sparkling water if you want glow instead of dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit juices have added sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though fruit juice sounds healthy, most store-bought versions are loaded with sugar—sometimes as much as soda! That sugar spikes your blood glucose, leading to glycation, which weakens collagen and elastin. Over time, skin loses firmness and elasticity, showing wrinkles sooner. To make things worse, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so you’re just getting a big sugar dump without the benefits. This sugar rush also creates inflammation, which can worsen acne or redness. While fresh juice in moderation is fine, guzzling it daily can definitely fast-track dullness, sagging, and premature skin aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Margarine reduce skin hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margarine used to be marketed as the “healthy” butter swap, but it’s actually loaded with trans fats. These fats can stiffen cell membranes and reduce skin hydration, leaving you with dry, rough-looking skin. Even worse, they may damage collagen, which is your skin’s natural scaffolding. Without strong collagen, fine lines and sagging show up faster. Some studies even connect trans fats with increased inflammation, which makes skin more vulnerable to breakouts and redness. So, while margarine might spread smoothly on toast, it’s not doing your face any favors—it’s more like spreading wrinkles over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Artificial sweeteners can cause inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners might seem like a smart sugar hack, but they can mess with your skin in sneaky ways. They confuse your body, triggering insulin responses even without actual sugar, which can lead to inflammation. That inflammation shows up on your skin as dullness, breakouts, or redness. Some studies also suggest sweeteners can mess with gut health, and since your gut is tied to your skin, that imbalance may speed up aging. While they don’t directly cause glycation like real sugar, they still mess with your skin’s natural balance, making your complexion look less smooth and youthful over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muffins weaken collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muffins might look innocent (especially the blueberry ones that scream “healthy”), but they’re really little sugar bombs. The refined flour and sugar combo spikes blood sugar, leading to glycation that weakens collagen. That means skin starts sagging earlier, with wrinkles creeping in faster. Plus, most muffins are made with unhealthy oils that add to inflammation, making skin dull and puffy. What feels like a cozy morning treat is really a hit to your skin’s glow. Eat them often enough, and your skin will show it—trading radiance for tiredness. Basically, muffins are dessert in disguise, and your face knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol dehydrates the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol might make you feel relaxed, but your skin pays the price. It’s a powerful dehydrator, which leaves your skin looking dry, flat, and more lined. Dehydrated skin shows wrinkles more easily and loses that fresh glow. Alcohol also inflames your skin, which can worsen redness, puffiness, or conditions like rosacea. Over time, it messes with vitamin A levels too—an essential nutrient for skin repair. Without enough of it, your skin struggles to renew itself, so signs of aging show up faster. A glass here and there is fine, but too much drinking leaves your face looking older, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give your skin the love it deserves by ditching these culprits and choosing nourishment that works for you—not against you. Radiance starts from within," the biohacker urges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 01:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>尼亚加拉县确认有狂犬病小猫；卫生官员敦促谨慎行事- WGRZ</title><link>https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/health/rabid-kitten-confirmed-niagara-county/71-2f82e7b0-3d72-4332-aa99-2964241b3671</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Several people who had direct contact with the kitten are now undergoing post-exposure rabies measures.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCKPORT, N.Y. — The Niagara County Department of Health has confirmed a case of rabies in a kitten found in the Town of Cambria.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kitten, located on Saunders Settlement Road between Diller Road and Fairview Drive, tested positive for rabies on August 21 after displaying aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, the kitten had been examined by an Erie County veterinarian on Aug. 14 after showing signs of neurological illness, including biting and scratching. It was euthanized the following day and submitted for testing to the New York State Department of Health’s Wadsworth Center, Griffin Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results received on Aug. 21 confirmed the rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people who had direct contact with the kitten, including at its residence and the veterinarian’s office, are now undergoing post-exposure rabies measures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This case serves as an important reminder that even seemingly harmless domestic animals can contract rabies from contact with infected wildlife," the Niagara County Department of Health said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral disease that is almost always fatal in unvaccinated animals and remains a serious public health concern in Niagara County. The virus is commonly carried by wildlife such as bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes, and can be transmitted to people and pets through direct contact, even before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are reminding residents to take precautions, including keeping pets up to date on rabies vaccinations, avoiding contact with wild or stray animals, and not leaving pet food or garbage outside where it could attract wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinated pets serve as a crucial buffer between rabid wildlife and humans, significantly reducing your risk of exposure," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Niagara County Department of Health offers free rabies vaccination clinics for pets, with schedules posted on its website. By law, all cats, dogs, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are also urged to keep pets indoors at night, board up potential entry points for wildlife around their homes, and teach children not to touch unfamiliar animals. Anyone whose pet comes into contact with a potentially rabid animal should immediately call a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

A few weeks ago, I threw up at work with such force that I peed myself. My first thought was: the treatment pamphlets tell you to sip peppermint tea and keep a fan at your desk for nausea, but nowhere did they mention you might find yourself in the staff bathroom vomiting so hard you become incontinent. If they had, I’d have popped a spare pair of undies in my work bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was diagnosed just before Christmas last year. It was a complete shock: I was 44 and the healthiest I’d been in years. At first, I was given an excellent prognosis, and after the initial shock, I rallied like never before. I decided I was going to face this head-on, full of positive energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"australia-news","tags":[{"id":"australia-news/series/the-rural-network","type":"Series","title":"The rural network"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"australia-news/rural-australia","type":"Keyword","title":"Rural Australia"},{"id":"australia-news/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","type":"Keyword","title":"Australia news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/the-rural-network","type":"Tracking","title":"The rural network"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"australia-news/2025/aug/24/ive-been-diagnosed-with-cancer-twice-in-the-past-12-months-heres-what-the-pamphlets-dont-tell-you","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But after surgery and pathology, the language shifted. They started using the word “good” instead of “excellent&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;, and we realised this was going to be more of a fight. I gathered as much information as I could, along with every resource available, determined to be prepared. But nobody told me about the messy parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f6b42809-9208-453d-acfe-4c1fe2d9ca4b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sweaty and flustered, my breast cancer patient was experiencing hot flushes.

You don’t have to follow the advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At one of your initial appointments, you will be handed a tonne of information from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Council, and most of it is solid gold. But you don’t have to do everything that’s recommended. This is a shock, and I’m sorry it’s happened to you, and it’s OK to do this your way. I started by sharing everything publicly and was overwhelmed with wonderful support. Nine months in and I’ve retreated into myself and don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Both are OK. My oncology counsellor told me to stick to my normal schedule as much as possible and not to give cancer more power than it already has. This was fine until recently when I had to cut back hours at work. I’m not giving cancer power, however – I’m giving my body the rest it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-give-your-body-what-it-needs" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;2. Give your body what it needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Right now I need rest,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;nutritious meals when I can handle them, sunlight and movement. There’s new research that suggests &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/01/exercise-better-than-drugs-after-cancer-treatment-international-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;exercise plays a vital role &lt;/a&gt;in cancer treatment, and it’s encouraged where possible. Personally, I find it improves my mood, gets me outside and helps me feel I’m taking a proactive step towards health. Likewise, I spoke to a fellow cancer warrior who explained that she loves juicing – each day she will head to the fruit market and carefully choose her fruits and vegetables. She explained she understands that juice is probably doing nothing for her cancer, but it’s not bad for her and helps her feel proactive. I’m not into juice, but after speaking with her, I now have salad for lunch every day. My daily bowl of rainbow veggies isn’t a cure, but it is a ritual that feels as though I’m telling cancer to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-your-body-will-change-in-unexpected-ways" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;3. Your body will change in unexpected ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You might pee yourself when you spew – look, it happens. Chemotherapy in particular will mess with your digestive system and you will immediately map out the toilets of any public space you are in. You might lose your hair – everywhere. Losing your nasal hair means your nose will run constantly. Losing your pubic hair makes you fart really loudly. Steroids make you pack on weight; other medications will strip it off frighteningly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-cancer-hurts-and-some-of-that-pain-is-financial" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;4. Cancer hurts, and some of that pain is financial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have stopped working full-time and we are so very broke right now. My diagnosis coincided with the cost-of-living crisis, so we’ve never needed a second income more. And cancer is expensive. It’s not as bulk billed as you would expect – the fine needle biopsy used to diagnose my cancer cost $380 after the Medicare rebate. The medical costs add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-you-will-become-your-own-best-advocate" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;5. You will become your own best advocate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sure, you should find a knowledgable medical team who has your best interests at heart, but you know your body best. If something doesn’t feel right, keep pushing until it’s paid attention to. It’s OK to demand that scan, try a different medication and to discuss treatment options. You are not difficult. You deserve solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6-you-will-lose-friends-and-gain-unexpected-ones" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;6. You will lose friends and gain unexpected ones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s this idea that challenging times “show us who our real friends are” but that’s not the case at all. Cancer is a lot, and not everyone can take this journey with you. It doesn’t make them bad people, it’s just that life is heavy for everyone and they don’t currently have space for you. But the people who stay with you will hold you up in ways you never knew you’d need, and you’ll make new friends too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7-cancer-is-a-rollercoaster" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;7. Cancer is a rollercoaster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lots of metaphors work, but this one is the best. The sudden jolting start, the highs, the lows, the speed increase and decrease and the twist you didn’t see coming. All of this is geared to get you to the exit: remission or NED – no evidence of disease. But here’s what you didn’t know: if you’re lucky you can get off the rollercoaster, but you can’t ever leave the amusement park. Every three, six, 12 months you have your scans and blood tests and see if you’re being dragged back on for another spin. I was thrown back on this year after a scan revealed new tumours, this time in my lung. I have lost the positivity that powered me through the first round. I’m not sharing as much because there’s nothing to say. It isn’t fair the first time, but the second time hits you where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="98544d55-ff73-41f3-8bff-0706ba12368e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘It’s some sort of cosmic joke’: Tracy Sorensen wrote a book about surviving cancer.

My family and friends, once they knew what was going on, cooked meals, grocery shopped, took care of our youngest and supported our eldest. I live in regional New South Wales and the charity &lt;a href="https://canassist.org.au/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Can Assist&lt;/a&gt; has been a lifeline. They pay for all of my cancer medications, including my radiation meds, and will cover transport and accommodation costs when I have to travel to Sydney for treatment. Your local hospital should be able to point you in the direction of a social worker who will find all of these helpful options for you. There’s probably a support group near you – make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9-you-dont-have-to-stay-positive" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;9. You don’t have to stay positive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You don’t have to be brave. You don’t have to be the best cancer patient and be liked and be an example to others. It’s OK to cry. Just make sure you reach out for help if it feels as if you are drowning in your tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="10-you-wont-be-the-same" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;10. You won’t be the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You will experience a loss of autonomy like never before. One moment my husband and I were discussing trying for a third baby, and the next I’m signing forms promising to not get pregnant for at least 12 months post radiation. But I’m stronger and surer of myself now, and I understand the fragility of life. I take fewer things for granted and prioritise my family over my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The pamphlets can’t tell you all this. But those of us who’ve been on the ride can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And if you’ve just found yourself holding that ticket – pack the spare undies.

What you eat and drink shapes that microbial community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy sits in the middle of the conversation because it provides nutrients and, sometimes, live cultures, yet researchers don’t always agree on its effects. A careful study that sampled the colon lining directly adds useful clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet studies often rely on stool samples. That’s helpful, but it doesn’t always reflect the bacteria that stick to the gut wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project looked at those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;wall-attached microbes&lt;/a&gt;, which sit directly against our tissues. The goal was straightforward: see whether everyday dairy habits show up in that community of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome"&gt;Understanding the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your gut microbiome as a bustling neighborhood of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-fingerprints/"&gt;trillions of microbes&lt;/a&gt; – mostly bacteria, plus some fungi and viruses – that live mainly in your large intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help break down parts of food you can’t digest on your own, especially fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that feed your colon cells and help keep inflammation in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes also train your immune system, make certain vitamins, and interact with your nervous system through chemical signals. That’s where we get the term “gut feeling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s microbiome is a little different, shaped by birth, diet, environment, sleep, stress, and medicines like antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversity tends to be a good sign: a wider variety of species usually means a more stable, resilient community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no single “perfect” microbiome, but you can nudge yours in a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-find-link-between-obesity-anxiety-and-gut-microbiome-changes/"&gt;healthy direction&lt;/a&gt; with balanced meals, regular movement, enough sleep, and cautious antibiotic use when medically needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-how-dairy-shapes-gut-bacteria"&gt;Learning how dairy shapes gut bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults undergoing routine colonoscopies at a veterans’ hospital in Houston participated. Their colons appeared normal, and none had &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-helps-fight-cancer-by-changing-gut-microbes/"&gt;major conditions&lt;/a&gt; that could confound the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the procedure, doctors collected pinhead-sized biopsies from the colon lining for lab analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the team analyzed 97 biopsies from 34 people. Beforehand, participants completed a food questionnaire that covered the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;milk, cheese, yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, and total dairy intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the group used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify which bacteria were present and in what amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two basic yardsticks apply. “Alpha diversity” refers to how many kinds of bacteria are in a single sample. “Beta diversity” compares how different two people’s communities are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis adjusted for age, body size, smoking, alcohol use, health conditions, overall diet quality, and which part of the colon the sample came from. That helps separate signals that are likely true associations from those created by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-scientists-learned"&gt;What the scientists learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drank more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/extreme-heat-makes-dairy-cows-produce-less-milk/"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; – and those who consumed more total dairy – tended to have higher alpha diversity in the bacteria attached to the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta diversity also differed between higher and lower consumers of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt, indicating that intake patterns were associated with broader shifts in community structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two familiar bacteria stood out. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/faecalibacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt; is often considered beneficial because it makes butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that fuels colon cells and can calm inflammation. People who consumed more total dairy and more milk had more Faecalibacterium on the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00631-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, frequently linked to a strong gut barrier and better metabolic markers, also appeared at higher levels with milk intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-products-and-bacteria"&gt;Dairy products and bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team accounted for dietary lactose, the milk-microbe links weakened. That points to lactose as a possible &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/boost-your-gut-health-top-five-prebiotic-rich-foods-revealed/"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; – food for specific bacteria – that may help certain microbes grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fits a simple nutrition fact: milk contains lactose, while many hard cheeses have very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese didn’t follow milk’s pattern. Higher cheese intake was associated with lower amounts of certain bacteria in adjusted models, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2176045/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/a&gt; and Subdoligranulum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t treat Bacteroides as purely good or bad; it depends on the species and context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt; can produce butyrate, which is usually beneficial, so seeing lower levels with higher cheese intake raises questions about which cheese components might shift the balance. Turning milk into cheese changes nutrients in ways that could matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt intake here was very low on average – approximately a few sips per day – so the study couldn’t draw firm conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t see clear links between yogurt and diversity, and classic yogurt cultures like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/worlds-oldest-cheese-discovered-alongside-ancient-mummies/"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-gut-health-shapes-the-brain-development-of-her-baby/"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; appeared at very low levels on the colon lining in these samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-lining-yields-clues"&gt;Colon lining yields clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most data we see come from stool samples, which reflect what exits the body. The mucosa – the gut’s surface – can look different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the wall-attached community gives a closer view of the microbes that interact with the gut barrier and immune cells. It reflects the mucosal surface rather than only what is present in stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-bacteria-dairy-and-health"&gt;Gut bacteria, dairy, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tolerate dairy and already drink milk, your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/move-over-microbiome-its-time-for-the-human-guts-virome-to-shine/"&gt;gut’s surface community&lt;/a&gt; may be more diverse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cheese is your main dairy, the effects likely depend on the type of cheese, your overall diet – especially fiber – and your individual microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t tolerate lactose well, prebiotic fibers from beans, oats, bananas, onions, and asparagus can nourish beneficial bacteria by another route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different dairy foods appear to influence the gut’s wall-attached community in distinct ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger, longer studies in more diverse groups will help test which dairy components do what, and for whom. For now, what goes in your glass and on your plate shows up in your gut in measurable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPWTdQUWQ0SE9BNV80eE5FMWxxMkd0dFZKRU1fRkJPQk1jUzY5RkFoOFFKMVdnVmdxbkU0T0FqUEx1cmRjNWxvcUFyYmFHeTNLUjhrTW1HckJIeW9IQkpKN2RYSDBpVlNSazZwNTVFa3FCZ1RTaDN4MTFyZmhaYVBaYTl0VGRUYXJHd3c0dWV2VGROSXQwMnhzYkJodXJiNTUtSzBzdlVnZU8</guid></item><item><title>为什么“僵尸松鼠”出现在美国和加拿大-福布斯</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/08/23/why-zombie-squirrels-have-been-appearing-in-the-us-and-canada/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-0" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;News of “zombie squirrels” appearing in the U.S. and Canada may be a bit shocking to squirrels and humans. (Photo: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of “zombie squirrels” may seem a bit nuts to you. But that’s the term that people have been using to describe what they’ve been seeing in the U.S. and Canada— squirrels with strange, at times bleeding, lumps all over their bodies. These lumps can make them look a bit like the characters seen on the TV series &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;—the undead ones without speaking parts, that is. Except these squirrels aren’t actually undead. They’re very much alive but probably suffering from what’s called squirrel fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Zombie Squirrels Are Actually Squirrels With Tumors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called fibromatosis because the lumps are tumors called fibromas. A fibroma is a non-cancerous tumor consisting of fibrous connective tissue. These tumors can range in size on squirrels from a few millimeters to 25 millimeters in diameter. The impact of these growths depends on where the tumors are situated. In many cases, when these tumors are just on the squirrel’s skin for enough from vital parts, they won’t have major serious consequences—except perhaps affecting a squirrel’s ability to get dates, assuming that other squirrels are as superficial as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things can get real squirrely when the tumors impinge upon vital structures. For, example, tumors close to the eyes can affect the squirrel’s vision. Things can get worse when the tumors spread inside the body, like to the lungs, liver, kidneys and lymph nodes. There they can cause obstruction of different body passageways, organ malfunction and even death. Another risk is that such lumps can get infected by various microorganisms beyond the microorganism that caused the fibromatosis in the first place. But more on that squirrel tale later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some people on social media seem to be going nuts about squirrel fibromatosis, this disease isn’t new. Squirrels with this ailment have been spotted ever since at least 2023. It’s just that for whatever reason more humans have been noticing such zombie squirrels recently and commenting about them on social media. And things aren’t real until they’ve reached social media, right? Here’s an example of a recent post on Facebook showing an example of these lumps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;From Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;From Facebook&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Zombie Squirrels Result From Infection By A Virus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of these zombie squirrels may have gone viral on social media. But there is something else viral about this disease— its cause. Infection with a virus called leporipoxvirus leads to these tumors. This virus belongs to the pox group of viruses. That’s why squirrel fibromatosis is also known as squirrel pox, which can be a little confusing since there is another completely different virus, the UK squirrelpox virus, that can cause a completely different disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squirrels can catch the leporipoxvirus by being bitten by mosquitoes like the &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;aegypti&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;quadrimaculatus&lt;/em&gt; or fleas carrying the virus. An infected squirrel can also pass along the virus to another squirrel by direct physical contact. Tumors typically first develop in the body area where the transmission of the virus occurred whether it’s where the virus-carrying insect bit the squirrel or where contact with the infected squirrel occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Is There A Treatment For Zombie Squirrels?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news, if you happen to have a large bushy tail and really love acorns, is that there’s no treatment for this disease. The good news is that when the disease is not severe, the lesions can end up regressing over time, and you, assuming you are a squirrel, can ultimately fully recover. Plus, there hasn’t been any evidence that this disease has significantly affected the North American population numbers of grey squirrels, the type of squirrels currently being affected, &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/squirrel-pox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/squirrel-pox" aria-label="according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources"&gt;according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Do Zombie Squirrels Pose A Threat To Humans?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t happen to be a squirrel but are a rabbit or woodchuck, you may still have to worry about getting infected with the leporipoxvirus. While the only documented transmissions in nature have been to squirrels, scientists have managed to transmit the virus to rabbits and woodchucks in laboratory settings. If you are not sure whether you are one of these animals, check yourself in the mirror, contact your doctor, ask yourself if anyone has remarked how long your ears are or see how annoyed you get when you hear the question, “How much wood can a woodchuck if a woodchuck would chuck wood?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you are human, then there doesn’t seem to be a risk that you will get infected. This may even be the case if you happen to eat an infected squirrel, should that be part of your cuisine. This doesn’t necessarily rule out the possibility of the virus mutating some day to infect humans. But for now if you see a so-called “zombie squirrel,” there’s no reason to run from it like you would from a human zombie, unless, of course, you happen to be a giant acorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we talk about “gut health,” we’re really talking about the gut microbiome—the trillions of microorganisms in your digestive tract. This community doesn’t just affect digestion, it also influences your metabolism, immune system, hormones and even brain function. “Recent research shows that a balanced microbiome supports nutrient absorption, hormone and neurotransmitter production and more,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists/tami-best" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tami Best, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in nutrition and gut health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dianamesa.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diana Mesa, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt; says legumes are one of her favorite prebiotic sources—and this recipe puts chickpeas to work. They’re tossed with oil, paprika and salt, then roasted until crispy to pair with salmon and kale. Have extras? &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259418/crunchy-roasted-chickpeas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; make a tasty snack on their own or a crunchy salad topping the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This dish also incorporates kale, which also helps to support your gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The recipe calls for cooking it on the stovetop for a warm side, but you can serve it chilled if you’d prefer something more refreshing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Offer Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe includes a creamy green dressing to top the salmon and greens. One source of the dressing’s creaminess is buttermilk, an ingredient that sometimes (but not always) contains probiotics. (Check the label for live and active cultures.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sure if your buttermilk contains probiotics, it’s also easy to add probiotics by using plain yogurt instead of buttermilk or mayonnaise in the recipe. Or, you can swap the dressing and make this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7917202/creamy-yogurt-dill-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Yogurt-Dill Sauce&lt;/a&gt; instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anti-Inflammatory Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe incorporates a few anti-inflammatory ingredients that Best recommends, including green leafy veggies, fatty fish and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8003928/regular-vs-extra-virgin-olive-oil-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt;. “Anti-inflammatory foods help keep intestinal cells healthy,” says Best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the chickpeas are seasoned with paprika, a spice that may have anti-inflammatory benefits due to its capsaicin content. Capsaicin is responsible for the spicy flavor of foods like paprika and chile peppers. Research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;capsaicin may help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stimulate mucin production in the colon, which supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-gut-health-friendly-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Gut-Health-Friendly Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A gut-healthy dinner includes more than just one superstar ingredient—it’s about combining the right foods and habits. Here are the key things to keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotic-Rich Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are good-for-you live bacteria that help populate your gut for a healthy microbiome. We still need more research to learn if or when &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt; are beneficial, so getting probiotics from food sources is especially important.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find probiotics in foods such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, miso, kefir&lt;/a&gt; and some brands of cottage cheese. Yogurt is another great probiotic-rich food that can be incorporated into dinner—Mesa recommends that it can be used as a base for a dressing or marinade or dolloped onto a bowl of soup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prebiotic Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is great for gut health—especially if it’s a specific type called prebiotic fiber, which acts as food for the healthy bacteria in your gut, allowing them to thrive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The bacteria in your gut ferment prebiotic fiber, releasing byproducts such as gases and short-chain fatty acids,” says Mesa. “Short-chain fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, which are not only beneficial to gut health but to overall health, too,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;The prebiotic foods&lt;/a&gt; that Best recommends include whole grains, peas, legumes, artichokes, garlic, honey, asparagus, banana, dandelion greens and onions. Mesa says she loves incorporating potatoes, legumes or plantains in her dinners for prebiotic fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Plant Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a gut-friendly dinner, make sure you’re packing in the plants. One study ifound that people who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; rich in plant foods had significantly more diverse gut microbiomes than those who ate a typical Western diet low in fiber and high in added sugars and animal products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The researchers believe antioxidants—found in abundance in plant foods—may have something to do with this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Low-Stress Environment &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health is about more than just the nutrients you eat. It’s also about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you eat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; can promote nervous system regulation and help your body enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921263/can-stress-cause-diarrhea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;“rest and digest” mode&lt;/a&gt; for optimal digestion. In fact, research on mindfulness-based stress reduction has shown robust improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms among people with IBS, with benefits linked to the ability to stay present and eat with awareness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try eating dinner in a low-stress environment. Set aside enough time so you’re not rushed, and aim to eat regularly during the day so you don’t arrive at dinner overly hungry. This gives you the chance to chew your food well. “Digestion begins in the mouth, and in the hustle and bustle of daily life, you might find yourself eating quickly,” says Mesa. Slowing down and chewing thoroughly can support digestion and make meals more enjoyable, she adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a healthy gut, it’s important to eat prebiotics, probiotics and anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish and leafy greens. The best dinner that fits the bill is our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262763/roasted-salmon-with-smoky-chickpeas-greens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Salmon with Smoky Chickpeas &amp;amp; Greens&lt;/a&gt;. To support healthy digestion, experts recommend eating it slowly in a stress-free environment, too. Besides, with a dinner this good, you’ll want to savor and enjoy it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOdDV3cWFQd1MzQXVIUjF3d1RoY1dVeWVadXBKWDRkczM0a3JjY2x3TUh2LUU3S0JWa0lGaXlMMGpGYS1tQVVVdU5Jd0FCdk9NRTI5anFUWEZteWE0OU5oTXB2OTF2MmRZVlAwS1Fac2VjWmI4bnJXRUdXWXZLckZ4ZTl5b3J0NnJM</guid></item></channel></rss>
