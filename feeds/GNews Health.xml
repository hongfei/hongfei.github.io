While our bodies may reach their peak in early adulthood, evidence now suggests that the brain continues to develop and can perform at its highest level much later in life. Understanding when cognitive and emotional abilities peak offers a fresh perspective on aging, productivity, and leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Intelligence, led by Gilles E. Gignac, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Australia, examined a wide range of psychological traits that influence real-world performance. The research focused on core cognitive abilities—including reasoning, memory span, processing speed, knowledge, and emotional intelligence—as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124640846" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that several traits reach their highest levels later in life. Conscientiousness tends to peak around age 65, while emotional stability may not reach its maximum until approximately 75. Overall psychological functioning appears to crest between ages 55 and 60, before gradually declining from the mid-sixties and more sharply after age 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wisdom and Moral Reasoning Improve With Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond personality traits, the study also highlights cognitive skills often overlooked in discussions of aging. Moral reasoning and the ability to resist cognitive biases—mental shortcuts that can distort judgment—frequently continue to strengthen into the seventies and eighties. Gignac noted that these improvements may explain why demanding leadership positions in business, politics, and other fields are frequently held by individuals in their fifties and early sixties. While certain abilities like processing speed may decline with age, gains in judgment, perspective, and decision-making help balance these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124640846" id="div-vdoai-mid-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124640846" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Age Should Not Define Capability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these positive findings, older adults still face challenges in the workforce. Age discrimination persists, even though the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects workers aged 40 and above. According to a survey by résumé-building platform Resume Now, nearly 90% of employees over 40 reported experiencing workplace ageism, with roughly half indicating that employers favor younger candidates. Some professions, such as airline pilots and air traffic controllers, enforce mandatory retirement ages due to the high cognitive demands of these roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings challenge societal assumptions about aging. History shows that many notable achievements occurred in midlife or later. Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species at 50, Beethoven premiered his Ninth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/symphony-ltd/stocks/companyid-10473.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;Symphony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at 53 while profoundly deaf, and contemporary leaders like Lisa Su have delivered significant professional breakthroughs in their fifties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gignac emphasizes that cognitive ability varies widely among individuals, and evaluations should rely on actual performance rather than age assumptions. He encourages age-inclusive hiring and retention practices, reminding society that significant achievements often occur well past what is traditionally considered “peak age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend lifestyle measures to support long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/brain-health" target="_blank"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and fish, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and continuous learning can all help maintain cognitive functioning well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical performance typically peaks in early adulthood, usually between ages 25 and 35, researchers note that mental and emotional abilities follow a different timeline. Rather than declining with age, key psychological traits continue developing well into middle and late adulthood. Experts also emphasize that while genetics play a role in how the brain ages, lifestyle factors make a significant difference. Regular mental challenges—such as learning new languages, playing strategic games, or engaging in creative pursuits—can help sustain memory and reasoning skills. Combined with healthy habits, these activities may delay cognitive decline and enhance overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights how perceptions of aging often fail to match scientific evidence. Society tends to associate getting older with decline, yet data suggests that many individuals continue to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/excel-realty-n-infra-ltd/stocks/companyid-29124.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;excel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in complex thinking and emotional understanding well into their later years. Researchers believe that shifting public attitudes about age could not only reduce workplace discrimination but also encourage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/lifelong-learning" target="_blank"&gt;lifelong learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and engagement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 01:42:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9AFBVV95cUxNUXIyZVNFYmppYkxOYVhsY2lJTDVtU19FaEQ4aG5iYzFtVHdkTTEwcURqeHFUdk5jeVRHNzBzVU9qOVl2MU1ELUVkR21yN1Z5emFmWEFJWVlKMnRRRndJaWpEWlV6NnFjelNJSExsX3ExS044cHpybEFJMWtYRjlfSWhzUEhxTzZ5TXNKTmgyX2tVV0VxcElFaGNnSklvVGdwVE1BbGVsRUV2d2N2STRrMGR6eEVIcWUxZ05fRnlVUUc5a3dNSENPM0s3bWFNLTE3RjNCWXhsb2V4eWtTX0stS2tkZXJQLWk0eTBnUFB1U0pBdXlZ</guid></item><item><title>第一个抗抑郁药副作用排行榜- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d65nqgd5zo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Effects of antidepressants on physical health ranked for first time&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-c4820dd1-0 cYDsPh"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-c4820dd1-11 bxdaHR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-c4820dd1-5 iYeVyy"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-c4820dd1-7 dbQBRo"&gt;James Gallagher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="undefined-role-location" class="sc-c4820dd1-8 evcqcz"&gt;Health and science correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 ERpRj"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61da/live/cd0dd240-ade0-11f0-8623-dd1b3d489f0f.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Young woman is sat with a glass of water in one hand and a white tablet in the open palm of the other.

Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Fluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was "impossible" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, he said there had been a push for "generic, cheap medications" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said implementing the findings of this report would see "the 85% reduce dramatically" with "more people accessing better treatments".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The researchers are developing &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psymatik.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;a free online tool&lt;/a&gt; to help doctors and patients choose the right drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment.

But many people in their 60s, 70s and beyond may struggle for a variety of reasons to maintain the step count they used to reach. Until now it has been unclear how much people need to do as they age to reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research led by Harvard University has some answers. The large prospective study examined not only how many steps older people took but how often they reached step targets across the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers found achieving 4,000 steps per day on one or two days a week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death and lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared with not reaching this level on any day. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2025-110311" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study followed 13,547 American women over 62, with 72 the average age. They wore activity trackers for seven consecutive days between 2011 and 2015 and were followed for over a decade. None had heart disease or cancer at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the monitoring period to the end of 2024, 1,765 women died and 781 developed heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clocking up at least 4,000 steps a day on one or two days of the week was associated with a 26% lower risk of death from all causes and a 27% lower risk of dying from heart disease, compared with not reaching this threshold on any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those achieving this step count on at least three days of the week, the lower risk of death from any cause increased to 40%, but remained at 27% for the risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers said the important takeaway was that it is the amount people walk, rather than the number of days on which they achieve a certain number of steps, that is most important for reducing the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no “best” way to take your steps, they added. The key thing is just to get your steps in. They concluded that a “greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On average, the women took 5,615 steps a day. This was an observational study, and as such no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. There were also several limitations to the research, notably that physical activity was assessed for only one week, and only in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers wrote: “The present study … suggests that frequency of meeting daily step thresholds is not critical (even 1to 2 days a week of [more than] 4,000 steps a day was related to lower mortality and CVD), and that step volume is more important than the frequency of meeting daily step thresholds in the older population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They added: “An important translational implication of these findings is that since step volume is the important driver of the inverse associations, there is no ‘better’ or ‘best’ pattern to take steps; individuals can undertake [physical activity] in any preferred pattern (eg ‘slow and steady’ v ‘bunched patterns’) for lower mortality and CVD risk, at least among older women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They concluded: “These findings provide additional evidence for considering including step metrics in the next [physical activity] guidelines, and that ‘bunching’ steps is a viable option for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 22:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOOVFsNkMycFFsZGRmTW5CdUhhV0owa2V1VDRyWGJRSDZwa1cxN1h2WTlPTW0tR2VQQkZQWVd6SlhjOHJBVTdqaWNQLURHT2ZaY210XzR3czNTQkRjWTdUWk5rMDNKU0pMT053dG05aFlZaGNvcmNRX0xobk9yYnJXaXVzUVh6eXdwYlpjWmdfT1VBNTd1aVFMUURsWEJSeXlOVU13ZjdPVUwzSXd6bUE</guid></item><item><title>调查发现， 90%的成年人面临着大多数人从未听说过的健康状况风险- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/2025/10/90-of-adults-are-at-risk-for-health-condition-most-have-never-heard-of-survey-finds.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="INYEC7YBJFE6DPMLPBEDMKHLHY"&gt;About 9 in 10 U.S. adults have not heard of health condition that affects nearly 90% of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VLAUUWOTORCYRGUBJFK4EQUVGQ"&gt;That’s the word from the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults"&gt;which surveyed about 4,000 people&lt;/a&gt; on their awareness of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a newly defined health condition that includes heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="44LLYLWN6JCUXJUE3M34WHGG64"&gt;Most U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome including high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FIGJ7KUCRVGI3OEGRTJDTZCKGM"&gt;The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="367MJGK5IFGKTHGYPBL35ISEY4"&gt;Fortunately, most CKM risks are reversible with changes to their eating pattern, physical activity and appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EC2DNO4EV5BALNCFGUIMVSWVTQ"&gt;“We want people to know that it’s really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time.

&lt;p&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy will begin publishing “public health alerts” in the coming month, CIDRAP Director Michael Osterholm &lt;a href="https://idweek2025.eventscribe.net/aaStatic.asp?SFP=WldXSkRZU0dAMjQyMjY#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced at the IDWeek conference&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alerts “will basically serve to be a way to convey the information that once was shared in the MMWR with all of us in a very timely way,” he said at the opening plenary of the conference of infectious disease specialists, according to a recording shared with STAT. “We encourage all of you to begin thinking about submissions of outbreaks or data you think should be evaluated. So, I hope you’ll help participate in that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for NEJM said the alerts would be published in a new section of its NEJM Evidence journal as needed — as opposed to being published on a weekly basis — and be made available for free. “In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more information on a new, rapid digital alert to disseminate essential data on disease outbreaks and other issues of public health importance,” created in partnership with CIDRAP, she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MMWR has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published weekly since 1952&lt;/a&gt; and has become part of the bedrock of public health; historically it’s been where details of new outbreaks and emerging diseases are first reported. But many public health practitioners’ trust in the publication has been shaken. In the earliest days of the Trump administration, new articles could not be published because of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administrations-cancels-scientific-meetings-abruptly/"&gt;communications pause&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first time in the journal’s history that it &lt;a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/lets-hope-the-mmwr-resumes-publication-sooner-rather-than-later/2025/01/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;missed publishing a new edition&lt;/a&gt;. Weekly editions have been paused again during the government shutdown, and earlier this month, much of the team behind the journal was laid off before &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;being reinstated hours later&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Kent, the journal’s former editor-in-chief, left the agency in February. She &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;previously told STAT&lt;/a&gt; that administration officials were pressuring the journal to change the way it reports information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told STAT the agency “is committed to the MMWR as the nation’s trusted, science-driven source for timely and accurate health information.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CIDRAP has begun taking on tasks that have generally been done by the federal government. In April, the center &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project-help-safeguard-us-vaccine-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;created the Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, which has put out parallel vaccine recommendations to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. Several professional societies, including the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, have adopted the Vaccine Integrity Project’s recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Osterholm said more is to come from CIDRAP as it aims to shore up public health infrastructure at a moment when political support is scarce. His center, he said, turned to private foundations to secure funding for eight graduate students. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We all understand it’s hard to do anything without resources. I am here tonight to actually report to you that there are a series of activities ongoing, and I’m involved with several of them, where more than 65 foundations are going to be pooling their resources to give out in a way to protect science,” he said at the conference. “This is a very critical time that the philanthropic world has to take a very different look at what they do and how they do it. It can’t be business as usual. … Tonight I am happy to report to you we will be following up with you in the near future not just with words but with dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;

                Researchers say fewer children developed peanut allergies after guidelines were put into place calling for introducing peanut products to young children.

   &lt;p&gt;For years, parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts, to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. But 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;a landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;a new study published&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Early allergen introduction works," Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. "For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1500186" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence," Hill says, "and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;research was published&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack&lt;/a&gt; called Bamba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The revised recommendations, including in the&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more" in the past decade, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called &lt;a href="https://www.leapstudy.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt; (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's highly persistent," Hill says. "Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy."&lt;/p&gt;

The team sequenced semen samples from individuals between the ages of 24 and 75, using very high-precision technologies, and found that the male germ line (the line of cells that produce sperm) is subject to a combination of mutation and positive selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists used a duplex sequencing technique called NanoSeq, which can detect rare mutations with a very low margin of error. This allowed them to analyze 81 sperm samples from 57 donors. The results showed that a man's sperm adds an average of 1.67 new mutations every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But the most striking aspect of the study is not limited to the mere accumulation of mutations with age. The authors discovered that the male germ line is subject to positive selection. That is, certain mutations offer an advantage to cells that produce sperm and expand. They identified that many of these mutations are in genes related to developmental disorders or a predisposition to childhood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;"We expected to find evidence that selection influences mutations in sperm," said Matthew Neville, coauthor of the study published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09448-3"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature. "What surprised us was how much the number of sperm carrying mutations associated with serious diseases increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;What Does This Mean for Children of Older Fathers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers estimated that about 3 to 5 percent of sperm from middle-aged and older men carry some potentially pathogenic mutation in the exome (the coding part of the genome). That represents a higher risk than previous estimates. In more concrete numbers, the estimated fraction for men in their thirties was close to 2 percent, while it reached about 4.5 percent for men in their seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;From the evolutionary and clinical perspective, the implications are significant. Evolutionarily, it shows that the male germ line is not simply a "machine" that accumulates errors: There is a dynamic process of mutation and selection that can modify the genetic “quality” of the sperm with the age of the father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On the clinical side, however, it raises questions about reproductive planning, genetic counseling, and the additional risks associated with an older father. The authors argue that although the percentages remain modest, the the accumulation is not only linear but also has a selection component that favors mutations with the potential to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 18:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQNXhTdWxCQkk1ZDJzLTU2SkVMcFZuSzhyTk9veW15ZDRuRThGdHpSQzY0YnZNQ3ZsVjBaTVZ6elVHcVdLcEk4bW5XTHZaZ2ZERGsyTi12QTZ6V0FWZmtSRGN1Qy1WR29YUGNkN2lVXzZ2MlplTzZoMzd5WnhRUHl0Sm80TQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现了一种可以帮助头发再生的化学物质。它可能在你的储藏室里。-男性健康</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69110621/stevia-hair-regrowth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="1" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="1.0"&gt;Minoxidil, the active medical ingredient in products like Rogaine, is a well-known treatment for hair loss, but has poor water solubility and skin permeability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="1.1"&gt;A new study combines minoxidil with a microneedle that uses stevioside, a naturally occurring sweetener from the &lt;em data-node-id="1.1.1"&gt;Stevia&lt;/em&gt; plant.&lt;em data-node-id="1.1.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="1.2"&gt;Tested on mouse models, scientists found that seviosides increased the absorption of minoxidil, which helped boost the medicine’s overall effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="2" class="css-1xkwtv6 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="body-dropcap css-1xzgd0b emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="3.0"&gt;Few people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="3.1.0"&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a66016637/baldness-cure-pp405/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a66016637/baldness-cure-pp405/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="going bald" data-node-id="3.2" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;going bald&lt;/a&gt;—there’s a reason why hair growth is a multi-billion industry. One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="50 percent of both men and women" data-node-id="3.4" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;50 percent of both men and women&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication’s absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it’s derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sweetener" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; derived from the &lt;em data-node-id="7.3"&gt;Stevia&lt;/em&gt; plant.

Brain scans revealed increased levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down the brain’s “bliss molecule,” anandamide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance means less natural mood regulation and greater vulnerability to stress and relapse. The findings uncover a potential biological target for treating cannabis use disorder, especially in those who co-use tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Brain Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Co-use of cannabis and tobacco increased FAAH levels, reducing the “bliss molecule” anandamide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The imbalance may explain higher anxiety, depression, and relapse risk among co-users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying this mechanism could guide the development of targeted medications for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who use both cannabis and tobacco show distinct brain changes compared to those who use cannabis alone, according to a new study led by McGill University researchers at the Douglas Research Centre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding may help explain why people who use both cannabis and tobacco often report increased depression and anxiety, and why quitting cannabis is harder for them than for people only using cannabis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first evidence in humans of a molecular mechanism that may underlie why people who use both cannabis and tobacco experience worse outcomes,” said lead author Rachel Rabin, Associate Professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this mechanism is an important step toward finding targets for future medications to treat cannabis use disorder, especially among those that co-use tobacco. Right now, the only available treatments are behavioural therapies such as counselling,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Canada, about one in 20 people who used cannabis in the past year are considered at risk for cannabis use disorder. That figure rises to one in three among people who use it more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tobacco-smoking rates are declining overall, most people who use cannabis also use tobacco, the researchers note. Most studies have looked at cannabis and tobacco in isolation, Rabin added, leaving a gap that this preliminary study begins to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifts in brain’s ‘bliss molecule’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET brain scans revealed that people who used both tobacco and cannabis had higher levels of FAAH, relative to people who only used cannabis. FAAH is the enzyme that breaks down anandamide, a naturally occurring molecule sometimes called the “bliss molecule” for its role in mood and stress regulation. More FAAH means less anandamide, a pattern previously linked to anxiety, depression and relapse when trying to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed scans from 13 young adults. Eight smoked only cannabis, while five also smoked cigarettes daily. Cannabis users averaged just over one gram per day, while cigarette use ranged from one to 12 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the data was originally collected for another study, the research did not include a tobacco-only group. So it’s possible tobacco alone caused the changes. However, the researchers say the results suggest something more is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised us was how strong the effect was, and how different it was from those who only used cannabis, compared to those who used both tobacco and cannabis,” said co-author Romina Mizrahi, Professor of Psychiatry and director of the McGill Research Centre for Cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now recruiting people who smoke cigarettes and people who vape nicotine in a new study to test whether the same brain changes occur without cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study received funding form the National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059119906"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about the effects of smoking tobacco and cannabis together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: People who use both cannabis and tobacco show higher levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down anandamide, which is linked to mood regulation and addiction resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059162464"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The altered brain chemistry could explain why co-users often face greater mental health challenges and find it harder to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059180210"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What comes next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Scientists are now testing whether similar brain changes occur in people who smoke or vape nicotine without cannabis, to isolate the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dfd1ddd8d59ad0d1c4d5c4d1f4d9d7d3ddd8d89ad7d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2025.100369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;” by Rachel Rabin et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco is commonly co-used with cannabis. This is unfortunate because tobacco co-use exacerbates select clinical consequences associated with cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence demonstrates that low levels of anandamide, a prominent endocannabinoid, correlate with worse clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) degrades anandamide, and greater FAAH levels may underlie poorer clinical outcomes in people who co-use relative to those who use only cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we tested whether tobacco co-use increases FAAH levels beyond those associated with cannabis use alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis-using participants (N = 13) were parsed into individuals with daily tobacco use (CT, n = 5) and no current tobacco use (CAN, n = 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated group differences in FAAH, quantified using positron emission tomography and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CURB, while controlling for sex and FAAH genotype in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, sensorimotor striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebellum.

&lt;p&gt;And Dengue in California:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is investigating the year's first case of locally acquired &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5159" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;dengue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in a San Gabriel Valley resident. The patient, who became ill in late September and is recovering, reported no travel to areas endemic for the mosquito-borne infection. Last year was the first year LA reported local dengue, with 14 cases. The risk of widespread dengue virus transmission in Los Angeles County is low, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Cambodia again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cambodia yesterday announced its 16th H5N1 avian flu case of the year, the first since &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodia-announces-15th-human-h5n1-infection-year" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;early August&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, according to a Cambodia Ministry of Health press release translated and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/10/cambodian-moh-announces-16th-h5n1-case.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;posted today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. The patient is a 3-year-old girl from Kampong Speu province who is in intensive care. Chickens and ducks in the patient's home and in neighboring houses had been sick and dying for roughly a week when the child became ill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The latest human cases in the country have involved a reassortant (2.3.2.1e) between an older H5N1 clade that has circulated in Cambodia since 2014 and the newer clade 2.3.4.4b virus that is circulating globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first locally acquired case of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/first-locally-acquired-us-case-more-severe-clade-1-mpox-identified-california" target="_blank"&gt;Clade 1 mpox&lt;/a&gt; was reported in Long Beach, California. Previous cases had all been travel-related.  And now &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/3rd-case-locally-acquired-clade-1-mpox-california-officials-warn-community-spread" target="_blank"&gt;There are 3.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the good news is that &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/last-ebola-patient-dr-congo-discharged-countdown-end-outbreak-starts" target="_blank"&gt;The last case in the DRC outbreak of Ebola&lt;/a&gt; is being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of good news about vaccines.  &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/study-finds-no-link-between-mrna-covid-vaccines-early-pregnancy-and-birth-defects" target="_blank"&gt;No link between Covid vaccine in pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and any of the 75 birth defects they studied.  The Southern Hemispere flu vaccine was about &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/protection-flu-vaccine-around-50-southern-hemisphere-data-reveal" target="_blank"&gt;50% effective&lt;/a&gt;, and this year's Northern Hemisphere formula will be the same, so probably equally effective.  Never super good, not with a slippery virus like flu.  But always helpful.  Covid mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-mrna-vaccines-may-be-able-train-immune-system-attack-cancer-cells-boost-survival" target="_blank"&gt;Appear to help the immune system fight cancers&lt;/a&gt;.  And shingles vaccine, more than other vaccines it was compared to, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/shingles-vaccine-tied-significant-reductions-risk-dementia-heart-disease-and" target="_blank"&gt;Significantly reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia, heart disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

Such events happen every day as medicine progresses, but this one stands out because “enteral ventilation” is more popularly known as “butt-breathing” or a few other names you can probably fill in for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dna-discovery-signals-a-bum-breathing-turtles-survival-63657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Australian turtle species&lt;/a&gt; have found a way to delay the dangers of coming to the surface to breathe by extracting oxygen dissolved in water using their &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-its-so-damn-hard-to-tell-the-sex-of-a-dinosaur-79503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cloaca&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, they have gill-like features in their bums that supplement their oxygen intake. &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dragonfly-babies-breathe-through-their-butts-but-thats-not-all-76934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-pasted="true"&gt;Dragonfly nymphs do something similar&lt;/a&gt;, and even expel the water afterwards as a form of jet propulsion. This, however, is Australia, and you can probably find seventeen weirder animal behaviors within a stone’s throw of a butt-breathing turtle (arguably including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-endangered-turtle-breathes-out-of-its-butt-and-is-one-of-the-most-evolutionarily-distinct-reptiles-on-the-planet-47107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their headwear&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical applications were probably not the first thing on the mind of those who discovered the trait. However, sick of watching patients struggle for breath with various lung conditions, and inspired by loaches (fish that process air through their stomachs), Dr Takanori Takebe of the Institute of Science, Tokyo, proposed to take an algal leaf out of the turtles’ book. Inevitably, the work was awarded the 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dead-trout-swimming-and-pigeon-missiles-2024-ig-nobel-prizes-are-outrageous-as-ever-75943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ig Nobel physiology prize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pigs-and-rodents-can-breathe-through-their-rectums-so-we-probably-can-too-59716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;demonstrating the viability&lt;/a&gt; of mammals being able to breathe through their butts on some no doubt surprised pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the challenges of getting taken seriously, Takebe has ploughed ahead, and the first results are promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takebe stressed in a &lt;a href="https://scienceblog.cincinnatichildrens.org/ignobel-butt-breathing-idea-from-2024-moves-closer-to-real-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reptiles’ metabolisms are so much slower than those of mammals that they need far less oxygen, so it is perhaps unsurprising that they can get useful amounts this way. Even then, no known turtle species can rely entirely on this approach for their oxygen needs, the highest being about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Takebe and colleagues knew they couldn’t just blow some air up a patient’s ass to keep their blood oxygenated. Their approach is to create a liquid rich in dissolved oxygen, much like deep-sea divers used in the science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, but provide it anally for absorption through the colon. After all, if nutrients can make their way from the intestine straight to the blood, why not oxygen? The liquid, perfluorodecalin, can hold 40-50 times as much oxygen by volume as can be dissolved in water, and about twice as much as human blood holds, but releases it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the idea actually requires less advanced technology than mechanical ventilators when lungs are failing, and so might be available in remote regions or where finances are more limited. Moreover, ventilators can cause lung injuries, with long-term consequences for the short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, 27 healthy Japanese men were administered perfluorodecalin liquid rectally and asked to hold it for 60 minutes. Quantities were increased through the trial, in some cases reaching a liter and a half of the liquid. Twenty of the 27 reached the 60-minute goal, and while those on the larger amounts reported some discomfort and abdominal bloating, there were no serious side effects, nor detectable absorption of the liquid. Discomfort appeared to have been associated with not having defecated during the previous 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="87126" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;People have yet to breathe through their butts, but the study showed the carrier liquid is safe, making a first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Med&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, this was just a safety test, and the perfluorodecalin was not carrying oxygen. Trials using an oxygenated version of the liquid will be next, still on healthy volunteers. If these are similarly successful, the team will move on to those struggling to breathe. They hope the work will be particularly useful for newborns whose lungs are not yet operating properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2313680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1.5 million critically ill adults&lt;/a&gt; undergoing tracheal intubation each year in the USA alone, 10-20 percent of whom suffer damagingly low oxygen levels, there is the potential for widespread demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the way influencers try to turn everything into a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fibermaxxing-valid-health-hack-or-a-fast-pass-to-flatulence-80291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wellness trend&lt;/a&gt;, we do have some concerns, however, and would rather not be around when yoga instructors encourage participants to “breathe out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are expensive, and gaining funding is always a struggle, but that challenge has increased exponentially this year. Takebe is taking advantage of the publicity the work attracts to seek funds, and said that the better that goes, the faster research can progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Med&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:43:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQUlRybnFNa1VFdElJQWVxeDduTVB4QnVpQXV5VEZjSTVBSlBYbGJnOElBcXVKRjQ1OEVzSnZpUHVIUEVUUHh0WHRoWnVlbFZXcmM3TFBmS3lvalpiLTFKTEI1UVBmQzAxRE4wX181ZF96Z1NPaHFBWkxsR1J2dGZkNi1FWFY3czdPQ1RJaXZDYm80ajRiMHZxeDVYLXdjekJTVExvRXhycEhORENXbVF1RDhn</guid></item><item><title>数百万女性经历更年期副作用，但不要谈论... “大规模系统故障” -《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15209505/menopause-symptoms-word-retirement-earnings-pay-hormones.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women bracing for &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-09820820-ade8-11f0-a9c9-05d8e0323bf3"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; know to prepare for the hot flashes, mood swings and brain fog, but another side effect of 'the change' occurs outside of the body - and it is rarely spoken about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New research from scientists in Norway and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/sweden/index.html" id="mol-3e98a190-aded-11f0-8a76-4f8cca87e1db"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; has found that a woman's career, specifically her pay, suffers once menopause sets in. The financial penalty from menopause begins at diagnosis and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12487881/Largest-review-menopause-dozens-alleged-therapies-bogus.html"&gt;intensifies over time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The physiological and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6288057/Why-ANXIETY-reaches-time-high-menopause-6-tips-ease-pain.html"&gt;psychological effects of menopause&lt;/a&gt; are being studied in greater depth, but far less is known about the economics of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopause's economic toll is most severe for women without a college degree, especially those in small, private-sector firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The penalty is also amplified for those working in the private sector, particularly in smaller companies and teams with a high proportion of older female colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kacy Fleming, a psychologist and founder of The Fuchsia Tent, a firm dedicated to women's workplace well-being, told the Daily Mail: ‘The 10 percent earnings drop in symptomatic peri/menopausal women reveals a massive system failing; both healthcare and organizations need to step up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Norway, a menopause diagnosis led to a 10 percent reduction in earnings within four years, a consequence of women scaling back their hours or leaving their careers early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scale of this ‘menopause penalty’ was comparable to other major economic setbacks, such as job displacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Menopause doesn't just lead to sick days; it forces permanent work reductions. This is proven by a sharp rise in women relying on disability insurance, which drives the persistent earnings drop (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Darisse, COO and General Counsel of The HRT Club, which creates and sells effective and affordable hormone replacement therapy (HRT), told the Daily Mail: 'These new economic figures highlight a persistent, sad reality: women are often stigmatized for experiencing symptoms like hot flashes and their visible effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Workplaces must create an environment of understanding and support, helping women thrive rather than feel sidelined during this natural life stage.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stanford researchers used Scandinavian population data to demonstrate that menopause directly causes a loss of earnings. By comparing newly diagnosed women to their undiagnosed peers, they isolated menopause as the cause of the economic penalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 20 percent of the US labor force are women nearing or in menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Swedish natural experiment included in the Stanford report proved that timely diagnosis and HRT treatment can prevent economic loss. When women accessed care, their earnings losses were significantly smaller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For women who did not receive adequate treatment, earnings fall by 10 percent within four years, driven by a steady reduction in work hours and exits from the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study confirmed the penalty is preventable. When women received timely treatment like HRT, they had less earnings losses, proving the economic toll is a direct result of inadequate healthcare and support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their study was &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;by the Stanford University Institute for Economic Policy Research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Figure A shows a persistent decline in employment post-diagnosis, indicating a long-term workforce detachment. Figure B confirms a sustained reduction in work hours, proving the earnings penalty hits on both the extensive (leaving jobs) and intensive (reducing hours) margins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming added: 'With women responsible for roughly 80 percent of consumer spending power, this downtrend in our income does not bode well for the global economy.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopause marks the end of a woman's reproductive years through a significant decline in key hormones. This change generates a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep disruption and cognitive difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a universal experience for women who live long enough, its timing, duration and severity are unique to each woman, creating a highly personal yet universal health evolution.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the US workplace offers no safety net for menopause, forcing some women to rely on disability insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Petra Persson, a faculty fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) who led the research &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'We have parental leave policies, and we have policies that support workers when their productivity dips for health reasons, so it makes sense to also have policies that help women during the menopause transition.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The chart shows the symptoms reported by 374 women in a 2023 study by American public health researchers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lack of accommodations or resources for women in menopause forces experienced employees to cut hours or leave careers due to a lack of basic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming said: ‘By not providing adequate support for midlife women, companies are basically throwing 20 years of strategic thinking, organizational knowledge, and problem solving out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From a lost productivity perspective, the numbers are staggering; we're looking at $150 billion in global productivity losses and over $600 billion in healthcare costs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She argued that the disability exit path frames menopause as an individual's failing, burdening the woman and absolving the company of support, despite the condition being highly treatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming said: ‘It's maddening when we know that most hormone replacement therapies have been around for years and cost pennies on the dollar.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amy Epstein Gluck, a workplace compliance and ADA expert who chairs the Employment practice at Pierson Ferdinand, told the Daily Mail: ‘For women, symptoms of perimenopause or menopause often begin when they are at the top of their game and at the peak of their earning years, which can derail them without accommodations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gluck said: ‘While menopause, alone, is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), its symptoms can lead to limitations on major life activities that warrant accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If employers don’t offer some practical accommodations like temperature control, flexible scheduling, remote options, rest breaks, leave for treatment, role modifications, workers with treatable menopause symptoms may still be pushed toward disability rather than supported to remain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Fleming added: ‘It's not the biology that's disabling; it's the lack of information, treatment access and workplace support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZ2QwdkZIZUZZNldsYWVrUExyM3o3SlZTaXdoX21PTEdxRThHaEtFQ3RlendyOG9KSTl5YkU1b1NhZEZyc3RXM09GSk92SW1wSXpwdVFfcWxiLW1OSWhiUXlHenZleVNWSlZRdHZJY0ktYV91ajVNNENnYkM5ZWtadGRCTkdNcHc4eFIxVm1LM0ZXVUhMbkh3MUFjMW9zb0F2Ny1meENfdm9WX1Y5ZFNRUGxWRdIBuAFBVV95cUxPN0RZSjJTUTRhWVdnTnpiUlh1MjMzeTZKMjJDXzdkaFZ0YXJoNjNEVWpOLUZfS0wyemVsallCem44VnBDSGpoNldNWmdLdWpLTWp5aFZMQ0xnQzltbjNsRDY5UDlVeGhlRVBsWGZyUlcwdll4NWZQSDBrMC1KcGRsQk9MTUk4WmFyRnhNeWFDeE44ajl6N2IybEwtdnh2V29kaVpKdHJYSE1rN2JlZElSQWpFbXhKbXhr</guid></item><item><title>一位老龄化专家揭示了真正导致长寿幸福生活的原因- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/aging-expert-reveals-really-leads-123000899.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Emily Lachtrupp, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design elements: Getty Images.

Through her time running programs, offering counseling and visiting seniors in their homes and at hospitals, she’s observed an abundance of examples of what it truly means to age well—and what can hold people back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like to say that I have a front row seat to what healthy aging looks like and what unhealthy aging looks like,” the gerontologist tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. “It's been very, very educational for me personally and professionally, because I've gotten to know thousands and thousands of older adults through working at a very active senior center.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on those experiences, DiGiovanna distilled her philosophy into three simple but powerful principles: activating yourself, adulting and accepting new realities. She calls them the “three As of healthy aging,” and she explains how to prioritize these core elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Activating Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGiovanna emphasizes that healthy adults are continually “activating” themselves through physical movement, connection and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to make it an actual concerted effort to be socializing, to be physically active, to be just really into what we now call ‘self-care,’ because those things don’t happen automatically or accidentally,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her expert take is backed by science. According to a recent study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;, higher social engagement was linked with lower all-cause mortality. More social activity could mean joining a walking group, attending a fitness class at a senior center, hosting neighborhood potlucks or signing up for a book club. It could also be as simple as catching up with family and friends face-to-face on a more regular basis. These things build accountability, structure and joy, all factors that lead to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of older adults will say to me, ‘Well, I'm not a joiner, I've never been a joiner.’ That’s not a good thing,” DiGiovanna shares. “It is good to enjoy your own company, being alone sometimes, but I would say not being a ‘joiner' is going to work against you when you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adulting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, “adulting” feels pretty obvious, but it’s more than it seems. You may be guilty of not filling out and finalizing the necessary paperwork while in the midst of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even begin to tell you how many people who are older, in their 80s or 90s, that still haven’t done a will or a trust, or a healthcare directive, or even told anyone what they want when they die,” DiGiovanna says. “Do they want to be buried or cremated? These are very important things that a lot of times cause more grief for whoever's left than the person themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may initially feel uncomfortable, these tasks are practical steps to fully embrace aging and life ahead. If you haven’t done so already, this is your reminder to file a will, consider a financial power of attorney, complete a healthcare directive and to talk to your family about the future. And DiGiovanna practices what she preaches, noting that she has completed the check list of healthy aging tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once I did all of those things, it felt great,” DiGiovanna, who is 64 herself, shares. “It feels wonderful to tell your loved ones, ‘This is done, I’ve talked to you about my wishes.’ It’s a peaceful feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accepting New Realities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the hardest of the bunch, but it’s inevitable—and accepting and adjusting your routine to highlight your needs is a healthy way to welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing certain is change,” DiGiovanna notes. “We’re going to continue to change our whole lives.” The expert shares that she sees individuals every day who resist aging by trying to deny their abilities. But straining your body might be doing you more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; found that older adults who were able to cope with life challenges through more resilience had a reduced mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGiovanna stresses that acceptance doesn’t mean giving up, contrary to popular belief. It means adapting to your needs, whether that be taking specialized exercise classes or focusing on the simple things in life that spark you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People that accept and say, ‘You know what, I am a senior,’ they have that openness and that curiosity, that's much more healthy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is all about flowing with time instead of fighting it.

They seem to have more appreciation that they're alive now, that they have the ability to still do some things. So that acceptance piece, I feel, is a very big part of healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside activity, socialization and focusing on your mental health, you can support healthy aging through your diet.

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s ever tried to take their dog for a walk knows that it’s not always as simple as clipping on a leash and heading out the door. Some pups practically jump with excitement the moment they see their leash, while others turn the experience into a playful battle of wills. For one dog owner and her mischievous &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, Bear, that playful standoff has become a daily ritual, and a hilarious video of it has everyone online grinning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-captures-golden-retriever-s-daily-standoff-with-owner-and-leash"&gt;Video captures Golden Retriever’s ‘daily standoff’ with owner and leash&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bear has made quite an impression on Instagram after his owner posted a video showing their daily “standoff.” The clip begins with Bear’s mom approaching him slowly with a leash in her hand. Instead of greeting her with enthusiasm, Bear freezes in place and locks his eyes on her every move. It’s as if he’s assessing her strategy, preparing for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she inches closer, Bear’s tail begins to wag; first slowly and cautiously, then faster and faster, signaling his excitement and mischief brewing. Just as she gets within arm’s reach, Bear bolts right past her with comedic timing. His mom can’t help but laugh, calling the whole scene a familiar experience for “dog moms” everywhere. Her caption reads, “Dog moms will get it,” and judging by the flood of comments, she was absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One viewer noted, “Love how his tail gets faster as she gets closer lol.” Another said, “That is so golden behavior!” Someone else broke down the moment accurately: “The stare. Then the tail breaks form. Then you are done for.” One fan even turned the scene into a mock duel, writing, “You know when to draw your weapon when that tail starts wagging then you got the drop on ’em. Tail is a dead giveaway in a duel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Bear’s game is harmless fun, putting on a leash the right way is important for every dog’s safety. Experts recommend letting dogs sniff and get comfortable with the leash before clipping it on. Always ensure the collar or harness fits snugly but not too tight. As such, you should be able to slip two fingers between it and your dog’s neck. Moreover, rewarding your pup with treats or praise can help them associate the leash with something positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gerontologist Susie DiGiovanna, M.S. shares her “three A’s” of healthy aging: activate, adult and accept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying social, active and curious is key to longevity and joyful living, DiGiovanna emphasizes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acceptance of change and planning for the future brings peace, resilience and better quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For more than 22 years, Susie DiGiovanna, M.S., has worked in social services for a local municipality, helping older adults and their families navigate the many stages of aging. Through her time running programs, offering counseling and visiting seniors in their homes and at hospitals, she’s observed an abundance of examples of what it truly means to age well—and what can hold people back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I like to say that I have a front row seat to what healthy aging looks like and what unhealthy aging looks like,” the gerontologist tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. “It's been very, very educational for me personally and professionally, because I've gotten to know thousands and thousands of older adults through working at a very active senior center.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on those experiences, DiGiovanna distilled her philosophy into three simple but powerful principles: activating yourself, adulting and accepting new realities. She calls them the “three As of healthy aging,” and she explains how to prioritize these core elements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-activating-yourself"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Activating Yourself &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; DiGiovanna emphasizes that healthy adults are continually “activating” themselves through physical movement, connection and curiosity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You need to make it an actual concerted effort to be socializing, to be physically active, to be just really into what we now call ‘self-care,’ because those things don’t happen automatically or accidentally,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Her expert take is backed by science. According to a recent study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;, higher social engagement was linked with lower all-cause mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More social activity could mean joining a walking group, attending a fitness class at a senior center, hosting neighborhood potlucks or signing up for a book club. It could also be as simple as catching up with family and friends face-to-face on a more regular basis. These things build accountability, structure and joy, all factors that lead to a healthy lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A lot of older adults will say to me, ‘Well, I'm not a joiner, I've never been a joiner.’ That’s not a good thing,” DiGiovanna shares. “It is good to enjoy your own company, being alone sometimes, but I would say not being a ‘joiner' is going to work against you when you get older.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-adulting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Adulting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Okay, “adulting” feels pretty obvious, but it’s more than it seems. You may be guilty of not filling out and finalizing the necessary paperwork while in the midst of aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may be the hardest of the bunch, but it’s inevitable—and accepting and adjusting your routine to highlight your needs is a healthy way to welcome change.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered how a surface protein on brain cells, called Aplp1, can play a role in spreading material responsible for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease from cell to cell in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promisingly, an FDA-approved  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; drug that targets another protein – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte-activation_gene_3"&gt;Lag3&lt;/a&gt; – which interacts with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APLP1"&gt;Aplp1&lt;/a&gt; – was found to block this process in mice. This suggests a potential treatment for Parkinson's may already exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-49016-3"&gt;paper published last year&lt;/a&gt;, an international team of scientists detailed how the two proteins work together to help toxic clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein"&gt;alpha-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; protein get into brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-hints-at-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;Parkinson's Link to Gut Bacteria Hints at an Unexpected, Simple Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we know how Aplp1 and Lag3 interact, we have a new way of understanding how alpha-synuclein contributes to the disease progression of Parkinson's disease," neuroscientist Xiaobo Mao from Johns Hopkins University &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also suggest that targeting this interaction with drugs could significantly slow the progression of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/parkinson-disease"&gt;More than 8.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; globally have Parkinson's, the &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-disorders/parkinsons-disease-research/parkinsons-disease-challenges-progress-and-promise"&gt;second most common neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt; after  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is progressive and currently incurable, and it's usually only diagnosed when symptoms show. These include tremors, stiffness, balance issues, speech difficulties, disturbed sleep patterns, and mental health issues. In advanced stages, patients may eventually struggle to walk or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Parkinson's symptoms stem from the loss or dysfunction of dopamine-producing neurons in a brain region involved in fine motor control, called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;. This is thought to be caused by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body"&gt;Lewy bodies&lt;/a&gt; – abnormal clumps of protein, primarily made up of misfolded alpha-synuclein, that move from neuron to neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642.jpg" alt="A brown spot on blue and white cells" class="size-full wp-image-140247" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alpha-synuclein shown by positive staining (brown) in a Lewy body in the substantia nigra of a patient with Parkinson's disease.

That said, identifying whether this is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-confused-immune-system-could-be-behind-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;a cause of Parkinson's or a symptom&lt;/a&gt; is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah3374"&gt;Past studies&lt;/a&gt; on mice &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011196118"&gt;found Lag3 binds to alpha-synuclein proteins&lt;/a&gt; and spreads Parkinson's disease pathology in neurons. While deleting Lag3 significantly impedes this process, it does not completely prevent it, indicating another protein was also implicated in neurons taking in misfolded alpha-synuclein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work previously demonstrated that Lag3 wasn't the only cell surface protein that helped neurons absorb alpha-synuclein, so we turned to Aplp1 in our most recent experiments," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Valina Dawson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists conducted tests with genetically modified mice that were missing either Aplp1 or Lag3, or both. They found Aplp1 and Lag3 can each independently help brain cells absorb harmful alpha-synuclein, but together they significantly increase the uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_130187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-130187" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image.jpg" alt="A white neuron on black " class="size-full wp-image-130187" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-130187" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neuron expressing Aplp1 (in white), which allows brain cells to absorb proteins associated with Parkinson's disease. (Yasuyoshi Kimura)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice were missing both Aplp1 and Lag3, 90 percent less of the harmful alpha-synuclein entered healthy brain cells, meaning a greater amount of the harmful protein clumps was blocked with both proteins missing compared with a deletion of just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers gave normal mice the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab/relatlimab"&gt;nivolumab/relatlimab&lt;/a&gt;, a melanoma medication that contains a Lag3  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt;, and found that it also stopped Aplp1 and Lag3 from interacting, again almost completely blocking the formation of disease-causing alpha-synuclein clumps in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The anti-Lag3 antibody was successful in preventing further spread of alpha-synuclein seeds in the mouse models and exhibited better efficacy than Lag3-depletion because of Aplp1's close association with Lag3," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Ted Dawson, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to test the Lag3 antibody on mouse models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's – where &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202303775"&gt;research has pointed to Lag3&lt;/a&gt; as a target too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-49016-3"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hunters from around the world flock to Athens and neighboring counties every fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the industry and people who depend on it are facing new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/20/chronic-wasting-disease-spread-zombie-deer-global-us-aoe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Chronic wasting disease&lt;/a&gt; (CWD) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are killing wild deer in greater numbers in dozens of rural counties across the midwest that depend on the industry. The number of sick and dead deer reported by the public to Ohio’s department of natural resources grew&lt;a href="https://gis.ohiodnr.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=615d8f4f49f94e2aaff3c7fcd232fde7#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-1990be59c9c-layer-2%3A1047" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; from 2,093 in 2024 to 8,759 this year&lt;/a&gt;. That animals are being found dead in or near creeks and rivers may also present a health risk to communities dependent on local waterways for drinking and other uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CWD is spread from animal to animal through body fluids such as saliva, urine and blood. With drought becoming more prevalent in the region in recent years, larger numbers of deer find themselves gathering at fewer watering spots to drink, fueling the spread of the disease in the early fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the case of EHD, warmer spring and fall temperatures allow for the spread of its carrier, culicoides variipennis, a biting midge that is typically killed off by freezing temperatures. The midge is attracted to mud and water sources, where it lays its eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“While it’s been around for a long time, the frequency and intensity of EDH is increasing, and studies are showing that’s happening especially in the upper midwest,” says Sonja Christensen, associate professor at the department of fisheries and wildlife at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It comes and goes, which makes it a challenge to chase it down. We can’t predict it very well. We do know that in the upper midwest we are seeing more of these large-scale mortality events happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the Ohio department of natural resources, midwestern deer populations infected with EHD are likely to die within three days after the onset of symptoms. CWD, which has a multi-year incubation period, has been detected in cervid species, mostly in deer, in 36 US states and four Canadian provinces, having been first detected in the contiguous US in wild deer in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say that warmer temperatures fueled by human-caused climate change can contribute to conditions that favor both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This year, the conditions were just right. We had a really wet beginning of spring, a really dry summer. The numbers of those midge carriers were up, which is why we’re seeing such a big increase in deer with EHD,” says Lindsey Krusling of the Ohio division of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Ohio, baiting and feeding deer has been banned in disease control areas in the north-west part of the state. Hunters across the midwest are being advised to have venison tested for presence of the diseases and to not eat from animals that appear sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deer hunting nationally is worth around $23bn, with much of that, hunting advocates say, going back into the conservation of forests, woods and wilderness areas that otherwise could be logged for timber, farmed or exploited for mineral and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hunters spend thousands of dollars on trips that outfitters use on food, accommodation, property taxes and the year-round maintenance of deer habitats. Ohio’s deer hunting industry is worth about $1.9bn a year, and in neighboring Pennsylvania, where nearly half a million deer are harvested annually, it’s worth around $2bn. In Michigan&lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2025/09/chronic-wasting-disease-detected-in-genesee-county-deer-for-first-time.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;, where counties are recording first-time case&lt;/a&gt;s of CWD in wild deer as recently as last month, deer hunting contributes about $2.3bn to the state’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aside from fueling rural midwestern economies, hunting whitetail deer also plays an important role in reducing damage to agricultural crops and lowering road accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Neither CWD nor EHD are thought to be transmittable to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The threats and impacts of chronic wasting disease and [epizootic] hemorrhagic disease are very different,” says Kip Adams, chief conservation officer at the National Deer Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With hemorrhagic disease, climate has a big impact. It’s all the way up through the north-east; it’s all the way across the midwest, up into Canada. This disease is far more widespread today than it was 10, 20 or certainly 30 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, while coming across dozens of deer carcasses in the woods may come as a shock to some, observers such as Adams believe the broader population of whitetail deer is not currently at significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While EHD can devastate a local population within a short period of time, scientists say that, given good habitat conditions, they can recover within five years. Moreover, some animals that contract EHD have been known to develop an immunity to the disease that can be lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The threats to local economies is probably going to be very little. Nationally, of all the hunters that go into the field each fall, less than half shoot a single deer. Only about 20% shoot more than one deer,” says Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Overall, there are still plenty of deer; folks can still go hunting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, the challenges of managing the spread of these diseases are not inconsiderable. And funding to study and closely track them can be difficult to come by because they generally don’t directly affect domestic animals or people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Barkhurst, losing a fall season of hunting is about much more than the loss of income that goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“My buddies and I, we’ve been hunting for three generations; it’s fellowship and hanging out. And now, you don’t go,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They’re trying to find something else to keep the group together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxORVBydGljWHktRmU5dzV2X3ZKZkFEaXVyVWxJT1FYVEpEVEVPb0FSeDFUcjNzNXlLT05HRkJRTWRaNWh4WWd3dE9xeHowbVlsRGtWRnBGTU1MUU50V2FkMklOVS1tRUZmU19pWC1ENUFjcDRqcmRaTjRaWFhBcDJYRzVESQ</guid></item><item><title>视频：金毛猎犬不停地看着主人的煎饼，然后再做-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-golden-retrievers-t-stop-120000910.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s nothing quite as tragic as watching someone else eat pancakes — just ask the Leos, the two &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retrievers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retrievers&lt;/a&gt; who share a name. In a video posted by @twogoldenleos, these Denver-based pups face the ultimate test of patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the table sits a half-eaten pancake, and both Leos can’t take their eyes off it. You can almost see the thought bubble in their head: “Why is that pancake not for me?” Their mom’s caption says it best: “Has never had a pancake but also cannot comprehend why these wouldn’t be for him?” And truly, the confusion on the dogs’ face is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retrievers can’t wait to try a pancake and politely ask for some in this video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens with one of the Golden Retrievers standing across the table, laser-focused on that pancake. He lets out a tiny growl, then looks away dramatically, as if pretending not to care. When his mom laughs, he glances back at her like, “Oh, so this is funny to you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A few more soft growls follow before Leo covers his eyes with a paw. Almost as if the sight of the pancake and not getting to eat them is too much for his heart to bear. He truly is overcome by the injustice of it all. Just when you think he’s given up, Leo gives his mom the most unimpressed look imaginable and lets out a single bark, the canine version of “enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then he walks over to join his brother, also named Leo, who’s sitting beside their mom on the couch, staring at the plate with the same mix of longing and hope.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol is a common health concern in the United States, affecting nearly 10% of adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Elevated cholesterol levels are linked to a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, which are the leading causes of death worldwide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all cholesterol is the same. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (LDL), often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, can accumulate in the arteries, increasing cardiovascular risk. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;High-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (HDL), known as “good” cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the arteries, providing a protective effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition plays a major role in cholesterol balance. And research shows that there are specific nutrients that can support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893923/habits-to-break-to-lower-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; in several different ways. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What are these nutrients, and how can they reduce your cholesterol? Read on to learn more, plus dietitian-backed strategies to work more cholesterol-lowering nutrients into your day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-soluble-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Soluble Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soluble fiber is a powerful ally for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-lower-your-cholesterol-naturally-11769022" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally lowering cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. “For reducing [unfavorable] LDL cholesterol, soluble fiber is particularly important as it can bind to cholesterol in the intestine and help remove it from the body,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.alisonrd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alison Kaplanes, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It works by forming a gel in your digestive tract that traps cholesterol building-blocks called bile acids. “Bile is essential for the digestion and absorption of fats, so the body needs to replace it,” explains &lt;a href="http://ashleyreaver.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashley Reaver, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “It does this by utilizing our cholesterol stores and, thus, lowering our cholesterol levels.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, few of us &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume enough fiber&lt;/a&gt;, including soluble fiber. While a good overall fiber goal is 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, you’ll need 10 to 25 grams of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber for optimal cholesterol-lowering&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Everyday foods like beans, lentils, chickpeas, apples, pears, citrus fruits and bananas are all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15696/is-fiber-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good sources of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;. However, two especially powerful sources are oats and barley. These are rich in beta-glucan, a unique type of soluble fiber with a long, proven cholesterol-lowering track record.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you don’t eat many foods rich in soluble fiber, you can also get it from psyllium husk, often found in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-fiber-supplements-8420645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplements&lt;/a&gt; or added to cereals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-unsaturated-fats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Unsaturated Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; that our bodies need for survival. But the type of fat you eat is important, especially for heart health. “Choose heart-healthy fats instead of animal or dairy fats, which are primarily saturated fat,” Kaplanes advises&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What are those heart-healthy fats, you ask? “The majority of fats should come from unsaturated fats,” says Reaver. There are two main families of unsaturated fats: monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. According to the American Heart Association, both of these fats may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; when used in place of saturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can get monounsaturated fats from avocados, peanut butter, olives, nuts, seeds and olive and canola oils. Polyunsaturated fats are also found in canola oil, as well as soybean oil, tofu, nuts, seeds and fatty fish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-omega-3-fats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Omega-3 Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3s are unique polyunsaturated fats that are best known for lowering triglycerides (fats in the blood that can also raise heart disease risk). Omega-3s may also help improve overall cholesterol balance by lowering total cholesterol and increasing favorable HDL cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, they have been shown to raise LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may not be a problem for everyone. But if you have high LDL and are considering an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 supplement&lt;/a&gt;, speak with your health care provider first. They may recommend combining an omega-3 supplement with cholesterol-lowering medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While supplements are an easy way to get omega-3s, they’re not the only way. “Eat fish twice a week, especially the SMASH fish with more heart-healthy omega 3s: salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring,” says Kaplanes. These fish are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in EPA and DHA&lt;/a&gt;, two types of long-chain omega-3s that have been studied most for heart protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-plant-sterols"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Plant Sterols &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant sterols, sometimes called phytosterols, are natural compounds found in small amounts in many plant foods. “Plant sterols have a similar chemical structure to the cholesterol from animals and can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb cholesterol from foods,” says Reaver. The result? Less LDL cholesterol makes it into your bloodstream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As helpful as plant sterols are, they only occur naturally in small amounts in a tiny handful of foods, such as corn, canola and soybean oils.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The most reliable way to get them in meaningful amounts is from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-consider-for-high-cholesterol-11784458" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant sterol-fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as fortified spreads, yogurts and milks. Or, talk to your health care provider about a supplement. Research has found that plant sterol supplements can increase beneficial HDL while simultaneously &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290873/how-to-lower-triglycerides-ldl-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lowering total and LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. They may also lower Apo-B, a troublesome protein in the blood that can significantly increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. The good news is, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-11794255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire eating plan. In fact, lower cholesterol often comes down to making a few smart swaps and adding more of the right foods and nutrients. For instance, research has found that soluble fiber, unsaturated fats, omega-3 fats and plant sterols can all help lower cholesterol. While each of these is a win for heart health on its own, they all work in slightly different ways. So, consider adding a few of them to your rotation. Together, they can create a strong &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foundation for heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

Over dinner the night before, he told his mom, Jessica, he wanted to be on the water by 7am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica and JB were unusually close. When her work brought her to Austin, she stayed in his spare room; when the pandemic hit, she moved in for good. Despite a full life – a girlfriend, a job, a side hustle running an online thrift store – he welcomed her. They planted vegetables, packed meals for homeless people, watched true crime, even shared their phone locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That morning, Jessica woke up eager to text him the same silly joke she always sent on his fishing trips: a screenshot of his coordinates – a dot in the water – captioned: “YOU’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But JB’s phone did not show up on the map. It was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica started calling his friends, all of whom had lost track of him the previous night. Then she received a message on Instagram: “URGENT,” it said, next to a phone number. “Call now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB had overdosed on fentanyl and had been found unresponsive in a friend’s apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one knew how long he had been without sufficient oxygen. He was transported to an Austin-area hospital, where the damage became clear: JB had sustained a brain injury and severe damage to his liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By the standard measures of America’s opioid crisis, JB was one of the lucky ones. He did not get added to the nation’s tally of overdose opioids deaths – an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;55,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, and more than 1m over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But having survived, the 30-year-old now lives with life-changing injuries. Five years on, JB cannot walk or talk.

During the day, she works remotely as a social media manager and does her best to keep him engaged and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB’s story highlights a cruel irony: while overdose deaths &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have declined&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to the life-saving drug naloxone (better known by the brand name Narcan), more people are surviving with serious, sometimes devastating complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the epidemic within the epidemic – one we rarely count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I knew JB’s story was not unique: my family had lived through something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My cousin’s only son, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447110/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mason Bogert&lt;/a&gt;, overdosed on synthetic opioids and benzodiazepines when he was 18.

His tech skills became an accomplice to addiction: he bought the drugs that almost killed him on the dark web because they could evade detection in urine tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His parents found him without a pulse Mother’s Day morning, 2016. He lived the next five years in need of constant care, shuffling between ICUs, rehabilitation hospitals, and nursing homes across New England. The overdose left him blind and immobilized by spasticity, or very stiff muscles, a condition common with severe brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But, over time, Mason became increasingly aware. He began to communicate by spelling – opening his mouth to signal the correct letter – a method that allowed greater self-expression, and revealed he understood his circumstances and that he was deeply sad and frustrated by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four years into his ordeal, we gathered to celebrate the fact that the earnings from his app had just broken the million-dollar mark – symbolic of a promising, even brilliant young life cut short. He died from pneumonia a few months later, two days after his 23rd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one knows how many people survive opioid overdoses.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10958315/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;best estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that for every fatal overdose, there are 15 non-fatal ones – which puts their number at well over 1m annually in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-2jn2c1"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Surviving an overdose can leave families fighting a different kind of crisis – one measured not in deaths, but in years of care&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, shared with me her “conservative” but staggering estimate that half a million Americans each year risk brain damage from opioid-induced hypoxia, which is when the body is not receiving an adequate amount of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What effect these events have on people’s health, and how many are truly affected are burning questions. Volkow believes most injuries manifest in quiet but life-altering ways such as memory loss or diminished executive function. They can affect one’s ability to hold down a job, or fully participate in addiction recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Severe cases can drain patients of their life potential, according to Dr Jennifer Stevens, the director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Young people in particular can become “incredibly financially toxic to themselves and their loved ones” when they are not able to work or require long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, surviving an overdose can leave families fighting a different kind of crisis – one measured not in deaths, but in years of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An overdose occurs when opioids overwhelm receptors in the brain, leading to slower breathing and respiratory depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts believe brain injuries can occur after four or five minutes of inadequate respiration. The longer the brain and body go without sufficient oxygen, the worse injuries are likely to be – but outcomes remain a bit of a black box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec313148-8a53-46da-bf64-654523ab030a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Nurse Kenneth Emakpose, brushes JB’s teeth during his morning hygiene routine. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few years ago, Ashley Six-Workman, a nurse with West Virginia University’s Rockefeller &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neuroscience" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; Institute, found a woman who had overdosed and been down for at least a few minutes in a parking lot. She did not have Narcan, so when she began doing CPR and waiting for emergency medical services, she feared the worst: she thought she was going to have an anoxic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When the woman walked out of the hospital three days later, Six-Workman was both relieved and intrigued. “Clinically, in my head, it didn’t make sense,” she told me. “She should have some sort of impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data from a &lt;a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201701-022OC" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare study&lt;/a&gt; of overdose-related ICU admissions from 162 hospitals between 2009 and 2015 offers a sense of scale of the most extreme cases: of the 21,705 patients who required critical care, 8% suffered a catastrophic anoxic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But this data predates the opioid epidemic’s “third wave”, when fentanyl drove overdoses to unprecedented levels – so today’s numbers are almost certainly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because fentanyl crosses the blood-brain barrier so easily, it can trigger an overdose within minutes, leading to respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. “You have a faster onset and a narrower window to intervene,” said Erin Winstanley, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, naloxone has saved millions of lives: pharmacies sold 12.9m doses between October 2002 and September 2023. Yet each revived overdose also means another survivor left at risk of lasting complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also increasingly common for people to live through not just one, but multiple overdoses. Jon Zibbell, an epidemiologist who studies adverse health outcomes among people who inject and smoke street drugs, became concerned about the phenomenon as he witnessed people repeatedly overdosing on fentanyl and being revived by Narcan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a4447b38-4bd7-4cd7-97ed-f5bd1337a25d" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--immersive element-immersive dcr-imskkt"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tdqfl9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jessica wheels her son to attend a medical appointment at the Texas Institute of Rehabilitation and Recovery, better known as TIRR-Memorial Hermann, one of the US’s premier brain rehabilitation centers.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That survival is, on its face, a triumph of advocacy and harm-reduction policy. But Zibbell now worries about the cumulative toll. People he knew often felt “off-kilter” after a single overdose; what happens after a series of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hypothesizes that the repeated injuries may be somewhat analogous to what happens with a cluster of mini-strokes – or to football players who, after multiple minor concussions, develop chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a devastating neurodegenerative disease. But it is going unnoticed, he adds, because non-fatal overdoses are perceived as harmless, and because their effects are often not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his co-authors flagged the issue in a &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/non-fatal-opioid-overdose-associated-health-outcomes-final-summary-report-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;federal report&lt;/a&gt; on the health consequences of non-fatal overdoses back in 2019. “I believe it’s a silent epidemic of many non-fatal overdoses,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early research supports this theory, and suggests repeated non-fatal overdoses may lead to Alzheimer’s-like brain pathologies. Postmortem studies show elevated tau levels, the protein found at high levels in Alzheimer’s and CTE patients, while imaging of survivors reveals reduced hippocampal volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The problem has only grown more urgent as the drug supply has become increasingly toxic and unpredictable, said Zibbell. Today, Americans are not exposed to fentanyl alone, but instead are consuming a cocktail of lesser-known synthetic substances, and these contaminants can limit the effectiveness of Narcan and prolong downtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Recent CDC data appears to reflect his concern: between 2021 and 2023, ER visits for opioid overdoses &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/data-research/facts-stats/dose-dashboard-nonfatal-discharge-data.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, but related hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/data-research/facts-stats/dose-dashboard-nonfatal-discharge-data.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt; – suggesting patients now arrive in more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Zibbell, it marks a new phase in the opioid crisis: one that may be less likely to kill, but more likely to harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost from the moment Jessica arrived at the hospital after JB’s overdose, she sensed she and his medical team were on opposing sides. She was waiting for JB to wake up, she said, while they were waiting for JB to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica remembers doctors aggressively urging them to withdraw life support on the second day of his hospitalization. “We were being literally harassed for his organs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="de173704-07f6-42d8-be82-25657f4022a5" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr Cindy Ivanhoe, a professor of physical medicine at UTHealth Houston and director of the spasticity program and associated syndromes of movement at TIRR-Memorial Hermann, consults with Jessica Jarrett and her son, JB.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Compared to traumatic brain injuries, anoxic and hypoxic injuries caused by oxygen deficiency are barely studied, in part because outcomes have generally been considered very poor. (One neurologist, who wants to remain anonymous, told me that when his friend’s heart attack resulted in such an injury, his first impulse was “to put a pillow over his head”; that friend has fully recovered and remains alive decades later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When JB first opened his eyes five days in, the neurologist refused to watch Jessica’s video proof of it; it would not change his recommendation, he told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB then moved to a long-term acute care facility that specialized in neuro-rehabilitation. It should have been an ideal place for him, but he languished there, heavily medicated and unable to actively “participate” – as required by insurance companies – in therapy. As a result, staff withheld those activities, including the stretching of limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four months after his overdose, JB still had not been out of a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At one point, he dislocated his hip, an excruciating injury that went unnoticed until Jessica pinpointed its source through the rudimentary communication system she had worked out: he would stick out his tongue to signal “yes”, which he did when she pointed to his hip.

He smiled and reacted, gave thumbs ups, and even started to work on communicating with a laser-pointing headband and a letter board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When he was discharged, his injuries were still profound, but each small sign of recovery validated Jessica: JB had already proven the doctors who predicted a permanent vegetative state wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A half-dozen families I interviewed described the same experience: once hospitalized with overdose-related brain injuries, their loved ones were treated as lost causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many felt judged harshly by medical staff for the role drugs played in the injuries, or for the decisions they made around their care. And a number shared the belief that young anoxic brain injury patients, often overdose survivors, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/organ-transplants-donors-alive.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prematurely targeted&lt;/a&gt; for organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5a03741a-4d7f-4ca1-b9c7-63c37e07dff8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jessica tucks JB into bed for the night. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Put simply, trust is low, strained further by the complexity of these cases and the uncertainty among providers about how to treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The families I spoke with often trusted the collective wisdom and lived experience of other caregivers online more than doctors, who see these cases rarely and usually not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Cindy Ivanhoe, a brain injury specialist at TIRR who treats JB, does not blame them. “It’s a very hard system to navigate,” she said. “It’s very hard to advocate.” She also sometimes wonders how much of her patients’ complications stem from the side effects of medications or medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experience can be isolating, too. Several parents told me they were shunned from support groups for families of opioid victims since their loved ones were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1f663d89-1de7-458f-8c60-f231ec948ec7" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--immersive element-immersive dcr-imskkt"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tdqfl9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;JB sleeps under a starry sky nightlight in his bedroom.

He had overdosed on what the doctors called a “scrambler” – a cocktail of benzodiazepines, opiates and cocaine – and been found by paramedics after an unknown period of time. Harman, then 24, was not breathing on his own, and an EEG showed little brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A restless, thrill-seeking kid who gravitated towards risky sports, Kyle had been battling addiction for years before the overdose that nearly killed him in 2016. He had begun experimenting with drugs in high school, and the following years had been a blur of stress and rock-bottom moments for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kyle estimates he overdosed 16 to 18 times, including once when his grandmother had to break the door down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bc6e30a7-9cd2-4055-8707-afc6a6df33e5" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle Harman rides a tricycle around town, including in the neighborhood of his mom and stepdad, Lauren and Matt McGinnis, in Salisbury, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the hospital, doctors did not expect Kyle to advance beyond a vegetative state. One offered frank advice: “Consider quality of life over quantity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kyle’s parents decided to wait, and in the following days they glimpsed flickers of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The neurologist cautioned Kyle’s path would not be linear as his body detoxed, neuro-stormed, and battled multiple related complications including kidney failure, pneumonia and withdrawal. And it was true: some days, his mother, Lauren, could see signs of her son. One day, he surprised them by suddenly mouthing the words of a favorite Bob Marley song playing in the background; on others, he would stare blankly into space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total, he spent 17 days in the ICU, the first seven in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts are &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.26619" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rethinking&lt;/a&gt; the conventional wisdom that patients who experience an anoxic event have little chance of recovery. The highly visible case of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest on the field in 2023, is one example, but broader statistics suggest better outcomes are possible, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11056133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;particularly for&lt;/a&gt; overdose survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Younger, healthier patients tend to do better, as do those who receive CPR quickly, and those who start rehabilitation soon after their injuries – but what sort of recovery a patient will make generally remains a mystery. (A common saying in the community is: if you’ve seen one brain injury, you’ve seen one brain injury.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="258ee976-8edc-4bdf-8162-200c1048929c" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle and his stepdad, Matt McGinnis, at home in Salisbury, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kyle spent the next six months passing through various care centers, relearning basic skills: swallowing, then eating and drinking, whispering and speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His recovery accelerated at Bryn Mawr rehabilitation hospital, a dedicated brain injury rehabilitation center near Philadelphia. Soon, he even developed a reputation for defying facility rules. He so disliked the food that he repeatedly used gift cards and Uber Eats to order in Philly cheesesteaks for himself and select staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By the time he was finally discharged, a couple of nursing home stays later, he was using a walker. Six months had passed since his overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Does the fact that Kyle began rehabilitation on day three, whereas JB started on month five, explain their diverging trajectories? That is impossible to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some patients get better, some patients get worse,” said Ivanhoe, the brain specialist who treats JB. “We are not great at predicting who’s going to do what, and so I would just not like to take those opportunities away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/1582f3b835dc8ff5ede78b5b49085f03738b8edf/0_0_5119_7674/5119.jpg&amp;amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/1582f3b835dc8ff5ede78b5b49085f03738b8edf/0_0_5119_7674/5119.jpg&amp;amp;label_before=&amp;amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/f5855acc633a7a78f16350caa80d2f3a312dab4e/0_0_5464_7895/5464.jpg&amp;amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/f5855acc633a7a78f16350caa80d2f3a312dab4e/0_0_5464_7895/5464.jpg&amp;amp;label_after=&amp;amp;analytics_label=opioid-1&amp;amp;type=duo&amp;amp;","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"A childhood picture of a dad and his son fishing;

Doctors had hoped that switching to a J-tube, which bypasses the stomach, would ease his reflux. Instead, it brought more serious problems: repeated aspiration pneumonia, another trip to the ER and now, the decision to return to his original G-tube, which required surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica’s warmth filled the house. Amid boxes of medical supplies, a foil “happy birthday” banner hung above the mantle, next to a “PRAY4JB” license plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="116efd9e-af07-48fe-989c-a10f442794b0" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle chats at Kellyn’s Kafe with his mom, stepdad, and the cafe’s owner, Andrew Hannah.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica spoke to JB normally, and as we chatted in their living room, she got up every so often to adjust JB’s position, stretch his muscles and suction his throat. He expressed discomfort, but she could not figure out the source. (Later that afternoon, an occupational therapist stopped by. Using the movement of his shoulder to communicate with him – internal and external rotation for “yes” and “no” – she determined he was cold.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a hard life,” Jessica acknowledged in one of our conversations. “Would JB &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live like this? I hold a lot of guilt around that. I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, she sees their lives as far richer than the picture doctors initially presented to her. She is relentlessly positive and certain his recovery has more chapters to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the months since my visit, there has been evidence of that: JB’s health has stabilized, and he has begun to communicate more easily again by turning his head, and blinking and closing his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of effort, JB got approved for Medicaid in April, which means for the first time in four years, he now receives professional nursing support 24 hours a week. Jessica is hopeful JB will also start working with a speech therapist and that emerging technologies will help him communicate more fully soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At 34, Kyle lives with his mom and stepdad, Lauren and Matt McGinnis, in Salisbury, Maryland. On a quiet February afternoon, their tidy living room bore a framed sign: “It’s so good to be home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Little physical evidence of Kyle’s ordeal remains today, other than the scar left behind by his tracheostomy tube and the cane he uses to support his uneven gait. The residual cognitive and behavioral impact of his brain injury are harder to parse. Aside from his lost overdose memories, Kyle believes he is back to his old self: “My brain was injured, that has no bearing on me now,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His parents seemed accustomed to this disagreement, which they navigated gently in my presence. “I love you to death, buddy,” Matt prefaced before pointing to changes they have observed, such as Kyle’s trouble focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They reminded him of a conversation with his neurologist several years ago. Pointing to a cluster of dark spots on a scan of Kyle’s brain, she had compared it to a 70-year-old’s. Those damaged areas would not heal, but to give his brain the best shot at forming new pathways, she told him, he needed to embrace a life of routine and order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For a time, Kyle followed through. He enrolled in the local community college, working toward an associate’s degree in counseling. He made the dean’s list, and even drafted a business plan for a rehab center he wanted to name after his dad, who had died of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just before finishing the program, he quit, thinking it was a waste to spend money just to get a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He tried jobs at call centers, which he did not care for, and in 2023, became certified as a life insurance broker, though he is not working as one as he sees a driver’s license as necessary for the job. (His was revoked a few years ago when Kyle was stopped for driving under the influence, an incident Kyle blames on his friend who refused to let him stay on his couch after a couple beers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I visited, Kyle was spending his days in his bedroom trading crypto and aggressively pursuing the reinstatement of his driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His actions may be hard to understand, but they reflect common struggles for brain injury patients, who can experience lower self-awareness and heightened impulsivity and risk-taking. Traumatic brain injury is linked to substance abuse – it is both a risk factor and can make addiction harder to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kyle’s biggest setback came in 2018 when, two years into his remarkable recovery, he overdosed on fentanyl again. In an account his parents find dubious, he insists he found a bag of cocaine in the front yard and could not resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whatever the case, his stepfather and paramedics used four doses of Narcan to revive him. After a week in the hospital, his family and their pastor – a recovering addict himself – staged an intervention and sent Kyle to Hazelden Betty Ford, the addiction rehabilitation clinic in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2c302ac-132c-4588-9dd9-601ae624986e" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle tries to walk a couple miles every day on the treadmill in his family’s basement.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It did not go well – “I wasn’t having it,” Kyle told me. After a couple weeks, the center released him to a homeless shelter in Minneapolis. Kyle spent the next five months there, attending addiction counseling during the day and sleeping in the shelter at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After leaving in spring 2019, he stayed sober. His parents marvel both at the humane design of the city’s shelter system and at Kyle’s ability to thrive in it. “He did it on his own, with a brain injury and a cane,” Matt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I visited earlier this year, Kyle insisted he would never touch drugs again. “My life is shit,” he told me – not as a complaint, but as a reason not to make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not an easy path, though: as this story was going to press, Kyle was preparing to go to Florida for mental health counseling and a change of environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hopes he will also get physical rehabilitation there. He is determined to walk completely unassisted one day and wants to move into his own place, get his driver’s license back, and sell life insurance or work in finance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Not that he plans to forget his past. When he gets questions about his cane, he gives it to them straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A tiny chip implanted into the eyes of people suffering vision loss from irreversible age-related macular degeneration has restored central sight in a dazzling first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called the PRIMA system, tested across 17 European hospitals, and it restored central vision in 26 of 32 patients who used it for 12 months – many of whom could even read again. The result, developed by a large international team of doctors and scientists over many years, represents a massive breakthrough in treatments for vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the first time that any attempt at vision restoration has achieved such results in a large number of patients," &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/news/retinal-implant-restores-central-vision-patients-age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;says ophthamologist José-Alain Sahel&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, co-senior author on a paper describing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More than 80 percent of the patients were able to read letters and words, and some of them are reading pages in a book. This is really something we couldn't have dreamt of when we started on this journey, together with Daniel Palanker, 15 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2023.29.5-a.s2"&gt;Geographic vision loss&lt;/a&gt; from age-related macular degeneration is a progressive and irreversible condition that affects millions of people around the world. The macula, which is responsible for high-resolution central vision, resides within the retina at the back of the eye. As this part of the retina trophies, patches of blindness develop in a person's central vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy retina, photoreceptor cells convert light into electrical signals that are processed in the inner retina and sent to the brain. For people with geographic atrophy, these photoreceptor cells die off, which means that part of the eye is not receiving light signals, creating a blind spot in the center of their vision, while peripheral vision is less affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMcp2102061"&gt;not everyone&lt;/a&gt; with age-related macular degeneration will experience geographic atrophy, for the millions that do, it can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIMA, the brainchild of ophthalmologist Daniel Palanker of Stanford University, co-senior author of the research paper led by ophthalmologist Frank Holz of the University of Bonn in Germany, could be poised to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system consists of two parts. The implant is a tiny wireless silicon sensor, just two by two millimeters in area and less than the width of a hair in thickness, and containing 378 photovoltaic pixels. It's slipped in behind the retina where the cellular atrophy is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178326" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-178326" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation-600x411.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178326" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The eye of a patient before and after implantation of the photovoltaic array. (Holz et al, &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part of PRIMA is a pair of glasses connected to a pocket processor. The glasses capture images and convert them into near-infrared light near the 880-nanometer wavelength before sending them to the implant. The wavelength is important: near-infrared light is &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/"&gt;invisible to the human eye&lt;/a&gt;, so it will not be perceived by the healthy retinal photoreceptors or interfere with the patient's remaining peripheral vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant, in turn, converts the infrared signals into electrical signals and sends them to the brain to be perceived, similar to how the natural eye converts and transmits data. And because the implant is powered by light, it doesn't need an external power source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extensive clinical testing and a small, five-participant  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178320" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers were ready for the next step. They recruited 38 patients in 17 hospitals across five European countries to test the system for 12 months; six of those patients were unavailable for follow-up at the end of the trial period, so the results are based on the remaining 32 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean age of the patients was 79, and all were experiencing vision loss from geographic atrophy. Their vision was tested before undergoing the trial, and again at several points during the trial. Initially, the patients had to spend several months learning how to use PRIMA, including the functions of the system, such as zooming in on text, and interpreting the electrical patterns as visual shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients – 26, or 81 percent – experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision, with some patients even reaching vision close to 20/420, the resolution limit of the PRIMA system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178327" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178327" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-178327" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178327" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Simulations of a macular degeneration patient's vision before (left) and after (right) implantation of the PRIMA system.

I was nervous, excited, all those things. There was no pain during the operation, but you're still aware of what's happening. It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It's not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that 19 of the participants experienced adverse effects, all of which are known complications of eye surgery, and most of which were resolved quickly. Crucially, peripheral vision remained unaffected in all patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, PRIMA only works in black-and-white. The researchers are working to develop a grayscale version and to increase the resolution of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Number one on the patients' wish list is reading, but number two, very close behind, is face recognition. And face recognition requires grayscale," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/10/eye-prosthesis.html"&gt;Palanker says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first version of the chip, and resolution is relatively low. The next generation of the chip, with smaller pixels, will have better resolution and be paired with sleeker-looking glasses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

ingredients and additives typical to UPFs, such as emulsifiers may also play a role.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers followed 33,654 middle-age participants who completed an online dietary questionnaire and blood tests around eight years before having a brain scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.1" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/10/10/health_newsletter.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Additive-laden foods such as crisps and sweets have been vilified for decades over their supposed risks, with dozens of studies linking them to type 2 diabetes and other diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The questionnaire involved a 24-hour dietary recall consisting of over 200 food items in which participants had to indicate how many portions of each food item they had consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then estimated energy consumption for each item, excluding any participants who reported consuming extreme amounts of calories—defined as anything less than 500 kcal and more than 5000 kcal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, the recommended daily calorie intake is around 2,500 kcal for men and 2,000 kcal for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants consumed around 2,608 kcal a day—just over 46 per cent of which came from ultra processed foods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods were then split into four categories using the NOVA system: unprocessed or minimally processed, processed ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that higher ultraprocessed food consumption was associated with brain changes in areas involved in hunger and reward circuits, suggesting that ultraprocessed foods exert effects on the brain beyond just contributing to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hypothalamus—responsible for regulating hunger among other things—eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with lower mean diffusivity, indicating increased cell density and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This inflammation can disrupt how the brain regulates hunger, satiety and reward—all of which are central to food addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the brain's regulation of hunger is impaired, and its reward circuits are overstimulated, people may crave more of these foods despite being full, and lose control over how much they eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that damage to this brain circuit, involved in food liking and cravings, 'may favour maladaptive eating, like more ultra processed foods, and metabolic disease, further perpetuating a vicious cycle.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In brain regions involved in rewards and motivation, however—like the nucleus accumbens and pallidum—eating more ultraprocessed foods was associated with signs of reduced cell density and increased water content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, these changes could reflect early signs of cognitive decline, brain shrinkage and cell loss—which could weaken self-control around food and reinforce compulsive eating habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'Eating ultraprocessed foods increases several nutrient and metabolic markers of disease and is associated with structural brain changes in areas that regulate eating behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings provide insight into how ultraprocessed foods consumption may perpetuate itself while contributing to adverse health effects.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14690703/handful-day-risk-cancer-heart-attack-study-ultra-processed-food.html"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;earlier this year found that consuming just an extra 100g of UPFs each day—roughly two packets of crisps—raised the risk of life-threatening heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers assessed 41 studies spanning North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania involving 8,286,940 adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found each additional 100g per day of UPF consumption was associated with a 5.9 per cent increased risk of cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Asia 2025 conference in Singapore, also showed adults had a 14.5 per cent higher risk of high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella term UPFs is used to cover anything edible made with colourings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready-meals, ice cream and tomato ketchup are some of the best-loved examples of products that fall under the umbrella UPF term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK is the worst in Europe for eating UPFs, which make up an estimated 57 per cent of the national diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:52:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNM3d1VDJILWtCWHdhSW9CMnhCNzBSRWdnbHpIQnJnd1ZZU3lqWjhWQS16MW5mNzltSXhPWF8wWkJWZ3ppSFBiUnZQdVpBQ3Q5SUd3cXU4dTM5R2t1eHFybUpMdEZyeUJ4Q0RqWlFUdTdVSU5BTmVndVlRaldHSW91d0dlTS0xMWJTNlYxczdYQmZfUjUta05sNXlRT2d3SThOWjFF</guid></item><item><title>这种健康综合症影响几乎所有美国人。那你为什么没听说过呢？ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-health-syndrome-affects-nearly-all-americans-so-why-havent-you-heard-of-it-2000674346</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chances are, you’re probably in the dark about a health problem that affects nearly every adult in America. A new survey shows that almost 90% of Americans have never heard of the recently defined syndrome known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic, or CKM, syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll conducted the online survey in August on behalf of the American Heart Association. Based on responses from more than 4,000 people, the survey found that only 12% were previously aware of CKM syndrome. The findings suggest that few people are on the lookout for this condition, despite the vast majority of Americans having some form of it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We want people to know that it’s really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time,” said Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association’s chief medical officer for prevention, in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Interconnected organs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AHA &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X23000282"&gt;coined&lt;/a&gt; the term “CKM syndrome” in October 2023. The label is meant to reflect the reality that our kidneys and heart depend heavily on each other, and that both in turn are heavily affected by our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It broadly combines four other conditions and their associated risk factors: heart disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, all of which can be connected to the others. Someone living with obesity, for instance, is more likely to develop the other three conditions. CKM is further broken down into four stages, depending on the level of risk factors or related diseases a person has. Someone with stage 1 CKM, for example, has no apparent symptoms but does have excess body fat, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Past research has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818457"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that about 90% of Americans meet the criteria for CKM syndrome, with about 50% in stage 2. Many people also have risk factors that can make them vulnerable to all of the diseases under the umbrella of CKM, such as hypertension, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;In the dark, but willing to learn more&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to most not knowing about CKM, 68% of respondents in the survey wrongly believed that it’s best to take care of these conditions separately or weren’t sure about how to manage them. About 42% also incorrectly believed that a healthy heart couldn’t be affected by other organs or weren’t sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way,” Sanchez said. “These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the bright side, though most Americans might be unaware about the existence of CKM, plenty in the AHA survey were curious once they were told about it. Over two-thirds felt it was important to learn more about the syndrome or their overall CKM health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AHA has just launched a public health campaign on CKM, which includes a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome"&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbHwmhWthzM"&gt;short YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;. Early next year, the organization will also release the first formal guidelines on the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

I walk every day and belong to an exercise group that I attend twice a week. I'm writing because during a routine dental cleaning, my dentist noticed a spot on the left side of my tongue that turned out to be squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I've never smoked, and I drink less than one alcoholic drink per month. I've had my surgery, and my PET scan was negative for the cancer spreading into my lymph nodes. So, I was fortunate to catch it fairly early. My message to your readers is to please get your routine teeth cleanings; it just might save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Anon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Anon.:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a message worth publishing. I congratulate you on your apparent cure and appreciate your writing. My own dentist is diligent about doing a careful mouth exam for cancer every visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The traditional risk factors for squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the head and neck have been smoking and tobacco use, including chewing tobacco. However, human papilloma virus (HPV) has recently emerged as a major risk factor for SCC. The treatment is the same for HPV-related SCC as it is for non-HPV-related SCC, but the prognosis is better if the cancer is associated with HPV, which the pathologist normally tests for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Since the HPV vaccine is effective at reducing the risk of head and neck cancer, it is critical that we continue to vaccinate our children. HPV isn't just a sexually transmitted infection; it's a preventable cause of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Can having a bunion cause a different problem on the same leg? I saw an orthopedist about a bunion eight to nine years ago and was told it could be fixed, but since the bunion doesn't hurt, he recommend waiting until it does hurt. It mostly doesn't bother me; I've never worn the type of shoes like high heels that make it worse.But in the past year, I've developed arthritis on the inside part of my knee on the same leg. Rehab exercises and "arthritis strength" acetaminophen mostly keep the pain under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I'm wondering whether having a bunion can cause the knee to develop arthritis, perhaps affecting the way I walk and stressing the knee? Should I consider having the bunion fixed in order to prevent further damage to my knee? I'm a female, age 67, and I'm reluctant to have the bunion corrected as I understand it's a very painful procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— B.J.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear B.J.S.:&lt;/strong&gt; A bunion is an acquired malformation of the large toe at the metatarsophalyngeal joint, so the joint sticks out toward the outside of the foot while the toe points toward the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;You are right that problems in one joint (like your big toe) can affect another (like your knee or hip). When you are in pain, the body learns to walk in such a way as to minimize pain, but this abnormal gait can put stress on other joints. I often see people who don't notice the pain in the original location as their body is so adept at changing pressures to avoid the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the other hand, one of many underlying conditions that can lead to a bunion deformity is arthritis. It is possible that you were destined to develop knee arthritis, and the bunion had nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I've had many patients who have been treated for bunion deformities, but not all people need surgery. Conservative management including shoes with a wide-toe box, orthotics, and pain management are adequate for many. The success rate and tolerability of surgery has significantly improved, so many more of my patients are satisfied with their results than patients from 30 years ago. But I still don't recommend rushing into a procedure.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:01:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxQWjBiVjUwNWpSVmdMTzh0MWZBaXA2ZzNpQ3Q2ZHNNVjJhVzdaRTBJSzdTbmo4VW5uaWdiNmd5bW5pOERtME5WaFZ4Q1B1ODFDTWMzTGU5Z0p5Q0tvRWFMYjNPd080Z3pfTTZQck5YbE5xcUtJd01hNTZ3dzhJMTFBTEc1UFFrR1RBb3FOWHdJUWZsMTlwR3FPRl9sTmlxa1drX3V1SVJWZ1lVNnkzaWhPWF9mR0FGQVo4VVJCYVczX18yU09qMHUzZGZCb1JCZ2hCcDBPWG1QQTk</guid></item><item><title>犹他州和亚利桑那州报告的麻疹病例超过100例-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/well/more-than-100-cases-of-measles-reported-in-utah-and-arizona.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:01:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTXhzaV9pc05jZ2VhOHZSWWljemZlTHNRTl9rRnFyYTZMZEVnbEZKU2F5Q21FY0JISjN2WWo1YlNVZ01BdTlpOGhmUkp6Z0hUdGg5SWtjSE5JbFd4TkxneTUxZV94eHNGbDNJY0FNUkZpeENpYWFmSGhoVkx4WFl4WWpqcWlIZlRuSmNKaENpR1l3UmN2SWl3YjZBbWhFYnlIREZMSGo1dw</guid></item><item><title>“感冒喂食，发烧挨饿”这句格言有什么道理吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/well/eat/feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever-truth.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOMTdGLUtiMGtwMnNQeDh2NVB0dVh1MFl0eGFIN2o0eU9tWmdWdkE0U2RlSkFVNnhPdDRXM0NEdXZLbFJvZlp4QlA0cXJMSENqWGVIZWU5dE5ORVVzdjg1T1NQcEJXa29IdE4tc1pzcHpURXpyZENCblJBNzhpQUpnbEEtUzJ0T1Fw</guid></item><item><title>“心力衰竭比你想象的更常见” ：心脏病专家揭示体征和症状以及早发现-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-failure-is-more-common-than-you-think-cardiologist-reveals-signs-and-symptoms-to-detect-early-and-prevention-tips/articleshow/124716931.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure is a serious medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide, yet many remain unaware of how common it is or how critical early detection can be. It occurs when the heart cannot pump blood efficiently, meaning the body does not get enough oxygen and nutrients. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, a cardiologist specialising in heart failure and heart transplantation, explains that recognising the signs early can save lives. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent fatigue, swelling in the legs or feet, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and a constant cough or wheezing. People at higher risk include those with high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, smokers, and those who consume excessive alcohol. Preventive measures such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet low in salt, avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol, and managing stress can reduce the risk and help protect heart health. Early consultation with a doctor is vital for better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding heart failure and its impact on the body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure doesn't imply that the heart has ceased to function. Rather, it implies that the heart isn't pumping blood as it should to satisfy the body's demands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood delivers oxygen and nourishment to organs and tissues, and when the heart can no longer pump efficiently, the body can't operate at optimal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov points out that heart failure is far more prevalent than most individuals realize. Approximately one in five individuals will eventually develop heart failure sometime in their lifetime. In the United States alone, more than six million individuals have this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure can build up over time or come on suddenly and can be mild to severe. Although it is a chronic illness, with good treatment, individuals can lead longer lives with a good quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which lifestyle change do you think is most effective in preventing heart failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why early detection and treatment are crucial for heart failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov likens heart failure to some forms of cancer due to its urgency. Unless treated properly, figures show that one out of two individuals who are diagnosed with heart failure can not live for more than five years. This indicates the need for early detection of signs and early visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the right treatment, lifestyle changes, and follow-up visits, the prognosis can be quite favorable. Those with heart failure can live longer if they stick to medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of heart failure &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompt identification of signs of heart failure can help a lot. Dr Yaranov recommends that individuals watch out for the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath when exercising or on lying down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-standing fatigue or tiredness that is not relieved by rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leg, ankle, or foot swelling due to fluid accumulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased or irregular heart rate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic cough or wheezing that persists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms happen because the heart is not pumping enough blood. If you experience one or more of these signs, it is necessary to see a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at risk of developing heart failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anyone can get heart failure, there are some factors that make it more likely. These are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure, which makes the heart pump harder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease, which slows the flow of blood to the heart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes, which damages the heart and blood vessels over time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity, which adds extra workload on the heart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking, which harms the heart and blood vessels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive use of alcohol, which may cause the heart muscle to weaken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising these risk factors can allow individuals to take preventive measures against heart failure or catch it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A healthy heart: Prevention tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not all heart failure can be avoided, some lifestyle measures can lower the risk and ensure cardiovascular health. Dr Yaranov advises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a healthy weight through proper diet and regular exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular exercise, both aerobic and strengthening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following a low-salt diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abstaining from tobacco and reducing alcohol intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping stress under control by using relaxation methods, being mindful, or seeking counselling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These choices in lifestyle will assist the heart in functioning better and lower the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a doctor&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis is essential in treating heart failure. If you or your loved one is suffering from sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, or swelling in legs and feet, it is necessary to visit a doctor at once. Early intervention can enhance results and enable individuals to live a good quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov stresses that individuals need to question, know their risk, and act proactively to safeguard their heart.

			&lt;p&gt;New evidence confirms a long-held theory that people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="178283" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; hear 'voices' in their heads by misattributing inner speech as external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This idea's been around for 50 years, but it's been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Thomas Whitford, a psychology researcher at the University of New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt;) to measure brainwaves, Whitford and his colleagues tested the way that the brain reacts to inner speech, and, in people with schizophrenia, the way their brains react to auditory hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-signal-disruptions-behind-voices-in-schizophrenia"&gt;Scientists Identify Brain Signal Disruptions Behind Voices in Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we speak – even just in our heads – the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active," Whitford &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants included 55 people with schizophrenia and recent auditory hallucinations, 44 people with schizophrenia but no recent auditory hallucinations, and 43 people with no history of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort was asked to listen to audio over headphones and to say either 'bah' or 'bih' in their minds at the same time that they heard a sound played. This sound was also either 'bah' or 'bih', but participants did not know if their choice of internally voiced word would match what they heard in their headphones.&lt;br&gt;
When the inner speech matched the external sound, the brains of the participants who had experienced recent auditory hallucinations reacted far more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud," Whitford &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. "But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn't happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it's coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the 'voices' people with schizophrenia hear are their own inner speech, which their brain wrongly perceives as external.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of physical activity don't stop when the movement does. In a new study published in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, Virginia Tech researchers, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Aberdeen and Shenzhen University, have found that being active adds to the total energy you use every day without causing the body to conserve energy in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This is important because the health benefits of increasing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; are already well-documented, but there is less research about how exercise impacts a person's "energy budget," or the allocation of energy to different bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been thought that a person's energy budget functions in one of two ways: like a fixed salary where energy is redistributed from other functions to cover the cost of movement, or like a flexible, commission-based system that is additive and allows for increased &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+expenditure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;. The team wanted to determine which model better explains how the energy budget actually changes across different levels of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, researchers evaluated the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/total+energy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;total energy&lt;/a&gt; expenditure, or the total calories burned in a day, in participants across a wide spectrum of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study found that more physical activity is associated with higher calorie burn, regardless of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+composition/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body composition&lt;/a&gt;, and that this increase is not balanced out by the body reducing energy spent elsewhere," said Kevin Davy, professor in the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise and the principal investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to drink isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen and then to have their urine samples collected over a period of two weeks. Oxygen is eliminated as water and carbon dioxide, and hydrogen is eliminated only as water. The difference in the amount of each isotope lost is proportionate to the amount of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carbon+dioxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; produced, and therefore, to the energy expended. Physical activity was measured using a small sensor worn at the waist that measures motion in multiple directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants' physical activity levels varied widely, from sedentary to ultra-endurance running. There were 75 participants between the ages of 19 and 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of saving energy in one area to make up for the calories burned through physical activity, the study found that the body continues to function at its usual rate, which means that overall energy use rises in direct response to increased movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when the body is maintaining basic functions such as breathing, circulating blood, and regulating temperature, the amount of energy it uses remains stable, the study found. This means the body doesn't obviously compensate or "cancel out" the extra calories burned through activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Energy balance was a key piece of the study," said Kristen Howard, senior research associate at Virginia Tech and the article's lead author. "We looked at folks who were adequately fueled. It could be that apparent compensation under &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/extreme+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;extreme conditions&lt;/a&gt; may reflect under-fueling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also found a clear link between being more active and spending less time sitting still. In simple terms, people who are more physically active are less likely to spend long periods of time being inactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the idea that moving more is associated with burning more may not be such a metabolic myth, despite uncertainty among experts on the topic. Though their findings seem to confirm the additive model, the researchers said there is still room for further work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need more research to understand in whom and under what conditions energy compensation might occur," said Davy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="a4a1138b-f1d2-4c4d-bcd6-a75d76b56a82"&gt;How often do you notice your shoulders creeping up toward your ears? I have to consciously remind myself to exhale, drop my shoulders and straighten my spine several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the more stressed I am, the higher my shoulders seem to rise, until I’m sitting hunched at my desk like a chilly, puffed-up bird, wondering why my neck feels sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="a4a1138b-f1d2-4c4d-bcd6-a75d76b56a82-2"&gt;All that tension has to go somewhere, and for many of us, the neck seems to bear most of the strain. Yoga can be a powerful way to counteract stress and ease discomfort as it works on a physical and mental level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yogawithveronique.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://yogawithveronique.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Veronique Ory&lt;/a&gt;, a yoga instructor who has been guiding students for over a decade through her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yogawithveronique.com/membership/" target="_blank" data-url="https://yogawithveronique.com/membership/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Shine &lt;/a&gt;platform and retreats, explains to &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;why neck pain is a common issue and how yoga can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neck pain often arises from a combination of posture, stress and lifestyle. In our increasingly sedentary world, our shoulders tend to round forward, and the head drifts ahead of the spine,” says Ory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many forms of neck discomfort stem from modern habits, such as long hours at a computer, driving or looking down at a phone—all of which pull your head forward. Yoga can help retrain this alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ory explains that this head-forward posture can eventually cause chronic strain in the upper back, neck and even jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zxCS7RFsjeYgmcujxt4AhX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zxCS7RFsjeYgmcujxt4AhX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even subtle habits like clenching the teeth, shallow breathing or carrying emotional tension can contribute,” says Ory. “Gentle yoga practices that focus on awareness and release can help restore balance, poise and energy flow through the upper body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ory has chosen three gentle postures designed to bring awareness and balance into your body and breath, without exacerbating pain. She’s also incorporated extra support, so have a block, cushion and yoga strap ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-supported-savasana" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-supported-savasana"&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1.

It’s especially soothing for those who hold tension in the jaw or brow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="f4a404cb-4117-4343-acd5-ce68a752461d"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your front with your forearms on the floor and elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a block under your forehead so the ridge of the block rests near your eyebrows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you breathe, feel your body in contact with the floor and the gentle extension in your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-seated-neck-release" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-seated-neck-release"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

    &lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don’t advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the guidelines say help (and don’t help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75 clinical trials to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers produced 59 recommendations. However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1.5g a day for at least four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this just isn’t realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet –  where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn’t help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we now know it’s not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

According to Dr Sudhir Kumar, the real game-changer for your health might just be something you can do right beside your chair — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/squats" target="_blank"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Turns out, taking short &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/exercise" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; breaks during the day can do far more for your heart and blood sugar than one long workout after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sudhir Kumar, a renowned neurologist, recently shared on X that just 10 squats every 45 minutes are more effective in controlling &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/blood-sugar-levels" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; than a single 30-minute walk, especially for those who sit for long hours. He explained that prolonged sitting — whether at your desk or while binge-watching — increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124633975" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that even brief bursts of movement can help undo the damage caused by sitting too long. Short activities like squats or three-minute walks every 45 minutes keep your body active and metabolism in check — something a once-a-day workout doesn’t fully achieve. So, the next time your smartwatch nudges you to “stand up,” maybe throw in a quick round of squats. Your body will thank you more than that post-dinner stroll ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, squats are a fundamental movement that engages multiple muscles and joints, making them one of the most effective exercises for overall strength and mobility. Squats primarily target the lower body — glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors, and calves — while also activating core muscles like the rectus abdominis, obliques, and erector spinae. Advanced variations, such as back or overhead squats, even involve shoulders, arms, and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-grx-impression="Article Recommendations - Edit#articleshow_inline_impression#magazines/panache/forget-long-walks-apollo-neurologist-suggests-one-simple-exercise-you-can-do-at-home-that-can-protect-your-heart-and-sugar-levels | " class="ar_wrp arwd_ld_chk font_mon clr hide custom_ad"&gt;&lt;div class="ar_survey hide"&gt;&lt;p class="ar_back_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="arb_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="ar_lt_arr"&gt;«&lt;/span&gt; Back to recommendation stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124633975" id="div-vdoai-mid-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squats strengthen your core, improve posture, reduce injury risk, and enhance lower-body strength, helping with daily movements like walking, climbing, or lifting. They also burn calories and boost athletic performance, especially with jump squat variations. With countless variations and no equipment needed for bodyweight squats, they’re versatile and can be done anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124633975" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 03:38:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
