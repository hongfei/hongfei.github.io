				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; issued an unusual statement Wednesday regarding a sperm donor who carried a rare genetic mutation that increases the risk of cancer among offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged offspring in their forties and fifties who were born from sperm donations in private clinics in the central region to go directly to one of the genetic institutes across the country for testing as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case began several months ago when the family of a deceased sperm donor informed the Health Ministry that he had Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of developing various cancers, including colon, uterus, stomach, ovaries, and other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deceased had donated sperm at private fertility clinics in central Israel between 1974 and 1985, before regulated sperm banks were established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how many children were born from his donations, but the Health Ministry estimates it could be dozens, or even over a hundred. The offspring themselves do not know who the sperm donor is, but it is known that he donated only at private clinics in the central region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt; The program is part of a national effort to alleviate the Israeli doctor shortage. (Illustrative). (credit: INGIMAGE)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Ministry, the risk of carrying the mutation among children born from these sperm samples is 50 percent. For carriers, there is now a structured medical surveillance program designed to detect cancer at an early stage and thereby save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry called on women and families who received sperm donations during those years in private clinics in the central region to inform their offspring and recommend that they contact one of the 10 genetic institutes across the country directly to check for the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No referral from a doctor is needed, and one can approach directly. The test is not covered by insurance and costs 633 shekels. Those who are found to be carriers will be eligible for full medical treatment, including early detection tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Talia Eldar-Geva, head of the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/fertility"&gt;Fertility&lt;/a&gt; and Reproduction Department at the Health Ministry, said: “We are aware of the complexity of the situation, especially given that some families who received sperm donations 40-50 years ago may have hidden the fact from their offspring, and may now decide to reveal the ‘secret’ only because of this incident. But since detecting the carrier status and then performing all the early detection tests can lead to early diagnosis, early treatment, reduced risk of illness, and sometimes even save lives — the Health Ministry feels obligated to address this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli case joins a series of troubling incidents reported in recent years in Europe and the United States, where sperm donors carried rare genetic mutations that were passed on to their offspring, sometimes without them ever knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the recent European Genetics Conference in Milan, a case was presented of a sperm donor from Europe found to be a carrier of Li-Fraumeni syndrome — a very serious genetic condition that causes a high risk of early-onset cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and brain cancer. That donor fathered at least 67 children in eight different countries, ten of whom have already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation in that case affects the TP53 gene, known as the “guardian of the genome” due to its role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/dna"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage. At the time of donation in the early 2000s, the mutation was not yet recognized as a clear risk factor. But today, with advances in genetic testing, it has been identified as a particularly dangerous mutation, and the lab in France that received the samples determined unequivocally that it is cancer-causing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, all the offspring were referred for genetic testing and regular medical supervision. Ten of them have already been diagnosed with cancer, and 23 others were found to be carriers of the mutation. Medical recommendations include regular MRI scans, breast and abdominal checks, and sometimes even periodic blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the "first lick".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing," said Prof Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: "A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so "further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:48:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE96UXZzbVdpQTZZSjAtMFY0RlVYS3YyNEJ1UncxRjc5SzY0cmpHVGw4N3BiRy1LTHhwLWJ2d1FMR3k5Tjh2NVl1OF9jZkRxQUxRZXk5ZHU5Wi13UdIBX0FVX3lxTE9wSHcyazJkbDF2WEV3Uk51LXZQekpHME4tbHRCcktLYmFLQjZkdlpkUGcwbmFFdW5JLTZmTFdTQ1VTVjNyQURJaGplc1NoTDhZWUVCc2prN01EQnFYMjNR</guid></item><item><title>15种富含视黄醇的食物刺激胶原蛋白- VOGUE | 15 Retinol-Rich Foods To Stimulate Collagen - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1vNm5mei1FblZVRmRHTk54bEI2emFWZ0UtLXl5eHpOeGkzQ2VtQkI3YklHb0tnUXhVbG5hVkVsb08tV0ltT1haREJfcUFrYUFpNklwYlI3cWljX25T?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that topically applying &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/retinol-retinoids-guide-fine-lines-sun-damage-healthy-glow" target="_blank"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt; can make a major difference when it comes to reversing damage to your skin. An active form of vitamin A, retinol is considered the gold-star anti-aging ingredient when it comes to smoothing lines, clearing acne, and reversing sun damage. But you don't have to simply incorporate it into your nighttime routine: Vitamin A is available in your diet, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet plays a significant role in our skin’s health and appearance,” says Manhattan-based board-certified dermatologist &lt;a data-offer-url="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.drdendyengelman.com/"}' href="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dendy Engelman, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;. “There are studies to support that increased vitamin intake helps skin in both the aging space and acne.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how you can take advantage of vitamin A in your diet to improve your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin (more on that later) that is key for a healthy body. “The human body does not produce vitamin A, so it must be obtained externally through our diet and skincare,” Dr. Engelman says. “Retinol, like other retinoids, is a derivative of vitamin A. When applied topically to the skin, it is converted to retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the edible form, vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, which is found in foods that originate from animals, and carotenoids, which are derived from plant-based foods and converted into vitamin A when digested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Appropriate vitamin A intake helps support healthy skin, hair, and nails,” Dr. Engelman adds. “Vitamin A plays a role in regulating sebum production and cell turnover, which are important for maintaining a healthy skin barrier (including the scalp) and supporting the hair growth cycle. Vitamin A is also necessary for the synthesis of keratin, which is a vital structural protein for both hair and nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily requirement of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily vitamin A requirements vary depending on age, sex, and health conditions (if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, that changes it, too). According to the Mayo Clinic, adult males should take 900 micrograms (mcg) and adult women should take 700 mcg. It is important to note that the body does not need large amounts of vitamin A every day, but regular, balanced intake is essential to maintain the right balance and prevent deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A warning about vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that consuming too much vitamin A can actually be very toxic for the human body, leading to a condition known as ‘hypervitaminosis A,’” adds Dr. Engelman. “This can result in a number of unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects—including, ironically, a disrupted and unhealthy skin barrier, and hair loss. Therefore, it is very important to avoid excessive consumption of vitamin A (or any compound!) and speak with your doctor to determine the diet that’s best for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15 vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of liver (especially beef or chicken), which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 cup of fortified dairy products like milk, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;185 mcgs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup cantaloupe, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;135 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 large hard-boiled egg, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;75 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of salmon, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;60 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw carrots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;460 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup spinach, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;570 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw red peppers, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;120 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato with skin, which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;chard, roughly &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1"}' href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 dried sulfured apricots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;65 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;peaches, roughly &lt;a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/sshw/message/message.php?p=Health&amp;amp;m=301" target="_blank"&gt;24 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 whole mango, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;115 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1vNm5mei1FblZVRmRHTk54bEI2emFWZ0UtLXl5eHpOeGkzQ2VtQkI3YklHb0tnUXhVbG5hVkVsb08tV0ltT1haREJfcUFrYUFpNklwYlI3cWljX25T</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么蚊子比其他人更能叮咬某些人的原因- BuzzFeed | So THAT'S Why Mosquitoes Bite Some People More Than Others - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBVck1MUnFfN0ZtUzZmQmVMblQ4NmhCZHAtUEM4bjRHOGM3Q3ZBdkhRazhqMWRBV0FtUlR2N0gyczdlbVlHVWFhX05iLW41ZVNuTjVKdmdETjRUZlU0VnlQU3JUdGxsM284VEpYMlRPNUZ6ckhTNmE2TA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At only 14 years old, Siddarth Nandyala has created a heart disease detection app that can identify early signs of cardiovascular issues in seconds. The app is called Circadian AI, and it could be a powerful tool for early intervention, especially in regions where access to healthcare is limited.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being the leading cause of death worldwide, early symptoms for heart disease often go unnoticed. That’s because diagnosis depends on invasive tests, advanced imaging, or costly procedures that are not accessible to everyone. And this delay can be fatal, as many individuals discover their condition only after a stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Nandyala set out to solve this problem by developing a non-invasive, affordable way to screen for heart abnormalities before serious complications arise. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;According to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.circadian-ai.com/"&gt;Circadian AI&lt;/a&gt; uses the microphone on your smartphone to record a user’s heartbeat. The sound is then cleaned up using advanced noise-cancellation, and analyzed in the cloud using a machine learning model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, the app identifies patterns linked to arrhythmia, heart valve issues, early signs of heart failure, or coronary artery disease.

But it does provide an effective pre-screening tool for early awareness. And, the app has already been tested in clinical settings. Trials in the United States involved approximately 15,000 participants, while additional testing in India included around 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the simple app detected signs of heart disease with over 96% accuracy. Results were later confirmed through traditional diagnostic methods. For now, the app is limited to trained professionals as it undergoes regulatory review and clinical validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nandyala is already working on expanding the heart disease detection app to pick up on lung-related illnesses like pneumonia and pulmonary embolism using similar sound analysis. This is just one more way AI has helped us find new ways to detect deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think about the rise of artificial intelligence, one thing is clear: AI in medicine can be handy. From &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/crazy-new-ai-can-tell-if-youre-sick-just-by-looking-at-your-tongue/"&gt;AI-powered doctors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/doctors-left-a-sick-man-for-dead-but-then-ai-saved-his-life/"&gt;AI that saves lives&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of ways we can put automated systems to work and make life for both doctors and patients easier.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone present in the building (or in any business located within the building) during certain hours is considered likely to have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CCHD said on Wednesday that a person from Hill County came to Great Falls for an appointment on Tuesday, May 27, at Prospect Heights Medical Center (in the vicinity of the 1400 block of Fourth Street South).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the person began experiencing symptoms of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail Hill, the health officer for Cascade County, explained, "Because measles is airborne, because it entered that building, the entire building is considered exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HILL TALKS ABOUT MEASLES EXPOSURE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services says says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of exposure locations associated with the person's visit in Great Falls includes Central Montana Orthopedic Specialists, Sun River Health, Atlas Neurology, the office of Dr. Susan Avery, Quest Diagnostics, and Northwest Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CCHD GUIDANCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may have been exposed but do not receive notice from CCHD within the following several days, you may contact CCHD at 406-791-9242 for directions. Exposed individuals with presumed immunity (see below) do not need to quarantine but should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure; individuals who do not have presumed immunity are advised to stay home for 21 days and monitor for symptoms. Anyone exposed to measles should also talk to their healthcare provider to understand their individual risk of measles and should consider postponing routine medical care at least 21 days from their last exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first symptoms of measles usually appear about 7-14 days after exposure: fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and/or white spots in the mouth. A red rash—usually beginning near the hairline and moving downward—typically begins about 2-3 days after the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, you should continue to stay home except for testing or urgent/emergency treatment. Please call Benefis Health System at 406-731-8300 to arrange for testing or urgent care. It is extremely important that you do not enter a clinic building without calling ahead to the clinic so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are presumed to have immunity to measles if you: have written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); OR laboratory evidence of immunity; OR laboratory confirmation of disease; OR were born before 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of your vaccination status, call CCHD at 406-791-9242 to check your Montana electronic vaccine records and/or for direction on other ways to obtain your records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/CCHDmeasles"&gt;click here to visit&lt;/a&gt; the CCHD website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEASLES IN MONTANA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all 17 cases of measles in the state are Montana residents, and newly-identified cases are isolating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 cases have been reported in four counties in Montana: 10 in Gallatin; three in Hill; two in Flathead; and two in Yellowstone. Two of the cases required hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five cases of measles were reported in Gallatin County in April 2025 - the first confirmed measles cases in Montana since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/4dHKSlc"&gt;Hill County&lt;/a&gt;, the three cases were all unvaccinated children, and all were reported in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yellowstone County cases were an adult and a child — both unvaccinated — who became ill while traveling outside of the country. Those cases were confirmed this week by the Yellowstone County health agency, who said that the two cases had fully recovered and were no longer contagious by the time they returned to Yellowstone County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No details have been released about the two cases in Flathead County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABOUT MEASLES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the DPHHS &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MeaslesDPHHS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPHHS also says that measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected. The agency says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles to others even before he or she develops symptoms—from four days before they develop the measles rash through four days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACROSS THE U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of May, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 1,088 cases spread across 33 states, including Montana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s up from just 285 confirmed cases of measles last year and is the highest number of measles cases our country has seen in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst of the outbreaks has been in the South Plains region of Texas, where more than 600 cases have been reported, most in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that you have measles or may have been exposed to someone with measles, please contact your &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MontanaHealthAgencies"&gt;county or tribal health department&lt;/a&gt; or primary care provider before seeking care, if safe to do so, for instructions about how to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many traditions have used these seeds for their subtle taste and nourishing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-5004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Muhammad H. Alu’datt&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of a recent study on fenugreek and its impact on human health, noted that fenugreek offers a unique combination of macronutrients and minerals that support daily health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that the seeds are especially rich in protein, magnesium, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-chia-seed-packs-a-powerful-nutrient-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which can aid in muscle maintenance, blood sugar control, and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-uses-of-fenugreek-seeds"&gt;Early uses of fenugreek seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek’s history crosses &lt;a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/trigonella-foenum-graecum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;multiple cultures&lt;/a&gt;. Some groups enjoy it as a cooking spice, while others appreciate its practical uses in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, its popularity is growing because newer &lt;a href="https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/glycemic-index-lowering-effects-of-defatted-fenugreek-seed-flakes-fenuflakestm-on-some-indian-food-preparations-a-randomized-controlled-clinical-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest these seeds might promote healthy muscle upkeep. One reason is the protein content, which helps maintain tissues vital for movement or exercise recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; intake is just as important for anyone trying to stay active. Fenugreek seeds offer this mineral in amounts that make it easier to reach the recommended daily target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have associated magnesium with basic metabolic reactions and muscle relaxation. This connection means that those who include fenugreek in their diets might notice fewer nagging muscle strains during busy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fenugreek-packs-a-nutritional-punch"&gt;Fenugreek packs a nutritional punch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek has more than protein and magnesium. The first mention of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/galactomannan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;galactomannan&lt;/a&gt; in fenugreek highlights the presence of a type of soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This component seems to support a balanced digestive system by regulating intestinal movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the seeds also provide additional minerals, like iron and potassium, though &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/magnesium-threonate-is-best-supplement-for-improving-brain-health-says-neurologist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; often takes the spotlight for its role in muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some find fenugreek seeds a bit chewy and slightly aromatic, especially when lightly crushed. Toasting them in a dry pan helps soften their sharper notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who prefer milder textures can soak them overnight and blend them into dips for an easy way to boost daily protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-support-and-normal-digestion"&gt;Muscle support and normal digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet with plenty of protein often supports muscle tissue. Fenugreek participates as an excellent plant-based source that contains amino acids, which may aid in muscle repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dealing with a hectic schedule can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/"&gt;toss &lt;/a&gt;these seeds into rice dishes or soups. Substituting other condiments with crushed fenugreek seeds may enhance taste and add a nutrient advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber in fenugreek seeds also promotes satiety, which can help manage portion sizes. Combined with water, certain components in these seeds expand and encourage a feeling of comfortable fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calmer digestive experience often follows, because fiber is &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.906690/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a steady glycemic response as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is more stable energy, which comes in handy for maintaining an active routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-pointers-for-using-fenugreek"&gt;Everyday pointers for using fenugreek&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground fenugreek powder goes well with marinades or rubs on lean meat. It can also flavor vegetarian stews, giving them a subtle, savory edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prefer a cooled fenugreek “&lt;a href="https://fullleafteacompany.com/pages/what-is-fenugreek-tea-history-benefits-more?srsltid=AfmBOopmdXsVkS1d6fw4b7tTWDF-z15ud4uWYDuOdHXPFxNPH_ZWKWgt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;,” steeped briefly to highlight its mild, nutty essence. Others go for fenugreek sprouts in salads or sandwiches, which add an extra crunch packed with vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alu’datt and colleagues emphasized that moderate daily intake of fenugreek can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/klotho-s-kl-protein-discovered-boosts-lifespan-muscle-brain-power-with-one-dose/"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; support and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended consistent use in small amounts, but cautioned that guidance from a health professional is essential before introducing new ingredients into a regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nursing-mothers-and-fenugreek-seeds"&gt;Nursing mothers and fenugreek seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek may also help women during breastfeeding. In a clinical trial with 78 nursing mothers, those who consumed fenugreek seed tea reported increased milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies in that group showed improved growth in weight, length, and head circumference compared to those in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seed may also play a role in blood sugar balance. Another recent &lt;a href="https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/glycemic-index-lowering-effects-of-defatted-fenugreek-seed-flakes-fenuflakestm-on-some-indian-food-preparations-a-randomized-controlled-clinical-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 62 people with type 2 diabetes showed that taking fenugreek powder twice daily for two months led to reduced blood glucose and body mass index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this effect comes from the seed’s high &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002136.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which can slow sugar absorption and blunt post-meal spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improves-well-being"&gt;Improves well-being&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent bloating or other digestive troubles motivate many individuals to look for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-foods-promote-weight-loss-regardless-of-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant foods&lt;/a&gt; that are less burdensome. Fenugreek’s soluble fiber might soothe common issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can support the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87559120600586315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiota&lt;/a&gt; that line the gut, which may encourage both nutrient absorption and comfort after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many simply appreciate how fenugreek offers variety in the kitchen. Livening up everyday staples with an extra layer of flavor encourages healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds might also suit those exploring legume-based diets, since fenugreek belongs to the same family as lentils and beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sensible-measures-and-professional-advice"&gt;Sensible measures and professional advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults often do well with moderate amounts of fenugreek, but cautious steps are wise for some. If individuals have special conditions, it’s good to speak with a dietitian or physician before altering meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most find no problems when integrating fenugreek into a varied diet. A steady intake of these seeds can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archaeologists-find-hallucinogenic-seeds-in-ancient-bones-black-henbane/"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; a plan that includes quality proteins, vegetables, and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and those who train regularly sometimes find fenugreek beneficial due to its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-high-protein-fruit-prunes-strengthens-muscles-and-bones-in-people-over-45/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high protein&lt;/a&gt; content. It’s considered a simple way to refuel muscles without an abrupt shift in meal routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding water-rich vegetables with fenugreek seeds can also enhance hydration, which is valuable during intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.16970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 23:10:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQSjRjN282ZDZjRGdfRVVmbTFhYmcxamhmMDQxMFNsVm9kWEJ0c01Ka3dCbE94UWVJeFZ6WldIUkRPa0tNcGZUYWtzVG9GOUZJUlEtMElyREVERE1HMHRKZWY3UngtblZOejBJaXVKTTd2MWZBNVFvVzB0S3ptZmg3dndDd1JleU1OLWkzUmNEZV91TzhjdlVucHFfRQ</guid></item><item><title>犹他州卫生官员监测犹他州西南部潜在的麻疹暴露- KSL.com | Utah health officials monitoring potential measles exposure in southwestern Utah - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPTUM1MWRuRG04dTBHWGhFYWdxMTAyemk2QUFtaFpZMEg5VWlWeG13Ym1wWWZCanZmRGFpeW5laXhkQ1VQVjFrQ2FJZEFkRnJ0Y2ZXd21KbU9JN3NGRnVxLWtjNXhzU2hTYTVoSVh6S0lKMXF4OFVzWEJaM2NMVWJWclhLcldtNy0xN2F0TFB2dUlkdFFCMVdYVVNkeWNvUEhYLXZ6dkhubjVpMnZiZjJyV1NvS1c4WlJk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In addition, we know they visited with unvaccinated individuals," the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said the risk to the general population is low, but it wants to inform the public of the "increased risk of measles in this region and the increasing number of cases in surrounding states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the department has limited details about who was exposed but is working to provide information and protection to those it can identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Earlier incident&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest measles case follows closely on the heels of an earlier case that also entered the state last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case first came to light Monday during a Summit County Board of Health meeting. The state health department confirmed that the individual was vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others," the department said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the stay in Idaho, the individual became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to the department. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn't make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic," said Derek Moss, Summit County nursing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed to have passed their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection and said, at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers. Health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's statement from the state health department said that due to the ongoing spread of measles cases throughout the country, public health and medical providers recommend the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the increase in measles spread across North and South America, we encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or health care provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributing:&lt;/strong&gt; Shara Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people are quite concerned about the amount of radiation that comes with a CT scan.  Radiation can increase the risk of cancer down the line… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;but by how much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" title="" target="_blank"&gt;A new study was published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jwatch.org/na58693/2025/04/24/new-estimate-ct-scan-associated-cancer-risk" target="_blank"&gt;updates &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;our best estimates.  As a primary care doc I order my fair share of CT scans, but I always try to make them worth the risk for the patient.  Whenever possible and appropriate I will favor an ultrasound or MRI, but these options are not all equivalent in terms of what they can see, how fast they see it, and how often insurance companies will pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so for this quick boost I’m going to efficiently review the risks of radiation from CT scans as reported in this most recent study.  Then we will briefly review CT versus MRI versus ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope you find this post both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reassuring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alarming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CT scan cancer risk study: key findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This comprehensive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed cancer risks from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;93 million CT scans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; performed on 62 million Americans in 2023 alone, providing updated estimates of radiation-induced cancer risks (using detailed radiation dose data and national utilization patterns).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Individual cancer risk per CT scan&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absolute risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; of developing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single CT scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; varies dramatically by age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infants (&amp;lt;1 year)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Little ones have the highest risk at approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 additional cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (2% absolute risk). Infants under 1 year old have dramatically higher radiation-related cancer risks because their rapidly dividing cells are more susceptible to DNA damage from ionizing radiation, their small body surface area means they receive a higher radiation dose per unit of body weight during CT scans, and they have many more years of life ahead for radiation-induced cancers to develop and manifest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenagers (15-17 years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Much lower at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (0.2% absolute risk), but still more than any of us would like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Risk continues decreasing with age, though specific per-scan rates weren't provided for all adult age groups. The authors emphasize that the risk is highly variable and depends on multiple patient and examination factors.  And yet I decided to go there and I think this calculation from their data is a good ballpark:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;90 million adult CT scans in 2023 were projected to result in 93,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This yields approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.03 cancers per 1,000 adult CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These figures represent the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifetime excess cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a single CT examination, meaning the additional cancer cases beyond what would normally occur in the population.  This linear dose model suggests that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risks are additive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; - meaning:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Relative risk context&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study authors offer a pretty sobering conclusion: if current CT practices continue, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT-associated cancers could account for 5% of all annual cancer diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the United States. This places CT radiation exposure on par with other significant cancer risk factors like alcohol consumption (5.4%) and excess body weight (7.6%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cancer types and demographics&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common projected radiation-induced cancers are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 22,400 cases (70% in women due to higher radiation sensitivity)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colon cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 8,700 cases (59% in men)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leukemia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,900 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bladder cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,100 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 5,700 cases in women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children face higher per-scan risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; but account for only 9,700 of the projected cancers due to lower CT utilization. Pediatricians and pediatric specialists really go out of their way to try other imaging techniques.  Perhaps we should all be doing this more vigorously for adult patients, but it’s tricky (see below).  The most common childhood cancers from CT exposure are estiamted to be thyroid (3,500 cases), lung (990 cases), and breast cancer (630 cases).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High-risk examination types&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abdomen and pelvis CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; pose the greatest population risk, accounting for 37% of projected cancers (37,500 cases) despite representing 32% of examinations. This reflects the higher radiation doses from multi-phase scanning commonly used in these studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Population-level impact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study projects approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;103,000 future lifetime cancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (90% confidence interval: 96,400-109,500) will result &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;from CT scans performed in 2023 alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Sensitivity analyses suggest this number could range from 80,000 to 127,000 cancers depending on various assumptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This represents a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-4 fold increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a similar 2009 analysis that projected 29,000 cancers from 2007 CT use. The increase stems from 30% higher utilization, improved dosimetry methods revealing higher actual radiation doses, and better accounting for multi-phase scanning techniques.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a radiologist, nor an oncologist.  I welcome any dissenting opinions or references.  But as a primary doc trying to keep up with the latest across multiple disciplines, this potential cancer risk as published in a respected journal is by necessity something I need to know, consider at the point of care, and report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key implications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the discussion of this study emphasizes that CT scans are often lifesaving, the massive volume of use (93 million annually) means even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;small individual risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; translate to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;substantial population health impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The authors stress the critical importance of justifying each CT scan and optimizing radiation doses, particularly avoiding unnecessary multi-phase examinations when single-phase scanning would suffice diagnostically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for continued efforts to reduce unnecessary CT utilization while maintaining the significant clinical benefits these examinations provide. Remembering to substitute ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging whenever possible is a good cancer-prevention tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When CT scans are needed&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it were simple, we would order nothing but MRIs and ultrasounds, as these tests do not use ionizing radiation (associated with DNA damage and slightly increased cancer risk).  So here is a quick primer for the layperson that might help in our next discussion with a doc who is about to pull the trigger on an imaging study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are frequently chosen over radiation-free alternatives like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; because they offer unique diagnostic advantages that often outweigh radiation concerns, particularly when evaluating abdominal pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; avoids radiation entirely, it has significant limitations in abdominal imaging due to interference from intestinal gas, operator dependence, and poor visualization through bone or air-filled structures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though excellent for soft tissue contrast and bowel evaluation with specialized techniques like MR enterography, requires 30-60 minutes to complete, may not be readily available in urgent situations, and can be limited by motion artifacts and patient factors like claustrophobia or metallic implants. MRIs often require days to get insurance company authorization, and are much more expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; can comprehensively evaluate multiple organ systems within minutes, providing excellent visualization of bones, soft tissues, and bowel structures regardless of patient body weight or bowel gas. This speed and reliability make CT particularly valuable for detecting time-sensitive conditions like appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pulmonary embolism, or internal bleeding, where rapid diagnosis can be life-saving. If you are in the ER and need imaging, chances are a CT will be ordered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients with vague abdominal pain, like in primary care outpatient settings, CT's ability to simultaneously assess the liver, kidneys, pancreas, bowel, and other structures helps identify serious pathology that might present with non-specific symptoms, often providing definitive answers that guide immediate treatment decisions and avoid prolonged diagnostic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;One sentence conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope this does not scare people into avoiding recommended CT scans, but rather gives some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individual reassurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;population-scale pause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so that we can all be more thoughtful when getting that imaging study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;--—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Among 343 participants, those who had taken classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin reported significantly lower anxiety and PTSD symptoms than those who used other substances or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that certain psychedelics may influence the brain’s processing of trauma, potentially offering insight into new treatment pathways. However, researchers caution that these results do not endorse unsupervised psychedelic use and call for more controlled studies to understand the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower PTSD Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Classic psychedelics were linked to reduced anxiety and trauma symptoms in festival survivors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlled Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held up after accounting for age, gender, psychiatric history, and prior use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution Emphasized:&lt;/strong&gt; Authors stress that this is not a call for recreational use but a prompt for further therapeutic research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking new study conducted by researchers from Reichman University and other Israeli institutions explored the psychological aftermath of the deadly terrorist attack at the Nova Festival in southern Israel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack, which took place on October 7, 2023, claimed the lives of nearly 400 people and left hundreds more physically and psychologically wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110663"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg" alt="This shows people and a swirly background." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.

Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after the massacre, the researchers administered in-person psychological questionnaires to 343 survivors aged 18–64, examining the participants’ mental state, the psychoactive substances they consumed before and during the festival, and the ways those substances may have affected their physical and psychological response to trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety following exposure to war and terrorism is becoming an increasingly pressing global mental health concern, scientific understanding about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of these conditions remains partial and limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, most knowledge in the field is based on research in animal models, rather than on direct evidence from humans exposed to extreme traumatic events — especially not under the influence of mind-altering substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what makes the Nova Festival an exceptional event — it was a real-world situation, as opposed to a laboratory simulation, in which trauma and psychedelics intersected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results remained statistically significant even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, previous psychiatric history, and prior psychedelic use. For example, while the average anxiety symptom score across the entire sample was 1.90, it dropped to 1.38 among the survivors who had taken classic psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zohar Rubinstein of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “This is a powerful example of the simultaneous exposure of almost 4,000 people to a traumatic event on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The survivors’ willingness to cooperate with us during such a difficult time allowed us to examine the effects of psychedelics at a relatively early stage of symptom onset, and in a more natural setting (compared to therapeutic settings). These data are of great clinical importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einat Karp Barnir, a clinical psychologist at the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University, said: “A few days after October 7th, I began volunteering as a clinical psychologist in a healing space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After dozens of conversations I had with survivors, I started to notice that some of those who had been under the influence of certain substances appeared to show milder symptoms — less anxiety and fewer post-traumatic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around the same time, I came across an article claiming that substance use could increase the post-traumatic stress of those who were at the Nova Festival. The discrepancy between what was being said in the media and what I was seeing on the ground sparked the idea for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I contacted Dr. Zohar Rubinstein, and we decided to explore the connection between the type of substance taken at the party and the severity of psychological responses after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At a time when understanding and treating trauma is more relevant than ever, there is still a lack of sufficient information about the factors that influence the formation of traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study sheds light on the differing effects of various substances and contributes to our understanding of how traumatic memories are formed and retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such an understanding could one day not only improve treatment, but even help prevent the development of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Rany Abend of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “What the survivors have given us — through tremendous courage — is a unique glimpse into how mind-altering substances affect the formation of trauma, based on their personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main finding of our study indicates that the brain systems activated by classic psychedelics are involved in the connection between the experience of a life-threatening event, the formation of a traumatic memory, and the emergence of psychological symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of research on this important topic, provides new insights for researchers and therapists, and presents real-world evidence that the use of classic psychedelics may reduce trauma symptoms — an important finding with implications for both research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers emphasize the need for caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings are not intended to encourage the free and unsupervised use of psychedelics, nor do they suggest that such use constitutes a form of treatment,” Dr. Rubinstein clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, they point to potential mechanisms — which need to be further investigated — that may explain how supervised use within an integrative psychological treatment setting may yield therapeutic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p

responses 3 weeks after exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence indicates the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds for post-traumatic stress, yet the mechanisms mediating their effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delineating the effect of psychedelics on traumatic memory formation could shed light on target therapeutic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report on 343 adult survivors of a single, large-scale terrorist attack taking place during a festival in which different psychedelic compounds were consumed, in whom levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms were assessed 3 weeks following the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings indicated that those who were under the influence of classic psychedelics during the attack reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic responses compared to those who were under the influence of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and those who consumed no psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the protective effects of classic psychedelics for post-traumatic responses manifested more strongly among participants who did not consume additional recreational substances alongside psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that pharmacologic targets of classic psychedelics may modulate the formation of enduring trauma memories and confer a protective effect against the development of post-traumatic stress and anxiety responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That accounted for about 95 percent of Hickman Farms' bird population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman held a press conference on May 30 to address the situation. To him, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14530151/government-high-alert-bird-flu-warning-death-sheep.html"&gt;the loss was entirely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If our pullets had been vaccinated when we started lobbying the federal government in January, our pullets would have been saved by now,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman and Hickman Family farms have been advocating for access to avian &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-8f4ed850-417a-11f0-bc8b-09207515360b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since January.&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hickmanseggs.com/notification/"&gt; According to the company's website&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses the situation, the U.S. government makes a vaccine, but only uses it as an export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'European countries have now been vaccinating their flocks for a couple of years and are gaining the upper hand on controlling this disease. That vaccine is actually made here in the U.S., but we export to other countries while our flocks go unprotected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The site encourages customers to contact their representatives in a continued push for access to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman said that the tragic loss of millions of his chickens was preventable &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Hickman's Family Farms plant, one of the biggest egg producers in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'The quicker we can start vaccinating our nation's poultry flock, the quicker we can get back to normalized operations,' said Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman Farms is just the largest of several that have been affected in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On June 2, the Arizona Department of Agriculture confirmed that another farm in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was placed under quarantine. The farm still remains unnamed, but per their press release, poultry began showing symptoms on May and tested positive on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman farms took similar measures to prevent spread, but now is focused on repopulating their farm. According to Hickman, the process of de-populating, cleaning and re-populating will take almost two years. They process will begin in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the mean time, Hickman Farms has stopped operations. Hundreds of their 850 employees are out of the job - many of whom are contract workers and inmates. Fortunately, some employees will still be needed during the cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Customers of Hickman farms and other affected farms in Arizona do not need to be worried about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14658491/Symptoms-bird-flu-pandemic-america-warning.html"&gt;contracting bird flu through consumption&lt;/a&gt;. The AZDA wrote in a press release on May 20 that eggs from chickens who tested positive have not entered food supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There have been no signs of illness in humans,' they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Chickens inside Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC numbers, only 70 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the past 14 months, including one death. The AZDA and the CDC said that humans at highest risk are those who have worked directly with affected poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the outbreak, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/30/hickmans-family-farms-loses-95-arizona-chickens-bird-flu/"&gt;Arizona's Family &lt;/a&gt;reports that for the first time in 81  Hickman Farms will be unable to satisfy all of their customer demand. The company is looking for alternative ways to meet their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone is upset about the decline in operations. 12 News reports that nearby residents are happy to be rid of the stench that comes with operating a chicken farm. &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/hickmans-family-farms-sued-in-federal-court"&gt;According to Fox 10&lt;/a&gt;, locals and environmental activists sued Hickman Farms in 2018 for polluting the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail reached out to Hickman Family Farms and the Arizona Department of Agriculture for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OGDEN — Health officials in Weber and Morgan counties are asking residents to make sure their pets' vaccinations are up to date and to avoid touching bats or other wild animals after a bat found in Morgan County tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bats play an important role in our ecosystem and the majority of the bats in our population are healthy and tend to keep to themselves," said Amy Carter, communicable disease nurse with the Weber-Morgan Health Department. "However, if you see one in the daylight, or if it's in a place where you or your pet can pick it up, there's a good chance it is ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's positive test is the Beehive State's first report of a rabies-positive bat in 2025. Carter added that as the weather warms, the chances for coming across a rabid animal increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a virus that impacts the brain and nervous system of infected animals and can be fatal if not treated properly and promptly — which includes pre-exposure vaccination for pets and post-exposure vaccinations for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, rabies spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (eyes, mouth, or open wounds). Feces, blood and urine do not transmit rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah, bats are the most common carriers of the rabies virus. Skunks, raccoons, foxes and unvaccinated cats and dogs can also carry the disease, but Utah law requires cats and dogs to be vaccinated for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weber-Morgan Health Department provided the following tips when it comes to rabies prevention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pet's vaccinations up to date. Check the pet's vaccination status with your veterinarian and put your records where you can access them quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from wild animals. Call your local animal control for assistance if it appears sick, injured or is acting strangely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act quickly if you are bitten or scratched by a bat or other wild animal. Immediately wash the wound with soap and water and see your health care provider. If possible, safely contain the bat and contact the Utah Division of Wildlife Services so it can be tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any interactions with a bat found in a sleeping area. Any exposure to a bat in a sleeping area is considered an exposure due to their ability to spread the virus through extremely small bites or scratches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is important because it is how we prevent rabies in our cats and dogs.

Since 2019, he has been the CDC’s deputy director of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I think I can do more for the public’s health outside of the federal government at this time,” he said Tuesday about his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In an interview, Butler apologized for being somewhat vague about why he left the CDC. Butler said that “it’s time to move on and do something else.” But he added: “I think when you look at why is it time, you can see what’s going on across the federal government as well as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He did not directly criticize the CDC’s current leadership, or say there was a specific decision under the second Trump administration that drove him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler did, however, express concern about recent mass firings at the CDC and guidance for &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/#:~:text=Workers%20across%20the%20Centers%20for,health%20issues%20beyond%20that%20remit." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;over 2,400 employees&lt;/a&gt; at the CDC were slated to be fired, according to national news reports.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Butler said a lot of experience and expertise was lost at the agency. Younger employees, “inspired by the mission of public health,” were often the first to be fired, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve lost a lot of good people. And truly assets to our nation have been lost. And I think that’s most unfortunate,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is protecting America from diseases and other threats to public health. Butler said it was a “joy” to work there. He said the CDC “is just an incredible blessing to our country and to the entire world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jay Butler, Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer, speaks on stage with U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy during the Wellness Summit at the Glenn Massay Theater on Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016.

(Loren Holmes / Alaska Dispatch News) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said also that “no agency is perfect” and that the past few years have been “challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Asked whether, in his view, there had been examples of problematic political interference at the CDC under the second Trump administration, Butler declined to say. However, he was critical of vaccination guidance from the man now overseeing the CDC and other federal health agencies, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vaccine skeptic who has long amplified &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/12/05/health-care-group-targets-alaska-sen-murkowski-in-effort-to-block-rfk-jr-as-health-secretary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/12/05/health-care-group-targets-alaska-sen-murkowski-in-effort-to-block-rfk-jr-as-health-secretary/"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; about immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t understand some of what is being called science or being called ethics,” Butler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last week, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccine will no longer be recommended for pregnant women or healthy children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said he was particularly “puzzled” by that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“There’s quite a bit of data that supports the safety of COVID vaccines during pregnancy. So that’s one where I think many of us are scratching our heads,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said that he worked early in his career on HIV/AIDS prevention at the CDC. A well-regarded HIV program, credited with saving &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/an-update-on-pepfar-reauthorization/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/an-update-on-pepfar-reauthorization/"&gt;26 million lives&lt;/a&gt;, needs be reauthorized but is currently in limbo. Butler expressed concerns about that and a deteriorating focus on HIV transmission in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not looking at a bright future in terms of HIV control,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In late May, a juvenile in Anchorage &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2025/05/22/anchorage-resident-tests-positive-for-measles-as-health-officials-warn-of-broader-exposure/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;tested positive for measles&lt;/a&gt;. That followed &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/13/the-us-has-over-1000-measles-cases-and-11-states-with-active-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 cases of the virus&lt;/a&gt; being reported across 11 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; on its website that “a highly effective vaccination program” led to the elimination of measles in 2000 in the U.S. However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2025/05/07/opinion-rfk-jrs-measles-strategy-is-leading-the-us-down-a-dark-path/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2025/05/07/opinion-rfk-jrs-measles-strategy-is-leading-the-us-down-a-dark-path/"&gt;has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for not strongly endorsing vaccines as a way to prevent measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said the measles vaccine has had “an excellent track record” for decades. He suggested that could, counterintuitively, be part of the problem for public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’re the victim of our own success. When we’re doing our job well, we’re not in the headlines and people forget. We see that now with measles. We certainly could see it with polio. Things that used to terrify us, we think don’t exist anymore,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said he told the CDC in February he was going to resign. His last day was May 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jay Butler, Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases addresses the media about response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, inside the Emergency Operations Center at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Thursday, Feb. 13, 2020, in Atlanta.

But he said he was “absolutely” happy with the federal agency’s choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He was succeeded by &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2024/02/17/dr-anne-zink-to-resign-as-alaskas-chief-medical-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2024/02/17/dr-anne-zink-to-resign-as-alaskas-chief-medical-officer/"&gt;Dr. Anne Zink&lt;/a&gt; as Alaska’s chief medical officer in 2019.

Thyroid hormone signaling in the amygdala—the part of the brain involved in processing emotions—was not only activated by fear learning, but also necessary for storing fear memories. Boosting thyroid hormone activity strengthened fear memories, while blocking it impaired them. These results may help uncover new treatment pathways for trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is known to be essential for learning to associate danger with a particular stimulus—such as a tone paired with a shock in laboratory settings. This process, known as Pavlovian fear conditioning, has long been used in animal research to study the brain’s response to threat. Meanwhile, the thyroid hormone system has traditionally been associated with metabolism and early brain development. But it is increasingly being linked to mood, anxiety, and memory. Still, researchers have had limited understanding of how thyroid hormones influence the adult brain’s ability to store emotionally significant memories—especially in brain regions like the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormones such as triiodothyronine (T3) interact with specific receptors in the brain called thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). These receptors act as transcriptional regulators: when they bind to T3, they turn on genes that help regulate brain plasticity—the brain’s ability to adapt based on experience. In their unbound state, these receptors suppress gene activity. This dual function makes them a promising target for exploring how hormones can shape emotional learning at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the research team focused on mice undergoing fear conditioning. The study used a widely accepted experimental procedure: mice were exposed to a tone followed by a mild foot shock, creating an association between the two. Researchers examined whether genes involved in the thyroid hormone pathway were activated in the amygdala following this learning event. They also tested whether directly manipulating thyroid hormone activity in the amygdala would influence fear memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved several sets of experiments. In one, the researchers surgically implanted tiny cannulas into the amygdala of adult male mice. These cannulas allowed them to precisely deliver thyroid hormone T3 or a TR antagonist—either before or after the mice experienced tone-shock pairings. The goal was to observe whether adding or blocking hormone signaling in this brain region would enhance or impair the consolidation of fear memories, which is the process by which short-term memories become stable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that administering T3 directly into the amygdala led to stronger fear memories, as measured by increased freezing behavior when the tone was later played. In contrast, blocking thyroid receptors with an antagonist drug weakened fear memory. These changes were not due to differences in how mice learned during the training session itself, but rather reflected how well they retained the memory afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In additional experiments, the researchers created a hypothyroid state in mice by feeding them a low-iodine diet combined with a chemical that blocks thyroid hormone production. As expected, these mice showed lower levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. They also had impaired fear memory. Remarkably, the researchers were able to reverse this memory deficit by injecting T3 into the amygdala, confirming that local hormone signaling in this specific brain region was enough to rescue the behavioral impairment caused by systemic hormone deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined which specific genes in the amygdala were regulated by thyroid hormones during fear learning. Using a technique called quantitative PCR, they identified several genes whose activity levels changed following fear conditioning. These included both genes that are usually activated by T3 (such as Dio2 and Reln) and genes that are typically suppressed (such as Trh and Aldh1a3). These transcriptional changes were consistent with the idea that thyroid hormones help coordinate the brain’s molecular response to threat, priming it for storing emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a type of imaging called RNAscope to validate that some of these genes were being turned on in the amygdala itself, not in nearby regions. They also confirmed that these changes happened within hours of fear learning, suggesting a direct link between hormone signaling and the early phases of memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory, the researchers also tested how amygdala thyroid hormone activity influenced anxiety-related behaviors. In a separate open field test, mice given T3 in the amygdala spent less time exploring the center of the arena and showed less movement overall. These behaviors suggest an increase in anxiety-like responses, aligning with the idea that thyroid hormones can influence emotional arousal beyond memory alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study provides strong evidence that the thyroid hormone system is a dynamic and influential player in the adult brain’s emotional memory network. While past research has linked thyroid dysfunction to mood disorders like depression and anxiety, this study offers a direct mechanism by which thyroid hormones affect how emotionally significant events are encoded and remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also raise intriguing possibilities for clinical research. Thyroid hormone levels are not routinely measured in patients with PTSD or trauma-related symptoms, despite known associations between stress and thyroid function. If future research supports these findings in humans, thyroid hormone regulation could become a target for novel therapies aimed at preventing or modifying fear-related memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study has limitations. All of the experiments were conducted in male mice, leaving open questions about whether the same results would apply to females. The researchers also focused on relatively short time frames, mainly testing memory 24 hours after learning. It remains unclear how long the observed effects of T3 or its antagonists last, or how these hormone pathways interact with other known regulators of memory such as serotonin, dopamine, or stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work could explore whether the same hormone pathways are involved in more chronic or generalized anxiety, and whether targeting these pathways could improve treatment outcomes in individuals with trauma-related disorders. Researchers may also investigate how early life stress interacts with thyroid signaling in the brain, potentially helping to explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to the long-term effects of trauma than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02679-2" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of amygdala dependent fear-relevant memory and plasticity&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Stephanie A.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study has found a startling link between chronic cannabis use and increased risk of cardiovascular disease—regardless of whether you smoke it or consume edibles. The finding challenges commonly held beliefs about the health impacts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which many see as a relatively harmless drug—especially when ingested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, published Wednesday, May 28 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2025.1399"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found that THC smokers suffer from significantly worse artery function than non-users. They observed the same effect in edible consumers, though their arteries were not as severely affected. In either case, vascular function was reduced by roughly half compared to those who do not use cannabis, according to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/05/430051/whether-its-smoking-or-edibles-marijuana-bad-your-heart"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Scientifically, this THC result is really interesting but boy does it screw up the public health messaging,’” co-author Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cannabis/article/ucsf-cannabis-heart-health-risks-20349621.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly said to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author and UCSF physician-scientist Leila Mohammadi when he saw the data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These results add to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cannabis-use-marijuana-surgery-anesthesia-study-1849966607"&gt;&lt;span&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that suggests long-term weed use can lead to cardiovascular damage and life-threatening events such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/synthetic-weed-may-cause-heart-attacks-but-its-tough-t-5926944"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and strokes, though experts still lack consensus on its precise impacts. A 2024 study published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030178"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that people who consume cannabis daily had a 25% increased risk of heart attack and a 42% increased risk of stroke compared to non-users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this new study, researchers investigated how cannabis impacts vascular function. To isolate the effects of chronic cannabis use, they recruited 55 otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 who did not use any form of nicotine and were not frequently exposed to secondhand smoke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These participants were sorted into three groups: marijuana smokers, edible users, and non-users. Those in the two cannabis user groups reported taking the drug at least three times per week, either exclusively through smoking or edibles.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To assess the participants’ vascular function, the researchers measured dilation of the brachial artery—located in the upper arm—to determine whether it could properly expand in response to increased blood flow. To that end, they used an inflatable forearm cuff to briefly block blood flow to the artery, then used ultrasound to measure its diameter before and after inflating the cuff. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF whose lab led the study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/marijuana/weed-may-be-bad-for-your-heart-whether-you-smoke-or-consume-edibles"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Live Science that his test offers a “window into the future.” When blood vessels cannot fully dilate, he said, the risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants who did not consume cannabis showed an average vessel dilation—represented as the percent change from the baseline measurement of artery diameter—of 10.4%. This value was significantly reduced among weed smokers and edible users, who showed an average vessel dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. For reference, average values for brachial artery dilation in healthy individuals typically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4324696/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from 8.0% to 15%. In a previous study, Springer’s lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; similarly reduced levels of vessel dilation among e-cigarette and cigarette smokers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To better understand how THC causes this change, the researchers ran lab tests to determine how endothelial cells—which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26848/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the linings of blood vessels and release nitric oxide to trigger dilation—responded to the participants’ blood samples. These tests revealed that the blood of chronic cannabis smokers inhibited nitric oxide production in the cells, which may explain why these participants showed reduced vessel dilation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This effect was not observed in edible consumers, however, suggesting that ingestible THC may impact arterial function via an entirely separate mechanism. Figuring out what that mechanism may be will require further research. What’s more, subsequent studies will need to reproduce these findings in a larger population to validate the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the last several years, cannabis use among U.S. adults has reached new heights, according to the NIH’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/08/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-use-among-adults-remained-at-historic-highs-in-2023"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As such, investigating the health effects of THC is more important than ever before—especially as mounting evidence challenges perceptions of weed as a harmless high. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking archaeological discovery has been made, where more than 850 Paleolithic artifacts, including hand axes dating back up to 1.5 million years, were uncovered. The findings, made with just the naked eye, provide invaluable insight into the ancient tools of early human ancestors, highlighting a significant era of toolmaking during the Paleolithic period. This discovery was made possible by a collaborative project led by Dr. Ella Egberts of&lt;a href="https://press.vub.ac.be/vub-researcher-discovers-hand-axes-that-may-go-back-15-million-years-ago-in-iraqi-desert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)&lt;/a&gt;, Jaafar Jotheri of the &lt;a href="https://en.qu.edu.iq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Al-Qadisiyah&lt;/a&gt;, and independent researcher Andreas Nymark, alongside local researchers in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Impact of Ancient Water Sources&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were discovered in an area that once hosted a large Pleistocene lake, offering clues about early human life in the region. The dry desert terrain, now far from any major water sources, was once crisscrossed with fossilized river channels, signaling that it played a vital role in the survival of early human populations. This was not just a desert landscape but a lifeline for humans who might have relied on these ancient waters for sustenance and migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ella Egberts and her team conducted a pilot project in this area to explore surface materials scattered across the landscape. &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/archaeologists-iraqs-ancient-megastructure/" data-type="post" data-id="82323"&gt;This specific region in Iraq,&lt;/a&gt; marked by ancient water beds, holds exceptional potential for understanding how humans interacted with their environment. The large area of discovery (about 10 by 20 km) helped uncover several Paleolithic sites, where the tools were initially spotted and then studied in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Early Humans and Their Simple Tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the most significant discoveries were the &lt;strong&gt;hand axes&lt;/strong&gt;, which date back to the Early Paleolithic period. These tools, some of which could be as old as 1.5 million years, demonstrate the early stages of human toolmaking. Early humans would have used these tools for essential tasks like hunting, processing food, and surviving harsh conditions. The discovery of these &lt;strong&gt;Old Paleolithic&lt;/strong&gt; materials indicates that early humans had already begun shaping their environment, albeit with relatively rudimentary tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fieldwork was a huge success,” confirms Dr. Egberts. “Our targeted fieldwork resulted in the discovery of seven Paleolithic sites in an area of 10 by 20 km. One location was selected for a systematic study to determine the spatial distribution of the Paleolithic material and to conduct preliminary technological and typological analyses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These early tools, such as the hand axes, have given archaeologists a deeper understanding of the timeline of human evolution and survival strategies. However, the discovery doesn’t stop there—more advanced tools were also found at the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Hand Axes to Levallois Flakes: A Leap in Human Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans advanced their tool-making techniques significantly. During the &lt;strong&gt;Middle Paleolithic&lt;/strong&gt;, they developed a more organized and sophisticated way of shaping stone tools. The &lt;strong&gt;Levallois technique&lt;/strong&gt;, where a stone core is carefully shaped to produce specific flakes, is one such example. This method shows that early humans were not only more precise in their craftsmanship but also able to plan and anticipate their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Levallois flakes in the region offers a fascinating insight into the cognitive and social development of early human groups. As Egberts explains, “Based on the distribution of the sites and the advancing understanding of the region’s geomorphological history, there are emerging clues of early human landscape use. In the future, I hope to expand my research to a larger area, systematically sample all the sites, and conduct in-depth technological and typological artifact analysis. The new insights we bring from Iraq will then be integrated into the broader understanding of human evolution and behavior on the Arabian Peninsula.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The transition from hand axes to more advanced tools reflects the changing needs of human societies as they adapted to their environments and developed new methods of survival and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Training Future Generations: Knowledge Transfer in the Field&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key part of Dr. Egberts’ project was her commitment to fostering the next generation of archaeologists. Throughout the study, she led workshops and field training for local students from &lt;strong&gt;Al-Qadisiyah University&lt;/strong&gt;. These hands-on experiences allowed students to engage directly with ancient artifacts and gain valuable skills in archaeological techniques. It also provided them with the opportunity to analyze the surrounding soils and understand the intricate layers that have preserved these ancient materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaafar Jotheri, one of the local researchers involved, stated that this collaborative fieldwork “provided invaluable learning opportunities for students who gained firsthand experience handling Paleolithic items and analyzing the surrounding soils.” This aspect of the project demonstrates the importance of collaboration and knowledge-sharing in preserving archaeological heritage, while also fostering the skills necessary for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This delicious recipe is not only an ample opportunity for adding ingredients to tailor it to your own tastes, but it delivers the nutrients you need to improve your cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is one of the most effective nutrients for lowering LDL cholesterol, and this recipe delivers 17 grams of dietary fiber per serving. Black beans are the star here, packed with soluble fiber that binds with cholesterol in your digestive system and helps remove it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fiber, especially from beans and veggies, helps lower LDL cholesterol. The beans and peppers in this recipe are good sources of fiber,” says &lt;a href="https://www.clairerifkinnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Claire Rifkin, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit of eating a meal with fiber is that you will stay full for longer. The fiber in food sets off a chain of responses that ultimately decrease ghrelin, the hunger hormone, and increase leptin, a hormone that helps regulate metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding even more veggies to this recipe increases the fiber content even further and introduces different flavors and textures. Additionally, it enhances the micronutrient nutrition profile. You can customize this recipe in so many ways with the flavors you love most.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This lunch uses olive oil, an unsaturated fat that’s been shown to help reduce LDL levels. Olive oil isn’t just a swap—it’s an upgrade. Rich in monounsaturated fats, olive oil and other heart-healthy fats may help protect against cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One opportunity for adding even more unsaturated fat to this recipe would be to top it with sliced or mashed avocado after the fajita skillet is cooked. “I’d add sliced avocado for healthy fats and plate it on greens for extra fiber. These add-ons would make the meal more heart-healthy and also help you stay fuller for longer,” says Rifkin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While everything in moderation is good, research shows that excessive saturated fat can increase your LDL cholesterol, contributing to plaque buildup in your arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Red meat, full-fat dairy and fried foods are common sources of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Saturated fat in this recipe comes from the optional cheddar cheese, and even that is limited to 2 tablespoons per serving. For those especially concerned with cholesterol, you can simply skip the cheese or opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024093/best-low-fat-cheeses/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower-fat alternative&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a lunch to help support healthy cholesterol levels, Rifkin recommends focusing on the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich in Whole Grains&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and buckwheat, can help lower cholesterol levels. Whole grains can increase the amount of bile your body produces, which has the effect of lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in Saturated Fat&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to limit your intake of sources of saturated fats, such as butter, cheese, cream, coconut oil and fatty meats. The American Heart Association recommends keeping your saturated fat intake below 6% of your total daily calories. So for a 2,000-calorie diet, that’s no more than 120 calories or 13 grams of saturated fat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High in Heart-Healthy Fats&lt;/strong&gt;: Ingredients such as olive oil, avocado, nuts and fatty fish contain heart-healthy fats that can raise HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol and lower LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packed with Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods like beans, lentils, oats and vegetables help lower LDL cholesterol by binding to it in the digestive system. Aim for meals that provide at least 6 grams of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in Trans Fat&lt;/strong&gt;: While artificial trans fats have largely been removed from the food supply following an FDA ban, small amounts of trans fat occur naturally in animal products, such as beef, lamb and cheese.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Although our sex is determined at the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg, it is not until a month and a half later that the biological programming to develop testes or ovaries is activated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Textbooks have always taught that this process is 100% dictated by genetics: males have one female and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html"&gt;one male chromosome&lt;/a&gt;, XY, and females have &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;two female chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, XX. But on Wednesday, the results of a bold experiment with mice were published, showing that very low iron levels in the mother can transform males into females, regardless of their genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an environmental factor can influence sex determination in a mammal,” &lt;a href="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6"&gt;Makoto Tachibana&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Osaka University in Japan and leader of the research, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2"&gt;journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells EL PAÍS. “The most important implication of this finding,” he adds, “is that environmental and metabolic conditions influence fundamental developmental decisions that until now were thought to be strictly determined by genetics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Almost four decades ago, the study of people born with ovaries despite being genetically male (XY), and vice versa — a rare genetic disorder — led to the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html"&gt;SRY gene&lt;/a&gt;. This genetic fragment within the male Y chromosome is the main factor responsible for sexual differentiation in mammals. If the gene is present, the gonads begin to form testes at six weeks of development; if not, they inevitably become ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This process also initiates the production of sex hormones and the activation of other genes that produce more physical traits characteristic of each sex. All this happens in the highly protected environment of the uterus, safe from environmental interference. Mammals are unusual in this respect, since many animals determine their sex based on temperature, social hierarchy, size, or parasites infecting the mother, as occurs in some&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html"&gt; reptiles, fish, and insects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The researchers discovered that if iron concentration is reduced by 60% at the cellular level, the testicular gene is switched off. When they reproduced this iron deficiency in pregnant female mice carrying males, they observed that six out of 39 XY offspring were born with two ovaries, a complete sex reversal. Another mouse was born intersex, with one ovary and one testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The same happened in another set of experiments, where they studied the morphology of embryos from mothers treated with a drug that sequesters iron from the body: five out of 72 males developed female sexual organs. Although these numbers of sex reversal might seem small, it is an undeniable effect on a fundamental developmental mechanism previously thought to be shielded from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The study details how an external factor ends up influencing the fetus’s genetics. It is through epigenetics, a collection of chemical marks sensitive to environmental factors located on the genome that modify its functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Extremely low iron affects the enzyme KDM3A, which modifies a chemical change that turns off the testis-producing gene SRY right at the moment of sex determination. The result is genetically male mice with two ovaries that lived apparently healthy up to eight weeks, although it has not been studied whether they could reproduce — in humans, sex reversal usually leads to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Iron deficiency in the body, which can cause anemia, is a health risk for both the mother and the baby. This deficiency is usually not severe and can be corrected on its own or by eating iron-rich foods such as cockles. However, in more severe cases, it must be treated, as it can increase the risk of miscarriage, perinatal mortality, and susceptibility to infections in the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Makoto Tachibana" decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Makoto Tachibana, center back row, with the rest of his team from Osaka University in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;M. T.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“At this point, we don’t know if a similar process could occur in humans,” says Tachibana. While he believes it would be difficult to find such low iron levels in nature, he argues “it’s a very important question that deserves to be investigated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez"&gt;Francisco Javier Barrionuevo&lt;/a&gt;, professor of genetics at the University of Granada in Spain, who did not participate in the study, highlights its importance. “Discovering that something as mundane as iron concentration can cause a mammalian embryo to develop as a female is spectacular,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;His team is investigating several biological components that can interfere in this process, including one they discovered very recently: tiny RNA sequences with no apparent function that are nevertheless capable of causing a complete sex reversal. In this case, the biologist warns, it is even more surprising because it is an external element not linked to the genetic code. Barrionuevo returns to the question raised by his Japanese colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Something like this has never been described in humans, as the study itself explains, but I think it could have happened in cases of extreme malnutrition and simply gone undetected,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7"&gt;op-ed published alongside the study&lt;/a&gt;, cellular biologists Shannon Dupont and Blanche Capel, from Duke University in the United States, celebrate the “impressive series of experiments.” This study “provides clear evidence that variations in metabolism in the controlled uterine environment interface with the genetic sex-determination cascade and affect testis development,” state the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Chapel and Dupont note that iron deficiency is a known factor that can affect the health of both the mother and the baby, potentially impacting their neurological development. Following this line of thought, they wonder what other more subtle effects this deficiency might have, which opens up the possibility that the mother’s diet could affect not only the formation of testes but also other traits of “masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:39:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>KRVN 880 – KRVN 93.1 – KAMI –内布拉斯加州西南部Tularemia病例增加-农村无线电网络 | KRVN 880 – KRVN 93.1 – KAMI - Increase in Tularemia cases in southwest Nebraska - Rural Radio Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUEVLdU9HVDh3OFdmMzNZaEVfS3VVRE4zUXhTZ1VSQVBlWjBmTUJYY0R0U0ItM0NPVE82M3pzUkVJYWYwdDgyMUluMHRvU18xcUoyS3hZc3c0cFIxcHlkb1dEZjBYMkFIMHY5S1FLOUt2VjdZdEZ6VmVKNEY0a3RvbFN2ZUNpX2xpTmR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
				
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department (SWNPHD) has received reports of three cases of tularemia in the health district over the past month.  Tularemia can be spread by tick bites, deer fly bites or contact with infected animals such as wild rabbits. Tularemia can be prevented by wearing insect repellant and keeping a safe distance from wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a concerning number of cases for this tickborne disease,” explains Melissa Propp RN, Clinic Manager at SWNPHD. “Only 6 cases of tularemia were reported to us during the past 10 years, so getting three cases in a month is unusual. We encourage everyone to take extra precautions to avoid tick bites.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tularemia is caused by bacteria that get into the body when someone is bitten by an infected tick or touches an infected rabbit or rodent. The symptoms are fever, headache, swollen glands in the armpit or groin, and skin ulcers at the site of the bite. Tularemia can be life-threatening, but most infections are treated successfully with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to prevent tularemia:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use bug spray that prevents tick bites with DEET or other EPA-approved ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use permethrin on tents and camping gear to repel ticks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep a safe distance from wild rabbits and other rodents.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If you need to handle wild animals, use gloves and wash your hands well afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are bitten by a tick, follow safe tick removal steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasp the tick close to the skin with tweezers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pull the tick straight out, do not twist or bend.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Flush it down the toilet or wrap it in tape and throw it away.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean the bite with soap and water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avoid squeezing the body of the tick and do not use creams or chemicals to try to make it remove itself, as that could make it push infected fluid into the skin. Contact your healthcare provider right away if you develop symptoms after being bitten by a tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may get different illnesses depending on the type of tick and where it lives. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released information in May through the Health Alert Network (HAN) about all the tickborne diseases that are in Nebraska, including tularemia.  The  HAN is used for sharing important and timely information about public health, and can be found at &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__dhhs.ne.gov_han-2520Documents_UPDATE05052025.pdf&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=1esu62z7Uv4v2qQXJJmIyz_upa5BwzG_yY5cXDaVgac&amp;amp;m=uPkr-w89Wx9inhRBWNSPhscnkwBKgXmHxJ9IBP8Fr3SOphv8pKR9zGW775xDqGNE&amp;amp;s=0_uha1lJSApeTHjOfn0rmGjr5f5hu8ICQMDgRBEqoSI&amp;amp;e="&gt;dhhs.ne.gov/HAN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

No cases have been reported in the state since. The Associated Press has reported, citing state records, that testing efforts have &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:“fallen off;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;“fallen off&lt;/a&gt;.” During 2024 at least 50 people were tested per month, compared with three people tested in March, one in April and none in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In recent weeks, the overall number of new animal H5N1 virus infections reported by [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] has declined, reducing the number of people exposed to infected animals, and human cases have declined as well,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While there’s the possibility that the H5N1 virus is waning in the U.S. for the time being, experts are worried that the efforts to monitor bird flu infections is the factor that’s actually waning. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, is worried because while these latest cases have been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/top-doctors-warn-bird-flu-180403844.html" data-ylk="slk:relatively mild;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;relatively mild&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has been “quite deadly,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22401-bird-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:historically speaking;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;historically speaking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Of the known human cases that have been identified, about half of them have died, Nuzzo told Yahoo News, “and that is a truly staggering percentage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Nuzzo and Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, in an effort to gain some insight as to why those CDC case numbers haven’t budged in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-havent-we-seen-an-increase-in-human-bird-flu-infections-since-february"&gt;Why haven’t we seen an increase in human bird flu infections since February?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The short answer is, we don’t know,” Nuzzo said. But experts like her have offered some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Migratory bird patterns have changed: &lt;/strong&gt;Wild birds are primary spreaders of avian flu. The United States could be experiencing a natural and temporary decline in human cases, which tend to peak in the fall and early winter, possibly because migration patterns have seasonally changed as well, a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:CDC official;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CDC official&lt;/a&gt; noted during a May call with U.S. doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As we expect to see bird migration patterns rev back up here in the next few months, I suspect we're going to see increased levels of H5N1 in migratory birds,” Hopkins said. “That's probably going to result in more poultry flocks and more other animals infected. I think that again raises our risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It’s possible that less of the virus is circulating: &lt;/strong&gt;Humans can become infected with bird flu through exposure to sick wild birds, poultry, backyard flocks or cattle. Avian flu infections are still being detected in birds and cattle but not as frequently as they were several months ago. “Since February 2025, there have been fewer affected dairy herds and commercial poultry flocks in the United States, and we believe, fewer workers are being exposed to sick animals,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Testing at the state and local levels for H5N1 has decreased:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuzzo suggested that perhaps there has been an overall reduction in human testing for H5N1, rather than a decrease in viral spread. “One of the concerns that I have is that states have appeared to be conducting just less general testing for H5N1,” Nuzzo said. “Those things coupled with a general lack of any communication from federal agencies about H5N1 leaves us very concerned that what we might be seeing is just a contraction of surveillance and not necessarily an abatement of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News that the agency’s “guidance and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/h5-monitoring/index.html__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!E4kaX89TX2EXsGuaieeDHQOm01gjhgmJHZikqAM4Mx_eZlAl7vHaw4hmbgWj_sXdV-oD7Se9VREdxNcv$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:surveillance efforts;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; for human cases of H5N1 virus infections have not changed. State and local health departments continue to monitor for illness in persons exposed to sick animals. However, no new human cases of H5N1 virus infections have been identified and reported to CDC in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Less prevalence in wastewater surveillance: &lt;/strong&gt;People who contract bird flu can shed pieces of the virus through wastewater, like from handwashing, bathing or laundering clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC website;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt; notes, “Wastewater data cannot determine the source of influenza A viruses.” Nuzzo agrees that wastewater surveillance alone isn’t the best method in determining whether human bird flu infections are waning but “probably the best thing we have in terms of figuring out how much virologic activity is occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hopkins says the presence of H5N1 showing up in wastewater surveillance has slowed. “So less virus means less transmission,” Hopkins said. “They are positive factors for right now, and they don't mean that we won't have greater problems going forward,” he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the week ending May 24, out of 340 sites nationwide as part of the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System, there were 17 sites, in New Jersey and Oregon, that reported any detection of H5N1, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The current virus strain isn’t good at infecting humans: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC has confirmed;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; instances of bird flu that have passed from birds to animals, from birds to humans and from animals to humans. What about human to human?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It appears that this H5 virus has not developed the mutations necessary to easily transmit to humans and to easily transmit from person to person because we don't have any confirmed person-to-person spread either,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="experts-worry-federal-government-cuts-could-decrease-bird-flu-monitoring-in-humans"&gt;Experts worry federal government cuts could decrease bird flu monitoring in humans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s my deep fear,” Nuzzo said. “I do know there have been concerns about attention on [bird flu] from the agricultural sector, in part due to USDA cuts and letting go of the staff who worked on H5N1.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce, more than 15,000 USDA employees have taken one of two financial incentives to leave the agency. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:Three of 14 experts;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Three of 14 experts&lt;/a&gt; responding to disease outbreaks at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network are among the staff that have accepted the offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nuzzo said even before the cuts, experts like herself were concerned that states weren’t being aggressive enough in responding to H5N1 either because they didn’t think it was a problem or because it was on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In 2024, federal agencies regularly held briefings on the topic with both outside experts like myself, but also state and local health officials,” Nuzzo said. “I think absent that, it's just hard to know what is going on, and it's hard to not assume that things aren't going on. It also makes it hard to say, one way or another, how much of an issue [bird flu] is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-the-general-public-be-concerned-about-bird-flu-right-now"&gt;Should the general public be concerned about bird flu right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC says;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; the current risk to the general public is low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Right at this moment, Nuzzo said, the general public shouldn’t be worried about bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The people that I'm worried about are people who are being exposed to infected animals,” Nuzzo said, “and that's largely people in the agricultural sector, the farm workers who have disincentives for coming forward if they become infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Immigration labor accounts for 51% of all dairy labor, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.nmpf.org/issues/labor-rural-policy/labor-and-immigration-reform-efforts/#:~:text=Immigrant%20labor%20accounts%20for%2051,economy%20more%20than%20$32%20billion." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Milk Producers Federation;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Milk Producers Federation&lt;/a&gt;.

Based on data from over 5,000 gamers worldwide, the research found that the “dysregulated” and “relational” profiles were associated with greater psychological distress and insecure attachment patterns, while the “avoidant” and “engaged” profiles were linked to emotional stability and healthier relationships with gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers affiliated with ISPA – Instituto Universitário and the APPsyCI Applied Psychology Research Center conducted the study to better understand the complex factors that shape gaming behavior. While video games are a popular form of entertainment for people of all ages, concerns have grown about the potential for excessive or problematic gaming, especially in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health challenges, substance use, attachment difficulties, and social environments can all contribute to how individuals engage with video games. However, many studies to date have focused on narrow aspects of gaming, such as time spent playing or clinical symptoms, without considering the broader psychological and social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was born from a shared interest in understanding the psychological complexity of gaming behaviors, particularly in the context of Gaming Disorder, but we also wanted to know about non-problematic gaming behaviors,” said study authors Cátia Martins Castro (a PhD candidate in psychology) and David Dias Neto (an associate professor of psychology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the primary motivations was the desire to integrate the most relevant psychological factors — emotional regulation and motivation to play videogames — into profiles, and then comprehend the various dimensions, such as attachment styles, mental health, and gaming characteristics related to these profiles, that could one day support clinicians in their practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a personal perspective (Cátia), this need was strongly felt in my clinical work, where it was often difficult to translate research into practical tools for assessing and supporting my clients who were gamers with problematic use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also committed to ensuring inclusivity, both in terms of the types of games played and the diversity of the gaming population,” the researchers explained. “These are, to our knowledge, the first psychological profiles of gamers to include non-binary participants, to be generalizable across all game genres, and to be drawn from an international sample spanning 112 countries. This breadth gives the profiles substantial potential for clinical and cultural relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, their aim was to explore how mental health indicators, social and relational dynamics, and gaming-specific behaviors cluster together to form meaningful patterns among gamers. They focused particularly on how emotional regulation and motivations for gaming vary across profiles and how these profiles relate to risk factors for problematic gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study drew on responses from 5,255 individuals aged 16 to 69, with a mean age of approximately 25. Participants came from 112 countries and identified as men (about 50%), women (43%), or non-binary (9%). Data were collected through an online questionnaire shared on social media and gaming platforms. Participants answered questions about their gaming habits, emotional experiences, social connections, substance use, and attachment patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the psychological profiles, the researchers used a person-centered statistical approach that groups individuals based on similarities across multiple variables. They measured emotional regulation using a standardized scale assessing impulse control, emotional awareness, and the ability to act in goal-directed ways despite distress. They also assessed gaming motivations, such as playing for escapism, identity, or social connection. In addition, they examined attachment styles—patterns of relating to others developed early in life—as well as self-reported mental health symptoms and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed four distinct gamer profiles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoidant profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals in this group were generally older and reported low levels of psychological distress. They showed secure attachment patterns and a preference for offline social interactions. Their gaming motivations centered around personal exploration, autonomy, and recreation rather than social connection. This profile was also associated with lower levels of substance use and minimal use of social media for gaming-related communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaged profile:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the largest group and included gamers with good emotional regulation and secure attachment. Like the avoidant group, they showed low psychological distress and little substance use. However, they were more socially integrated into gaming communities and used platforms such as Discord, Twitch, and Instagram to connect with others. Smartphone gaming was common in this group. While they did not often play online games with others, they maintained strong offline social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relational profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Members of this group showed emotional regulation difficulties and higher levels of attachment avoidance. They were more likely to play games for social connection and identity reinforcement but had fewer offline social interactions. Although they experienced some functional impairments and showed higher risk behaviors such as hallucinogen use, they did not report high levels of overt psychological distress. Their gaming preferences leaned toward immersive, socially driven experiences, and they frequently used platforms like Steam and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dysregulated profile:&lt;/strong&gt; This group was made up of younger gamers who reported the highest levels of emotional distress and showed difficulties in all areas of emotional regulation. They had both attachment anxiety and avoidance, indicating significant interpersonal difficulties. They were more likely to use tobacco and energy drinks and showed signs of behavioral dysregulation, including risk to self or others. These gamers also spent more time gaming alone or with online friends and frequently used multiple social media platforms to engage with gaming communities. This group had the highest risk of developing gaming disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these profiles were significantly shaped by age, emotional regulation, mental health symptoms, and patterns of online and offline interaction. The dysregulated profile stood out for its combination of psychological vulnerabilities and intense engagement with online gaming and social platforms, which the researchers suggest may reflect a maladaptive coping strategy. In contrast, the avoidant and engaged profiles appeared to reflect more balanced and recreational use of gaming, with strong offline support networks and lower distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One important takeaway is that non-problematic gaming can be associated with individuals who maintain healthy emotional bonds and social relationships,” Castro and Neto told PsyPost. “In contrast, problematic gaming can emerge when individuals experience relational difficulties, whether through anxious attachment (fearing abandonment) or avoidant patterns (distancing from intimacy).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some, games may become the preferred médium of interaction, especially when face-to-face connections feel threatening or overwhelming. In these cases, the gaming environment may offer a sense of structure, predictability, and a sense of control, but it may also reinforce avoidance and deepen isolation. This highlights the need for supportive and nuanced approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the relational profile shared some risk factors with the dysregulated group, such as emotional difficulties and insecure attachment, it did not show the same level of psychological symptoms or substance use. The researchers interpret this group as selectively engaged with gaming in a way that offers social connection, possibly compensating for offline challenges without necessarily crossing into dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also surprised to find that in the avoidant profile, “players preferred to play alone (e.g., single-player games) yet showed secure attachment. It was also surprising the way that the dysregulated profile was associated with relational difficulties, particularly with both anxious and avoidant insecure attachment styles, as well as with some substance use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including its large and diverse sample and the use of well-validated psychological measures. However, the researchers caution that the findings are based on cross-sectional data, which limits their ability to draw conclusions about cause and effect. For example, it is unclear whether emotional dysregulation leads to problematic gaming, or whether excessive gaming worsens emotional difficulties. Longitudinal studies are needed to track how these profiles develop and change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the self-report nature of the study could introduce bias, as participants may underreport distress or overestimate their social engagement. Additionally, the study did not analyze specific gaming genres or content, which could influence motivations and psychological impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As with many psychological studies, our data are self-reported and based on a convenience sample, which can introduce bias and limit generalisability,” Castro and Neto noted. “Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of the data constrains causal interpretation. That said, although the size and diversity of the sample are considerable, we see this work as a first step in a broader line of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their long-term goal is to provide tools for clinicians and policymakers to recognize diverse gaming behaviors and offer tailored interventions. They also hope the findings can contribute to more inclusive strategies for promoting healthy gaming habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently finalizing a longitudinal study that follows these profiles over time, which will allow us to draw stronger inferences and examine how gaming behaviors evolve in relation to psychological variables,” Castro and Neto said. “Our long-term goal is to support clinicians with evidence-based tools that can inform assessment and intervention. This includes developing profile-based guidance for tailored approaches. We also hope that this work can be the beginning of studies that help shape policy and public health strategies, respecting the complexity of gaming behavior with inclusivity (e.g., by including non-binary individuals).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to thank all participants who contributed to this study, and to ISPA and APPSYCI Research Center. Working together has been a deeply enriching process, combining research and clinical thinking. Cátia, PhD candidate, who also works as a clinical psychologist, and David, PhD supervisor and experienced researcher, who also works as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist. We hope this study adds value to both the scientific community and the people it aims to support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPQkFPN2MyUXJxZkxXc2tBSXlEYVp2SWRacFJjZS1scVFUYmhuTzhEdTNBWllPYmwtblNUOXZFSHhkSHVObkphdTNRR1RUaDNBVUZTSTBfcGwzdFJkZDlaT3RlTDRwNi1CZnFsbVFjWS15ZzYwZzRROFZlTW05UEI1czl4OGNCX21BRHJiVVlLZ3BFMXV4b1VJRVpaeWRsRzlPUFplMXpuN1U5cG9ULWtMVVFqcE5JbFVIUjl1S2dKRnFzRmtu</guid></item><item><title>我尽一切努力来修复我的尿失禁。以下是行之有效的方法-《卫报》 | I tried everything to fix my incontinence.

Luckily, I was able to retrieve it before it entered the drain pipe, preventing the need for a mortifying 3am call to my super. This was both my first and last time using the Kegel ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eighteen years prior, I had experienced bladder leakage after giving birth, but it resolved within a year. Once perimenopause hit at age 47, however, the condition returned and managing it had become my part-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the advice of my gynecologist, I’d tried daily self-directed Kegel exercises, tampon-like devices designed to prevent leaks by lifting the urethra and bladder training – or gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits, which I lost interest in pretty quickly. None of these options really worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So my bladder kept leaking, usually after laughing, coughing or sneezing. Panty liners were now an essential part of my wardrobe. The worst leaks occurred when I went on a run, and required more substantial protection. I wondered how many other middle-aged women on my Central Park loop had diaper-like devices hidden under their Lululemon leggings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Perimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peace","elementId":"02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/27/perimenopause-life-changes"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Probably a lot. More than 60% of US women surveyed from 2015 to 2018 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35030139/#full-view-affiliation-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported bladder control challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Incontinence often begins after childbirth, due to a combination of estrogen loss and physical trauma, says Dr Meghan Markowski, board certified clinical specialist in women’s health physical therapy at Brigham and Women’s hospital. “Because we have a certain reserve of estrogen, things get better. Then, when we start to lose estrogen in peri- and post-menopause, these symptoms come back with full-fledged vengeance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was an empty nester, recent divorcee and dating again for the first time in decades when incontinence rereared its ugly head. On dates, I’d often scurry away in order to beat the leak. I wondered what these men thought of all those visits to the bathroom – perhaps they suspected I was sneaking drugs or plotting my escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although males are also likely to lose some bladder control with age, middle-aged men &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2010.05.025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;do not experience&lt;/a&gt; the same surge in incontinence that women do. The men I met were mostly my age and their kids had probably been potty trained a decade ago, or more. Did they really want a partner who was going through the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you can’t beat it, talk about it, I decided. And as I started to share, I noticed two things. First, men are usually OK with discussing your vaginal region, no matter the reason. And second, when I revealed my problem to female friends, I learned that I was in good company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no reason why this should be taboo,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/larissa-rodriguez-md/525-east-68th-street" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Larissa Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, urologist-in-chief and director of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/weillcornell.org/center-for-female-pelvic-health__;!!Aut6IJkzM0Y!pi8yYMfSggU_yQ29kriQoMu96GG0JbZ1OQgqOAzttFQmdGSj8n3VNaIzvEKEmPyrGDXPX0I3aROFiqoGygRlmdoVgrY$" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Center for Female Pelvic Health&lt;/a&gt; at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine. “For anything that affects women’s quality of life, they should seek care because there are ways to treat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-causes-incontinence-in-women" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes incontinence in women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are two main types of incontinence: stress and urge. Both occur because of a decline in estrogen, which weakens the pelvic floor and thins the lining of the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress incontinence is caused by physical pressure – such as coughing or running – putting stress on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is common when the pelvic muscles, which support the urethra, are weak. This is the type I had: unpleasant and inconvenient, but manageable with pads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence occurs when the bladder contracts more than it should, and can be much harder to live with. “It’s characterized by the sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is either difficult or impossible to defer,” said Markowski. “You could be out shopping, everything’s great, and you go to check out and all of a sudden … &lt;em&gt;Clear the path! I have to get there immediately!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-treat-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to treat incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For stress incontinence, the gold standard is sling surgery,” said Rodríguez. The sling is “material put under the urethra, like a hammock, so the urethra has something to close against when there’s an increase in abdominal pressure”. Traditionally, mesh is used but it’s also possible for doctors to harvest tissue from the patient, like the lining of the abdomen or the fascia of the thigh muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, stress incontinence can be relieved by injecting bulking agents to increase resistance and thickness in the urethral wall. “These are similar to the fillers people use for wrinkles,” said Rodríguez. “They are mostly water-based and close the urethra up a bit.” This is a good option for those who want to avoid surgery. It’s a shorter-term fix, but can last several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence can be improved with two types of medication, both of which reduce bladder contractions. The first type, anticholinergics, accomplish this by blocking the chemical messenger acetylcholine, while the second type, beta-3 agonists, relax the bladder’s detrusor muscle, thereby increasing bladder capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If medication fails, Rodríguez said nerve modulation – changing nerve activity via stimulation – is the next step. Inserting a pacemaker near the sacral nerves, which manage the bladder, can result in improved brain-to-bladder communication and control. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves at the ankle, blocking abnormal signals from the bladder and preventing spasms. Another option is injecting botulinum toxin, the same one people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/qa-why-are-more-people-using-botox-and-what-are-the-risks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;use for cosmetic purposes&lt;/a&gt;. It relaxes the bladder muscles so you don’t have spasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress and urge incontinence are both caused by midlife estrogen decline, so ongoing vaginal estrogen supplementation may help, like what’s prescribed for vaginal dryness at menopause, according to Dr Rajita Patil, assistant clinical professor of OB-GYN at UCLA and director of UCLA Health’s comprehensive menopause care program. “It takes a few months to see a difference, and the risks are really low,” said Patil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are the muscles so weak you can’t activate them? Or are they so tense you can’t activate them? The starting function of the pelvic floor muscles will determine the plan of care,” Markowski said. But a training program takes time; Markowski recommends at least three months. If this seems daunting, she suggests at least one pelvic physical therapy session to be properly evaluated and advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter which treatment you choose, behavior modification is also essential. “Alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages and artificial sweeteners irritate the bladder,” said Patil, who also encourages adequate hydration and maintaining a “healthy” body weight. “The more fat there is on the bladder and the urethral sphincter, the greater the pressure exerted on these structures, weakening their ability to maintain closure and increasing the likelihood of urinary leakage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another behavioral strategy is bladder retraining – gradually increasing the time intervals between bathroom visits, improving your ability to hold urine – which my gynecologist had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-sling-surgery-fixed-my-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How sling surgery fixed my incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A friend mentioned someone who had undergone a sling surgery, which I’d never heard of.

I scheduled the surgery, an outpatient procedure covered by insurance. Recovery was virtually painless; I didn’t even take any Tylenol. I stayed home for a few days, and was told not to exercise or “stick anything in the vagina” for four weeks. The hardest part was not being able to work out, but the anticipation of pad-less runs made it worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, two months post-surgery, my runs are pee-free. Last week, I visited my surgeon to reperform the bladder test. She made my bladder uncomfortably full via a catheter, then asked me to make a small cough. Then a medium cough. Then a loud one. My underpants remained as dry as a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to my surgeon, I should be “fixed” for at least the next 10 years. And physical therapy, though not mandatory, could make the results last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, there is no such thing as a perfect solution, and treatments may work best when combined with others. Markowski, who’s dedicated over 20 years to helping patients non-surgically, acknowledges that physical therapy might not be enough to resolve symptoms in all cases: “We always want to start with the most conservative measures and up the ante as time goes on, with meds or surgery. But surgery doesn’t change the muscle function, so in many cases, even the surgeon will want their patient to undergo physical therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rodríguez, a surgeon, concurs: “I am a strong believer in physical therapy, and pilates is also quite good in getting people to engage the pelvic floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best thing I ever did about my incontinence was start talking about it. Chances are, if you share, you’ll learn that you’re not alone. If you’re really lucky, you’ll even find someone to laugh with you about it. And if you pee a little when you do, you won’t be the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcUx6UlZ2cXRPeEFVYzV5WmVNRVo4UEdPRHZXX0NhOUp6ZjMyZ3hUR1VzTm1tY29JR19xdl9zMDZqSDRGZkVsZ1VzdHFFVlV4NkZTSlItSVRHZjRacVVhbXNsRjNOanp0QUxBeXNUbnZhNDc5M2pYYXpwLTB1QmdodE9pc2ttNE1EYi10b1h0eFhiNi1jZHQ2X0Y2UzM</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例： Mahopac餐厅的游客可能已暴露，官员警告- dailyvoice.com | Measles Case: Visitors To Mahopac Restaurant May Have Been Exposed, Officials Warn - dailyvoice.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNOVhLbkhqUWxsVUpGcTY1azg3aTBSeVJ4eXBzeG41TVZMdlZ5Umw3N25YOGRpT0tzVDlmVm9YMDNTOHdJeG9uY09HWHNSNDMyTF82YVBuaHhVd2pEMDBqNS0xU2xGWHBrdzZuY0xkTm9LT0QzMmlUU052YWZqUnFJb0dWVmlPVFk5bzIyLUZwcnlHUjFLWnNqaW9ha3BKanBUMVlwWHBDYmw2alNRd29KQ0FZNHFoZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="e-article-text" data-testid="article-detail-body" js-article-text data-read-smore-words="300"&gt;

        

        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual, who contracted the illness while traveling abroad, is no longer contagious, according to a Wednesday, June 4 announcement from the Putnam County Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-instream-video-container" js-instream-video-container=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials are urging anyone who visited Arturo’s Tavern at 878 Route 6 in Mahopac on Wednesday, May 28 between 6 and 10 p.m. to contact the health department immediately, as the infected person visited the establishment while still considered contagious. The number to call is 845-808-1390.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A communicable disease nurse will help determine any potential exposure and recommend what steps, if any, to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can spread through coughing and sneezing and, in rare cases, can be fatal. Health officials say the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours even after the infected person has left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-nativo-container" js-nativo=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department praised Arturo’s Tavern for fully cooperating with the investigation and helping identify any potential exposures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, sore throat, and later, a rash that spreads from the head down. Anyone who has been exposed and develops symptoms is urged to call their doctor or hospital before arriving so precautions can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said those born before 1957, those who have already had measles, or anyone who has received two doses of the MMR vaccine are generally protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leprosy is one of the oldest human diseases and originated in Eurasia or Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A new study has found a different species of leprosy-causing bacteria existed in the Americas before European settlement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists once believed Europeans brought leprosy to the American continents via infection from the bacterial species &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now a new study &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7144" title="External link — published in the journal Science"&gt;published in the journal Science&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reveals that a different form of leprosy-causing bacteria — called&lt;em&gt; Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; — was already circulating in the Americas for at least one thousand years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy was therefore already affecting American indigenous peoples well before European colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="63829704" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/63829704_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A microscope image of rod-shaped bacteria"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;For years, it was believed Mycobacterium leprae bacteria were the only cause of leprosy. That changed with the discovery of a new leprosy-causing Mycobacterium in 2008.&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: public domain&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; in America&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study authors analyzed more than 800 samples taken from ancient remains in &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/canada/t-39628562"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/argentina/t-19131805"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genomes of the bacteria taken from the samples were reconstructed, analyzed, and dated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons between the samples showed the bacterial genomes were of distinctive branches of the &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;species at each end of the continent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they remained genetically similar. This suggested that the bacteria species had spread rapidly across the Americas, probably covering the landmass in just a few hundred years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy is caused by two bacteria species, not one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leprosy is an ancient disease &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy has been infecting humans for thousands of years. The disease presents as multiple numbing skin lesions. If left untreated, it can result in nerve damage, muscle weakness, paralysis and blindness. Today, leprosy can be treated with &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/antibiotics/t-64386318"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, but ancient sufferers weren't so fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeletal records from 2,000BCE have been found in India with traces of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are matched by written records of leprosy cases in ancient literature from Indian, Chinese and African civilizations, as well as stories in the Abrahamic religions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, these ancient descriptions associated the affliction with stigmas of immorality or ritual uncleanliness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in 1874 the Norwegian doctor Gerhard Armauer Hansen discovered that leprosy was caused by the microscopic organism &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, doctors in Mexico found another leprosy-causing bacteria species — &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;— in a leprosy patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this, it was believed &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;was the only pathogen capable of causing the disease. Now both forms of the bacteria are known to cause it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="64488260" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/64488260_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A patient whose hand has been affected by leprosy."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Leprosy has been stigmatized around the world for thousands of years, but with quick medical treatment, its dangerous symptoms can be reduced&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Nyein Chan Naing/dpa/picture alliance &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Europeans spread diseases, leprosy too  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Rascovan, head of the Microbial Paleogenomics Unit at the Pasteur Institut in France led the investigation. He and his colleagues estimate &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;diverged from a common ancestor about one million years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The diversification happened probably independent of humans," Rascovan told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/syphilis-did-christopher-columbus-bring-the-std-to-europe/a-71096335"&gt;first European fleets to the Americas&lt;/a&gt; in 1492 marked the introduction of new diseases to the Americas. Leprosy — in the form of the &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;bacterium — was among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeological evidence has shown &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;migrated with human groups out of Africa and into Asia and Europe around 40,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its introduction to the Americas, along with other diseases, by Europeans devastated &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/dna-study-fills-gaps-in-indigenous-americans-ancestry/a-72558361"&gt;indigenous communities&lt;/a&gt; and intensified the impact of pathogens that were already circulating before colonization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;' longer history on the continent further highlights the diversity of pathogens and their complex relationship with humans throughout history, said Rascovan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europeans had a very important impact by bringing this new species [&lt;em&gt;leprae&lt;/em&gt;] that was absent in America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leprosy track and trace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rascovan hopes the presence of lepromatosis in the archeological record will improve understanding of pre-colonial disease, especially in the absence of written records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study helps understand modern cases of leprosy, especially how it could make the jump from animals like squirrels to humans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our work is giving the kick start to really start analyzing, monitoring and understanding the diversity of natural reservoirs [disease carriers]," said Rascovan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said monitoring the disease and preventing spillovers from animals to humans should be a priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is still prevalent today — 200,000 cases are reported each year globally. Brazil, India and Indonesia still report more than 10,000 new cases annually, according to WHO data.&lt;/p&gt;

After a good warm up, you can start with bodyweight exercises, like a chair or box squat, incline push-ups (see a demo from Tang &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CSXL6RYnayc" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CSXL6RYnayc" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="here" data-node-id="7.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and step-backs or supported lunges. Tang often recommends doing two to three sets of eight to 10 reps of each of these moves, twice per week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="focus-on-major-movement-patterns" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Focus on major movement patterns.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When bodyweight exercises start feeling easy, add a little weight and progress gradually, Tang says. You can also begin to mix in variations of exercises in each of the foundational movement patterns including the following (with links to examples): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="10" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUVFYDUDeyE/?igsh=aXZhNHJ2cmNmOG04" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUVFYDUDeyE/?igsh=aXZhNHJ2cmNmOG04" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Squat" data-node-id="10.0.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.0.0.0"&gt;Squat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., goblet squat, bodyweight squat)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CURaRPvjZMW/?igsh=MWtla2h1Nm5wMXA4dg%3D%3D" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CURaRPvjZMW/?igsh=MWtla2h1Nm5wMXA4dg%3D%3D" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lunge" data-node-id="10.1.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0.0"&gt;Lunge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or step variations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUd4XUJjJhT/?igsh=MXhhMjlzbjh3NXZiZg%3D%3D" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUd4XUJjJhT/?igsh=MXhhMjlzbjh3NXZiZg%3D%3D" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hinge" data-node-id="10.2.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.2.0.0"&gt;Hinge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., glute bridge, deadlift)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUX1T6lpwj2/?igsh=bzM5d3cwajIzZ283" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUX1T6lpwj2/?igsh=bzM5d3cwajIzZ283" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Push" data-node-id="10.3.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.3.0.0"&gt;Push&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., push-up, overhead press)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUbHvNrDbMf/?igsh=aTF5M3ZrazhwbXA0" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CUbHvNrDbMf/?igsh=aTF5M3ZrazhwbXA0" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pull" data-node-id="10.4.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.4.0.0"&gt;Pull&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., row, band pull-apart, lat pulldown)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="10.5"&gt;Core (e.g., plank, dead bug)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Tang’s client Olga Milne, 54, was hesitant to lift because of a back issue she’s had for 20 years, but after getting encouragement from her doctor (critical!), she started with very light weights and gradually increased as she felt comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Months later, “I had a good laugh when I saw my mom’s reaction as I picked up a 25-pound Easter turkey at the store,” says Milne. “I moved it with one hand without even thinking about it—and no one in my family had seen me carry more than three pounds in the last 20 years.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="leave-only-a-couple-reps-in-the-tank" data-node-id="13" class="css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Leave only a couple reps in the tank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Starting with lighter weights doesn’t mean to take it too easy. Even with body weight or lighter weights, make sure those last one to two reps are challenging you—that’s how you know you’re getting the most out of a workout. “If you’re making a face on those last two, it is challenging [enough],” says Tang. Do what works for you, and increase as you are able to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="mix-things-up" data-node-id="15" class="css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Mix things up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Tang says that an ideal week includes two days of lifting, five days of 30-minute brisk cardio (which could be &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a63934577/does-walking-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a63934577/does-walking-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;), and one to two days of mobility/stretching. In addition to her weekly workouts with Tang, Malini Wadhera, 57, likes long walks on her recovery days, and sometimes mixes in group fitness classes (like Barry’s or SoulCycle) which Tang encourages for variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training for several years has Wadhera feeling stronger (she can lift heavier weights) and more flexible. Other wins were unexpected: Recently, she surprised herself by getting up from a low stool without using her hands to assist, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="train-power-too" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Train power, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We lose power—the ability to move quickly—as we age, too, says Tang. Exercises like light jumps, bounds, or med ball tosses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473039/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473039/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="help maintain type II muscle fibers" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="19.1.0"&gt;help maintain type II muscle fibers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the ones that help us react quickly and powerfully, and potentially avoid a fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’ll definitely want to clear these moves with your doctor before you begin, especially if you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, but once you’ve done that, Tang suggests adding one or two power moves to your workouts after your warm up and before your main strength exercises. Check out some sample moves from Tang &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4gZdR9xFn1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4gZdR9xFn1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="here" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="recover-as-hard-as-you-work" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Recover as hard as you work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Always prioritize safety and allow for recovery between sessions,” says Dr. Kling. Walking is Tang’s go-to active recovery, and her clients love it, too. It’s a great way to keep blood flowing on those days off from the gym and helps to reduce soreness. Rest and eating right are crucial too: “Sleep and protein are non-negotiables for recovery and results,” says Tang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fuel-properly" data-node-id="23" class="css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Fuel properly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Speaking of proper nutrition, it’s essential not only to support recovery, but also to fuel your workouts in general. It’s especially crucial to consume enough protein as we age, says Tang, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="other experts agree" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;other experts agree&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="24.3" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Recommended Dietary Allowance" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) is about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, active people may want to aim for 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight. (Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.)&lt;br data-node-id="24.5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's also recommended to aim for a serving of veggies—the more colorful and varied the better—and a fist-sized portion of whole grains or minimally processed carbs per meal, especially around your workouts. Getting enough water is important, too, as staying hydrated supports joint health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In terms of supplements, Dr. Kling says &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g64783011/best-creatine-supplements-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/g64783011/best-creatine-supplements-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="creatine" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; may be considered as an adjunct to resistance training for improving muscle strength in women over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="recruit-help-if-you-need-or-want-it" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;Recruit help if you need (or want) it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Consider hiring a trainer, even short-term, to learn proper form and get into a groove with strength training. Joining a group class can also help with structure, consistency, and community to help you stay accountable.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/05/new-covid-19-variant-driving-up-cases-in-parts-of-the-world-who-says.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/05/new-covid-19-variant-driving-up-cases-in-parts-of-the-world-who-says.html"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; a “variant under monitoring” after the virus became the dominant strain in China, leading to a spike in hospitalizations this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OXVP52K7TJFLTPOUGQAZVBLU64"&gt;The CDC said health officials detected the variant in a handful of states beginning in March, including California, Hawaii, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington.

According to Time, the FDA’s vaccine committee met May 22 to discuss vaccine updates for fall that target LP.8.1, a variant that is related to NB.1.8.1 and the current vaccines’ target strain, JN.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4BKNYP5GD5HQDELKY4K7LO4XBM"&gt;Verman told CBS that early data also shows NB.1.8.1 also does not suggest severe illnesses compared to previous variants.

She is now a strong advocate for treatments for the disease and for spreading awareness of the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means more than to 44million more adults under 45 years old could be eligible for screening if this was adopted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), which sets colon cancer screening guidelines, has already lowered the recommended age for screening from 50 to 45 years in May 2021, saying this would have a 'moderate' benefit for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data shows about 34.5 percent of 45- to 49-year-olds got screened for colon cancer in 2022, a study found, up from 19.7 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US already has a lower colon cancer screening age than some other Western nations, including Canada — where it is set at 50 years — and England — which lowered the age from 60 to 50 years in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say people with symptoms of colon cancer or those who are concerned about the disease and are under 45 years old may still be able to get screened on their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insurance would consider screening tests for this group as diagnostic screenings&lt;span&gt; - a test to investigate specific symptoms - rather than a preventative screening - a test done on someone without symptoms to catch a disease early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out-of-pocket, a colonoscopy costs between $1,250 and $4,800 — although this varies significantly by state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael revealed he and his wife both first got screened for colon cancer at 35, despite having no family history of the disease. He recommended anyone who is concerned do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ontario-based physician, from the Sunnybrook Research Institute, added: 'Although I am from Canada, and the US has lower guidelines, I still think they should go further.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, he gave a talk on how colon cancer rates were surging in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paulus said: 'We have seen an "algorithm" be used already for non-small cell lung cancer screening to determine who should be screened when, based on risk factors. The same could be useful for colon cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Obesity could be one of the factors used to determine risk, but it would be better to take a multifactorial approach including other factors such as family history or ethnicity/race, although that can be controversial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, behind 85 out of every 100 cases diagnosed on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The USPSTF screening guidelines for lung cancer say adults aged 50 to 80 years get screened if they currently or within the last 15 years smoked 20 packs of cigarettes or more per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other doctors have also called for the screening age to be lowered, including Dr Aparna Parikh, a gastrointestinal cancer expert at Mass General Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She previously told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/07/should-colon-cancer-screening-start-at-40/"&gt;Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;: 'As an oncologist who sees largely young patients, my bias is to screen earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many of my patients are in their 20s and 30s. Expanding the screening eligible age may be a good space for stool- and blood-based screening and risk stratification to get the right people to colonoscopies efficiently.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer is generally screened for using a colonoscopy, where a flexible tube is inserted through the anus and into the colon. Patients are told not to eat any solid food for at least 24 hours beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alternatives include stool-based testing, where the fecal matter is examined for specs of blood or changes in shape, or blood-based screenings, where the blood is tested for specific changes in DNA that may indicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the conference, Paulus presented her team's study that found half of colon cancer patients diagnosed before age 50 years are under 45 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her team analyzed data on 104,281 colon cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2024, including 14,611 people who were diagnosed with the cancer before the age of 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also found that patients diagnosed with colon cancer before age 50 were more likely to be obese (36 percent of the group compared to 31 percent among older adults).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And more likely to live in urban areas, and be from a Black, American Indian or Hispanic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Michael Raphael called for the colon cancer screening age to be lowered, while Jessica Paulus suggested that people with risk factors for the disease may need to be screened earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded, 'In one of the largest cohorts of patients with EO-CRC [early-onset colorectal cancer] to date, this study confirmed that EO-CRC is an emerging concern within the US community oncology setting, particularly regarding heightened disparities in race, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pamela Kunz, the director of the Center for Gastrointestinal Cancers at Yale, Connecticut, told DailyMail.com in an interview that she did not believe the screening age for colon cancer should be lowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At present, the best data we have suggests that starting screening from age 45 years has the greatest benefit,' she said, 'while those with a family history of the disease should start ten years younger than the age of diagnosis'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There has not been great uptake of colon cancer screenings among people aged 55 to 45 years after the age was lowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so much we don't know too about why individuals develop the cancer - and whether it's genetic, environmental, diet or another factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;are surging &lt;/a&gt;among under-50s in the US in an uptick that has stunned researchers, with adults born in the 1980s having double the risk of suffering from the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among adults aged 25 to 29 years, colon cancer cancer rates have spiked 85 percent in two decades according to CDC data. AT the same time, over the last 30 years cases have dropped among over-50s by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Nutrient-packed foods can make a difference, and one fruit has been getting a lot of attention in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers investigating this fruit’s benefits is &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/mary-jane-de-souza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mary Jane De Souza&lt;/a&gt; from Penn State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work focuses on how it contributes to muscle mass and bone structure, especially in people over 45 who are facing the natural changes that come with menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscles-and-bones-need-extra-help"&gt;Muscles and bones need extra help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gradual loss of lean tissue can affect physical performance. Reduced bone density can also leave a person more prone to fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who want a balanced and enjoyable life after 45 often look for reliable dietary strategies that fit into a simple routine. Some studies have begun to explore how particular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; might fill that need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes contain a significant amount of nutrients, including vitamins and polyphenols. &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; are chemical compounds linked with antioxidant properties that may support healthy cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suggested that prunes might not only aid digestion but also help keep muscles and bones in decent shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-bones-and-muscles"&gt;Prunes help bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion around prunes often highlights fiber, but that’s not the only draw. Experts have pointed out that prunes carry components that are important for muscle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some references have also shown they can increase levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9526830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IGF-1&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in normal bone development and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a natural compound known as sorbitol, and certain acids that can influence blood sugar management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes appear to slow sugar absorption while helping the body handle glucose. Some studies connect these qualities to better energy balance throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-latest-research-found"&gt;What the latest research found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first randomized controlled trial to look at three-dimensional bone outcomes with respect to bone structure, geometry, and estimated strength,” said Dr. De Souza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; tested how prunes affect bone structure in postmenopausal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;. Their data suggests that a daily serving of prunes seems to slow typical bone changes seen in women after they stop having menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that investigation, people who ate at least four to six prunes per day saw noticeable stability in bone density measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that many participants who consumed prunes preserved bone quality over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-women-after-menopause"&gt;Prunes help women after menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women past 45, menopause means shifting hormone levels and a greater chance of bone mineral density loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38349471/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; revealed that routine prune intake kept certain bone markers stable in this group. One portion of research also highlighted how prunes help support cholesterol and antioxidant capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data has shown that prunes are tied to a better gut environment. Some participants appeared to experience fewer changes associated with inflammation when adding prunes into their diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that healthy gut microbes and reduced inflammatory markers might have an important link to bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that not everyone responds to prunes the same way. In one study, women with more diverse &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; were more likely to benefit from the fruit’s bone-supporting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-prunes-should-you-eat"&gt;How many prunes should you eat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts encourage daily consumption of around 50 grams of prunes, which equals five or six pieces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moderate serving size seems enough to deliver benefits without too many extra calories or sugars. People can easily add prunes to salads, cereals, or just enjoy them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many individuals in research studies were also advised to take in enough calcium and vitamin D. That suggests a broader approach to diet and daily habits is still essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, prunes have a particular identity as an easy snack that adds fiber, minerals, and certain vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants in the control group, who didn’t eat prunes, still improved their bone density. These women tended to have a higher &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; and more body fat overall, which may have played a role in protecting their bones through increased weight-bearing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, higher BMI can also lead to health issues like &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which were seen in these participants. The prune group, on the other hand, gained bone support without relying on excess weight or related metabolic risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-bones-and-muscle-health"&gt;Prunes, bones, and muscle health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prunes are no substitute for medication or a doctor’s advice, some researchers see real potential in this fruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasize getting a healthy mix of exercise, which might help maintain lean mass and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organic-molecules-collagen-discovered-in-66-million-year-old-dinosaur-bones/"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt; density as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued research points to a strong connection between natural compounds in prunes and measurable differences in skeletal support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More studies may clarify how prunes influence healthy gut bacteria or whether certain individuals benefit more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389638/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOZkh6c2FOVVMtbGJWWHNtaEVNVUxsZEZ5eWwwNXctVmtvU0huelJya0xjWGl6Tk4wTllyRmVUeENFRzRDb0VZSnJ3WEt0c1lTOVhFRGU5ZDZqdmVRcUlXUXl2bC1zN2tvVUZra0FVcWtrX0ROclg4elJ0emd0d0pHZEgxa2hZQVNsS1h1SHZGcEJmMkxpQy0yME0taDJhZkVPdDZxckFkVktvUQ</guid></item><item><title>根据新的研究，这种植物化合物可以降低您患心脏病和糖尿病的风险-财富 | This plant compound could lower your risk of heart disease and diabetes, according to new research - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE03Mk5FUVNsNVRtTG44MF9jQVA4ZEdoXzktbHMwbjExRlZYSnZpTjlNbTV3UXZJVGlQRmJWaVRXNzR0UzV0VjlwN1I1MHNWWkEzVUx6R2JYYS00OHA5djF6NjBiT3dkWDlGN25wS2hnSXl2aEpWWW85cC1vMTk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE03Mk5FUVNsNVRtTG44MF9jQVA4ZEdoXzktbHMwbjExRlZYSnZpTjlNbTV3UXZJVGlQRmJWaVRXNzR0UzV0VjlwN1I1MHNWWkEzVUx6R2JYYS00OHA5djF6NjBiT3dkWDlGN25wS2hnSXl2aEpWWW85cC1vMTk</guid></item><item><title>CDC官员监督机构对新冠肺炎疫苗的建议辞职- CNN | CDC official overseeing agency recommendations for Covid-19 vaccines resigns - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPNDBOWVFxZy1GRk5ERXNacEE1SVdCM3BQemhKNmJlUXNFQnBCLWhLYjd6NmE3OGtDeGhOSDBFVnQ0Y01lcGtkRmxUUERpbm5TOU96dEQ2WUxXRWk1ZWF6VGpGTzdJRnhtNXdhMWhTclBuMm9YQXFuRlZ6NnhOeUFiQtIBhgFBVV95cUxNWmJTUHljclA2NElBYkJzSE0xcnJjcGVRM21BVXFYVW1hZU82blRNR0UyeUs0LXhhcVJ2VnNINGFUZzd5WXJYcjN5aUdETnZRZEN4U0libWtFc0dyTTNZWTYzbTU4RU45T0pjTEdzT2loN3FOTU1Gc0lIc1Z4RVFKZFdGV09Edw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A medical officer at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was working on changes to the agency’s Covid-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Friday, the same day the US Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it had removed the CDC recommendations for pregnant women and healthy children to get Covid-19 vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhzo8mp00042e6bscntcp5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The officer, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatrician, was the CDC co-lead of the group of independent vaccine advisers that had spent months reviewing evidence for annual Covid-19 shots for Americans. They were drafting potential changes to narrow the agency’s recommendation for healthy children and adults under age 65, and had planned to vote on the changes at the group’s next meeting later this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhzo8mp00062e6bn0xcn3i9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am writing to let you know that on Friday of last week, I made the decision to end my time as co-lead of the Covid-19 work group, and after 12 years, I will be leaving the CDC,” Panagiotakopoulos wrote in an email to ACIP members that was obtained by CNN.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last week, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced on social media&lt;/a&gt; that his agency was removing the CDC recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhzt44p000a2e6b9d6mol1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision contradicts available medical evidence for pregnant women, who are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19 infections, and it usurped the authority of the CDC group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhzo8mp00072e6b2tcmbu52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy children can still get Covid-19 vaccines after consulting with a health care provider, a recommendation known as shared decision making. The CDC recommendation for people who are pregnant to get an updated Covid-19 vaccine has been removed from the schedule. The move may make Covid-19 vaccines harder to get and more expensive for those who want them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was overseeing the process to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resignation, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-expert-resigns-covid-vaccines-advisory-role-sources-say-2025-06-03/"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, comes just a week after health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unilaterally &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/"&gt;revoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role," Panagiotakopoulos wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unilateral changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC and ACIP recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up. Experts have emphasized that pregnant people in particular should get vaccinated, as pregnancy suppresses the immune system and puts pregnant people at high risk of severe COVID-19 and death. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that "COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic." Further, &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;dozens of studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccines are safe and effective at protecting the pregnant person, the pregnancy, and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unflavored, low-fat milk is one of the best dairy products to help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milk is free of added sugar and contains vitamins and minerals that are essential for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For optimal heart health, incorporate low-fat milk into a high-fiber diet that’s free of excessive sodium and added sugars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, the link between dietary and blood cholesterol levels isn’t as clear as once believed. In fact, some dairy products are incredibly beneficial for heart health—including unflavored, low-fat milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Research shows that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918189/healthiest-milks-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dairy products, like milk&lt;/a&gt;, can fit into a heart-healthy diet,” says &lt;a href="https://www.laurentwiggenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lauren Twigge MCN, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “While milk does contain some saturated fat, it also contains B-vitamins, potassium, calcium and magnesium which are known to support heart health.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we explain how consuming foods (and beverages) containing cholesterol might affect heart health and why low-fat milk is the #1 dairy product to enjoy if you’re trying to improve your cholesterol levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In recent years, researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/do-you-need-to-limit-dietary-cholesterol-11734823" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol in food&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t always have a negative impact on your blood cholesterol, as was previously thought.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “In fact, registered dietitians like myself now better understand that total saturated fat intake, not cholesterol, is actually the dietary component that has the largest impact on your cholesterol levels,” explains Twigge. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High saturated fat intake has been shown to increase &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL&lt;/a&gt; (“bad”) cholesterol levels, which can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pay attention to dietary cholesterol, as foods high in cholesterol tend to also be high in saturated fat (though this isn’t always the case). “While research has debunked the connection between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels, that doesn’t mean diet can’t play a role in managing your cholesterol levels,” adds Twigge.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good news for milk drinkers! Data suggests that regularly consuming low-fat dairy products, like milk, may protect against dying from heart disease, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s take a closer look at some of the benefits this go-to beverage has to offer.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apart from saturated fat, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt; is another key contributor to heart disease risk, as excess intake may increase LDL levels and reduce HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels. One study found that enjoying more than one, 12-ounce sugary drink (think: soft drinks and concentrated fruit juices) per day was associated with significant reductions in HDL and an increase in triglyceride levels—another risk factor for heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Milk is an incredibly versatile ingredient and pairs well with high fiber foods, making it easy and delicious to increase your fiber intake—which is another key way to lower cholesterol levels,” Twigge says. For example, you can make a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-ingredients-to-add-to-smoothie-8786900" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit smoothie or protein shake&lt;/a&gt; using low-fat milk and plant-based protein powder for a balanced, high-fiber snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many ways you include low-fat milk into your weekly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/23085/cooking-methods-styles/meal-prep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal prep&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use It As the Base of Your Smoothie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Skip the water and use dairy milk as a nutritious base,” Twigge says. “Blend milk with riced cauliflower, frozen kale, and frozen berries for a delicious way to add protein, calcium, vitamin D, and B vitamins to a colorful smoothie recipe.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir It Into Your Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporate milk into your breakfast, whether you’re making a bowl of oatmeal on the stove or prepping chia seed pudding the night before.“Mix milk with chia seeds, peanut butter and freshly sliced banana for a peanut butter banana chia seed pudding that’s high in fiber and protein,” Twigge says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend It Into Homemade Pasta Sauce: &lt;/strong&gt;Incorporating milk into your favorite pasta sauce recipes is a simple way to boost the nutritional stats of your sauce. “Milk adds protein, vitamins and minerals to any creamy pasta sauce that you want to make. Pour your pasta sauce over whole grain pasta and serve it with a side salad to boost your fiber intake,” recommends Twigge.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lower-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lower Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Achieving and maintaining healthy cholesterol levels requires more than just pouring yourself a glass of low-fat milk each day. Here are three other key dietary changes to help lower cholesterol levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Fiber Intake:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the best ways to lower your cholesterol levels is to follow a high-fiber diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; in particular is helpful as it absorbs cholesterol from your bloodstream and helps remove it from the body. Twigge recommends looking for foods with 1 gram of fiber for every 10 grams of total carbohydrates. If you prefer not to track your nutrition stats, prioritizing plant-based foods, like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, is a simple (yet effective) way to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;boost your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Back on Added Sugars:&lt;/strong&gt; While you can still enjoy sweet treats, try to cut back on added sugars in your diet. In addition to raising LDL cholesterol levels, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;excess added sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; can also increase your risk of other diseases, including obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Mindful of Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt; Sodium is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-electrolyte-supplement-11736890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;electrolyte balance&lt;/a&gt; and blood pressure regulation. However, Twigge cautions that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866099/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-too-much-salt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;high sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; can increase your risk for high blood pressure. Rather than immediately reaching for the salt shaker, try seasoning your foods with sodium-free alternatives, like lemon juice or herbs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, the good news is you can improve your levels by making changes to your diet. While you might worry that dairy products are off the table, research suggests that unflavored low-fat milk may actually be beneficial for supporting healthier cholesterol levels. Free of added sugar, it’s a nutritious alternative to sweetened beverages. Plus, it pairs well with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-weekly-to-lower-high-cholesterol-11703900" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other cholesterol-lowering foods&lt;/a&gt;, like oats, nuts and seeds. When in doubt, consider working with a registered dietitian to help you craft a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that works for your lifestyle and dietary needs.

But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Adding: "We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as a [single] soda or a candy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A doctor in New York City has discovered a worrying trend between sodas and the most aggressive form of cancer (Getty stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;What's more worrying, is that nationally, 63 percent of Americans aged 18 or older reported drinking sugar-sweetened beverages one or more times daily, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Schatoff's &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244792"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which she led alongside a team of colleagues, analyzed 303 early-onset colon cancer patients who conducted a questionnaire -

      &lt;p&gt;BISMARCK — After six new measles cases were reported in North Dakota over the weekend, three in Williams County in the state’s northwest corner and three in Grand Forks County, the state’s rate of confirmed cases now leads the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While national measles case data has been changing rapidly on a weekly and even daily basis since an outbreak began in Texas in late January, the rising outbreak in North Dakota has steadily caught up with that of New Mexico, the state which previously had the highest rate in the U.S. New Mexico and North Dakota were tied for the country’s highest rate of about 3.7 cases per 100,000 residents at the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;According to data from the North Dakota Public Health Association, on June 3, North Dakota’s rate stood alone at the top with 4.3 cases per 100,000 residents, while New Mexico’s rate stood at 3.7, with two new cases added over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the state’s rate is high, only 34 of the country’s 1,088 cases are in North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time North Dakota had the distinction of leading the country in an infectious disease outbreak rate was in the fall of 2020, when the state had the worst COVID-19 death rate in the country for 57 days straight, at one point even having the highest rate in the world for that metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, the state had its worst whooping cough outbreak since 2012, leading to the issuance of a health advisory. Also known as pertussis, the respiratory disease is considered “very contagious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen McDonough, a former longtime public health officer for North Dakota, said 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/with-lower-measles-vaccine-rates-some-north-dakota-counties-may-struggle-with-virus-experts-say" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;the state’s relatively low vaccination rates,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       thanks in part to misinformation, are to blame for the recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1990, North Dakota was deemed the healthiest state in the nation,” he said. “But now, in the last five years, the state has had three substantial infectious disease outbreaks. This is not an aberration. This is a pattern, and a horrible one. It is indicative of very serious public health problems in the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/immunizations/measles" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;according to the state’s measles tracking website,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       four North Dakota counties have reported measles cases, including seven cases in Cass County, 10 cases in Grand Forks County, one case in Burke County and 16 in Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Twenty-six of the state’s 34 reported cases are in children ages 5-19 years old. Four are in children age 4 or younger, and four are in people over the age of 20. Two people are hospitalized, and none of those infected were previously vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;Public health officials recommend that 95% of the population be vaccinated to prevent widespread infection. North Dakota’s rate is less than 90%, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services website says the measles vaccine is “very effective at protecting people against measles, mumps, and rubella. One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman said the department “continues to take the measles response seriously. We are actively conducting case investigations and contact tracing for every reported case.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS has facilitated laboratory testing, has supported access to the measles vaccine, provided a mobile medical unit, and continues to collaborate with and support local public health units,” she said, adding that the department encourages North Dakotans to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is recommended for anyone born in 1957 or later who is 12 months of age or older. Please speak with a trusted health care provider about getting vaccinated,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Hoeven expressed concerns about North Dakota’s measles outbreak and encouraged residents to follow the guidance of the state’s health department to help prevent the spread. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Asked for a statement about North Dakota’s nation-leading measles rate, a spokesman for Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the governor has been “consistent in strongly encouraging anyone concerned about measles to visit with their trusted health care provider.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Julie Fedorchak called the rise in cases “concerning” and said her office is monitoring measles cases in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious illness, and I encourage North Dakotans to consult with their doctors and follow medical guidance to keep themselves and their families healthy,” she said. “State and local health officials are best positioned to respond quickly and are doing a fantastic job — including setting up vaccination clinics that are being broadly used. Vaccines are a proven protection against this disease, but with all vaccinations I trust parents and individuals to make the decisions that are best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Health and Human Services

Kennedy Jr. said the measles vaccine hadn’t been “safety tested” and that the protection it provides wanes quickly, prompting alarm within the public health community,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       which has long attested to the safety of the vaccine and its lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

       after President Donald Trump signaled he would nominate Kennedy for the cabinet post last November, calling Kennedy’s ideas “outlandish and outrageous” and warning that the consequences for public health in North Dakota would be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Kennedy’s

       and 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-revives-misleading-claims-fetal-debris-measles-shots-2025-05-01/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;ongoing public doubts&lt;/a&gt;
    
       might be having any impact on the spread of measles in North Dakota, Sen. Kevin Cramer called any assertion correlating the two “absurd” and “unserious.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy advocates for what pretty much every normal adult in America and North Dakota believes: consult with your health care provider and understand your vaccine options to make informed choices based on your personal circumstances,” Cramer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, McDonough said Kennedy’s actions as secretary were playing out as he predicted, pointing to 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;funding cuts for critical research&lt;/a&gt;
    
       at Kennedy’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s decision to terminate or curtail over 40 research projects to counter vaccine hesitancy will assure that low vaccination rates continue into the future, and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks will continue,” McDonough said. “I doubt very much that North Dakotans want the federal government to hinder efforts to improve immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

"They also contain vitamin D, which helps with calcium absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhlstein added that sardines are "similarly rich in omega 3s and low in mercury and can be great overall for bone health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;One cup of raw kale is considered an "excellent source" of vitamin K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are among the best foods for overall health, as they're packed with various &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrients and vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrients and vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kale is a better option in the category, Klunk said, as it's naturally lower in oxalates, chemicals that can interfere with calcium absorption. Spinach, while high in calcium, also contains oxalates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of raw kale is considered an "excellent source" of vitamin K, according to EatingWell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drizzling or massaging kale with a healthy source of fat, like olive oil or avocado oil, will help ensure proper absorption of vitamin K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright also recommends other leafy greens like Bok choy and collard greens, noting their high calcium and vitamin K content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Beans and lentils offer magnesium, phosphorus and protein, which Wright said are important for "bone remodeling and strength."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds — like almonds, chia seeds or pumpkin seeds — provide bone-supporting elements like magnesium, phosphorus and small amounts of calcium, according to Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils also offer magnesium, phosphorus and protein, which the expert noted are important for "bone remodeling and strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini, which is made from ground sesame seeds, contains high amounts of calcium, magnesium and phosphorous, which are all essential for bone structure and density, Derocha shared &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:with EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;with EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium-rich foods like nuts help regulate the parathyroid hormone, according to Muhlstein, which helps control calcium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright stressed that calcium alone isn't enough to support bone health, as its proper absorption also requires vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't forget supporting nutrients like magnesium, vitamin K and protein," she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spread calcium intake throughout the day," Wright suggested. "The body absorbs calcium best in smaller doses (about 500 milligrams at a time), so space out sources, especially supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert also warns against "bone-harming" habits, such as consuming too much sodium, caffeine &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:or alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;or alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, or not getting enough fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/foods-should-eating-stronger-bones-according-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 foods you should be eating for stronger bones, according to nutritionists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;6 foods you should be eating for stronger bones, according to nutritionists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:32:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5hVkY4V3ljaVBGZ21GV3VPRjBvTE16alhPMUw4QkFUQmNjWHJBNkpjZmhhRHZTa0VWQmdCYWZ2dllQaHRGU2FabWNBb0hwekd6ZTRwNi1jUnp1NkprZzM0ZktoRDNBRlJLVDFxNk1XbnFEQQ</guid></item><item><title>废水现在正在帮助跟踪麻疹在美国各地的传播- CNN | Wastewater is now helping track measles spread around the US - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE4wMUowcVZxZjVLc2d3bjFDdVNZbGtBZG5BSmVYdnpNblNtVlo3VlFFV3NwQ2I4cGlUN1NkaXJDekRiYV9ZVEd2YjlySnZtMWh6ZkU4alVKR2Z6YXFjNjFMb1REdERJczlNbDRBRWJLVVdNdGZL0gF6QVVfeXFMT1BvSVgxNDFkRGlUSjB1T0FKZ0p5ak9Zcl9GM2xwNzNiYjROOTZ0NEFMb1NFd0lsZ1Zka2E3WGlqcW5CNkFWXzZCdW4ySUZfR2lJSlZmS2RZcmp3X3NQbFlPeE5XdkdyTUhMTnFTVjlxcVVhM3ljbVdZYWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            As measles cases rise to precipitously high levels in the US this year, there’s a new tool to help track the spread: wastewater.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhweerj000l3b6m6xjhcii4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wastewater surveillance rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, as testing sewage for virus particles helped provide early warning signs of increased transmission and fill the gaps as case reporting scaled back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwj8bv000o3b6moqjaayey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

It has the potential to identify possible cases days before an individual shows symptoms or seeks care. The new tool is available for use in nearly 150 wastewater treatment facilities across 40 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwawoi004d28p811qgc727@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 1,157 measles cases have been reported in the US this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200023b6mqvyey1li@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large multistate outbreak centered in West Texas accounts for the vast majority. Texas has reported 742 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 81 cases, and Oklahoma reported 18 cases – 15 confirmed and three probable – as of Tuesday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may also be linked to the outbreak, have reached 71 as of Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200033b6mgukaxrbm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported. However, the nation is now fewer than 120 cases away from the total reported for all of 2019, the year with the highest number of measles cases – 1,274 - since the disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200043b6mpfc9zw0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Dakota reported its first measles case of the year Monday, bringing the total number of states that have reported at least one case in 2025 up to 33.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300053b6mi2dgqupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new case in South Dakota is in an adult who travelled internationally, according to a news release from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300063b6mifju2ldh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its measles guidance for travelers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300073b6mdyefy3ib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” a CDC &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; says. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune. CDC recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to any international destination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300083b6m63saybhz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other recent examples include a case in Minnesota that was reported in an adult who was exposed during domestic air travel, and the New Jersey health department has warned of potential measles exposure in the Newark airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300093b6mwwj4n49w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 14 outbreaks in the US this year, according to the CDC, accounting for 90% of cases. The CDC’s data is limited to confirmed cases and lags behind CNN’s tally for this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000a3b6mzdmmtvan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 5% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000b3b6m82era98s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses as the best protection against the disease, with the first dose given at 12 to 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000c3b6mli7093zg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Childhood vaccination rates have been declining across the US for years, with MMR vaccination coverage among &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement"&gt;kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; falling below the recommended 95% threshold for at least four years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000d3b6mo9z9uidb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2834892" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from Johns Hopkins University, published Monday in the journal JAMA, emphasizes how widespread the decline has been. MMR vaccination rates among children have dropped in more than three-quarters of US counties, with an average drop of 2.7% between 2017 and 2024, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000e3b6m3cnuiu74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination rates have surged in some places that are experiencing measles outbreaks, however. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according to data from the state health department. And a recent &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000f3b6mzkuxrlol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 133 people with measles have been hospitalized this year, according to the CDC, and there have been three deaths: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength and balance naturally decline as we age, but that doesn’t mean we’re powerless to prevent it. While aging is inevitable, staying strong doesn’t require a pricey gym membership. With the right habits, even simple daily movements can help preserve mobility and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is well known for its health benefits at any age, from boosting cardiovascular fitness to strengthening bones. At Tom’s Guide, we’ve tested everything from Japanese walking techniques to rucking and the 5-4-5 method to get more out of our steps, using the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to monitor progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s one everyday activity that deserves more attention for its strength-building potential, and that's stair climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, stair climbing can build muscle power, improve balance, and offer similar benefits to traditional gym workouts for older adults. It is a low-cost and accessible way to stay strong, steady, and independent, with benefits that go far beyond just getting from one floor to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-does-the-research-say"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does the research say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39590559/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39590559/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, researchers compared stair climbing with traditional resistance training in adults over 70. Both groups improved in lower-body strength and everyday tasks like walking and standing up from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who climbed stairs performed better in stair-climbing tests, which may not come as a surprise, but reinforces the idea that simple, familiar movements can be just as effective as a gym session. For anyone looking to stay strong without lifting weights, this is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-stair-climbing-works"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why stair climbing works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbing stairs works your glutes, quads, and calves, and also challenges your balance with every step. It’s a simple way to build strength and stability at the same time. It also gets your heart pumping, so even a few minutes can count as a quick cardio session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DYq4ipryXA4nKXJUnDrSLM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DYq4ipryXA4nKXJUnDrSLM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, short bursts of vigorous activity like stair climbing can significantly improve heart health. In women, researchers found that climbing stairs for just four to five minutes a day was linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and a healthier, longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-incorporate-stair-climbing-into-your-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to incorporate stair climbing into your routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not ready to take on multiple flights? Start with a short stair circuit. Climb up and down a few steps for a few minutes at a steady pace to get your heart rate up and engage your lower body muscles. Use a handrail for support if needed, wear stable, supportive shoes, and focus on strong, controlled movements. Even a five-minute stair session can feel surprisingly effective and help build strength and stamina over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already active and want more of a challenge, try increasing your pace, adding more flights, or using a stair climber machine at the gym to build endurance and intensity. Whatever your starting point, stair climbing is easy to scale up or down. Just remember to check in with your doctor if you have any health concerns before beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for more simple ways to move, try boosting your metabolism with this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;5,000-step walking workout&lt;/a&gt;, adding extra steps with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;the habit stacking trick&lt;/a&gt;, or mixing things up with the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;6-6-6 walking challenge&lt;/a&gt; for a more structured routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Fitbit Charge 6,fitbit inspire 3,Amazfit Band 7,forerunner 265,Amazfit Active,Garmin Venu 3,Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,Whoop 4.0,Apple Watch Series 10,Oura Ring 4" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-items-container" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Tue, Jun 17, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Tue, Jun 17, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

Using mice aged 2 to 23 months, scientists found that older mice experienced 4–6 times more BBB breakdown than younger mice under similar hypoxic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed increased brain inflammation in older mice, regardless of oxygen level. These findings may explain why elderly individuals with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular issues are at greater risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heightened Vulnerability:&lt;/strong&gt; Aged mice showed significantly more BBB disruption at higher oxygen levels than younger mice, indicating increased sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglial activation, a marker of brain inflammation, was elevated in older mice even under normal oxygen conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repair Deficit:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite steady blood vessel growth across ages, older brains exhibited impaired BBB repair, suggesting weakened vascular resilience with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new study, researchers Arjun Sapkota, Sebok K. Halder, and Richard Milner from San Diego Biomedical Research Institute investigated how aging affects the brain’s vulnerability to low oxygen, or hypoxia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using C57BL/6J mice ranging from 2 to 23 months of age, they identified specific oxygen levels that disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB)—a critical structure that protects brain tissue from harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110645"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. In this study, mild and prolonged hypoxia—called chronic mild hypoxia—was found to compromise the BBB in mice. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are important for understanding age-related cognitive decline and the potential risks faced by individuals with chronic oxygen-limiting conditions such as asthma, sleep apnea, emphysema, and heart disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. In this study, mild and prolonged hypoxia—called chronic mild hypoxia—was found to compromise the BBB in mice. Older mice showed significantly more BBB disruption than younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, barrier weakening and blood vessel changes occurred at oxygen levels of just 15% in aged mice, compared to 13% in young mice. These data suggest that the aging brain is more sensitive to oxygen deprivation, even at levels that may be considered only mildly hypoxic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also determined when this vulnerability emerged. The BBB showed increased sensitivity to low oxygen not only in aged mice but also in mice as young as 2 to 6 months, with a second spike occurring between 12 and 15 months—equivalent to middle age in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may reflect age-dependent changes in brain vascular function and remodeling capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key focus was microglial activation, a sign of brain inflammation. Aged mice exhibited higher microglial activation across all oxygen levels, including normal conditions. Chronic microglial activation is closely linked to neuroinflammation and has been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the rate of blood vessel formation was constant across ages, the degree of BBB disruption increased sharply with age, suggesting that repair mechanisms may weaken over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These results may help explain why older adults with chronic hypoxia-related diseases are at higher risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The study also draws attention to the risks of high-altitude exposure for aging populations, where oxygen levels naturally drop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Altogether, these findings underscore the importance of protecting brain health in older individuals by managing oxygen exposure and reducing hypoxia-related risks. The researchers emphasize the need to develop new therapies that support blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly in aging populations exposed to chronic or intermittent low-oxygen conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and hypoxia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f323a3b363e1f36322f3e3c2b35302a2d313e332c713c3032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.18632/aging.206241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Defining the hypoxic thresholds that trigger blood-brain barrier disruption: the effect of age&lt;/a&gt;” by Arjun Sapkota et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the hypoxic thresholds that trigger blood-brain barrier disruption: the effect of age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic mild hypoxia (CMH; 8% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) triggers transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, an effect greatly increased with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BBB disruption predisposes to neuronal death and cognitive decline, here we defined the hypoxic thresholds that trigger BBB breakdown in young and aged mice, and then defined the age at which hypoxia-induced BBB disruption significantly increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual-immunofluorescence of brain sections demonstrated that the thresholds required to trigger hypoxia-induced BBB disruption (CD31/fibrinogen) and endothelial proliferation (CD31/Ki67) were much lower in aged mice (15% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to young (13% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the BBB became more vulnerable to hypoxic disruption at 12–15 months, a large step-up also occurred at the surprisingly young age 2–6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrates that the aged BBB is far more sensitive to hypoxia-induced BBB disruption than the young and define the hypoxic thresholds that trigger hypoxia-induced BBB disruption in young and aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information has translational implications for people exposed to hypoxia and for those living with hypoxia-associated conditions such as asthma, emphysema, ischemic heart disease, and apnea.&lt;/p&gt;

and is encouraging international travelers to get vaccinated (or confirm their vaccination status) against the measles virus before heading abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Measles is an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected,” the CDC advisory reads. “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to the ongoing risk, the CDC advises all travelers going to or from an international destination to be fully vaccinated against measles. For travelers who are not yet vaccinated or unable to get vaccinated, the government agency encourages people to consult a medical professional and consider postponing their trip until the risk is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory was last reviewed on May 28 by the CDC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denver International Airport is one site that health authorities have closely monitored as a source of several recent measles cases. At least four passengers on a recent Turkish Airlines flight reportedly caught measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Public health officials are notifying members of the public of additional areas for potential measles exposures, as a result of these confirmed cases,” the Colorado advisory states. “The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-six percent of the cases have been unvaccinated or whose status was unknown, and only 12 percent of cases have required hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-measles-travel-warning-spread-in-airplane/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC spokesperson said there have been 62 cases of measles that tie back to international travel thus far in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing, and can remain in the air for up to two hours, the CDC advisory states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/cdc-international-travel-advisory-measles-vaccination-11747257" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Travel &amp;amp; Leisure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Travel &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBySXlESDkwWU9SUkRWRFZQY0xxZ29fSF84TGJDTFhoRURnSUh1ZURXdW9aMHpucWFMQkFmUmd2Njc4aXBrZkpyZUF4S2hwY0VScVFwVzA3ZWtwcC1OMi1CSmFsbHN4QXhGdGlKXzBzdjlSWk5HSFE</guid></item><item><title>失乐园：患者被告知离开医院避风港-旧金山标准 | Paradise lost: Patients told to leave hospital haven - The San Francisco Standard</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOS2dxNzlFQlJXSWw1U0ZBZ2h0OHJjMHVLRzlhM1N1QjR6NXNHZ1BINHVrNHFmQlo0MG5MT2JPeDNTcUo4RUxKME5QV1I3Z3VRdTBkcmtnM0FkVGFYbThSSHgyTDBqUlJ6cEFDZVBhN2pGdm9qcEFxQzRmT1Z2RFZJdFMwY0JvQTZBT1MwSUxUMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela, who has schizophrenia and a history of violence, also spent time on the streets and in jail.

The study’s authors found that plunging your limbs into icy water after lifting weights slows blood flow to muscles, hampering their ability to recover and grow, potentially reducing the benefits of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAJUHVAIN5GXLN37ROMWYQJKGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It looks like it’s not a great idea” to soak in freezing water after lifting weights, said Milan Betz, a doctoral student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VEUD4SUYT5C3NMDLMOU2EG5VCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings add to mounting evidence that ice baths may undermine the effects of lifting and also raise the provocative issue of when, if ever, ice baths are a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Muscles that are 20 percent smaller&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6675K6JXONF4XNFBVTFASXJC3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fans of cold plunging typically say the practice is beneficial for both body and mind, lifting moods, building grit, soothing aches and stiffness, and, perhaps above all, speeding up and intensifying recovery from exercise, so you get more from each workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQSPKRIEONAD3JV7ZDNHXDXXUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But little science has supported the purported benefits of ice baths, and in recent years, studies have frequently undercut them. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174323/" target="_blank"&gt;2015 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, scientists in Australia asked 21 men to lift weights twice a week. Half of the men cold plunged after every session; the others didn’t. After three months, the cold plungers’ muscles were nearly 20 percent smaller and weaker than the other men’s, although everyone followed the same exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZHU57IHZ5GEDP56W36V5OWBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsc.12074" target="_blank"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; of prior research, cheekily titled “Throwing Cold Water on Muscle Growth,” concluded that the best available research indicated cold plunges after resistance training can “attenuate hypertrophic changes.” In other words, your muscles won’t grow as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens to blood flow after a cold plunge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4M2QYTIMC5FABHWS2PVWLHUQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How would cold water undo resistance exercise? The review’s authors speculated that frigid temperatures shrink blood vessels, impeding blood flow to muscles. Blood carries nutrients, including protein, that muscles rely on to rebuild and bulk up after draining exercise. Less blood flow means less protein and a feebler recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XBE5CRTA5AHFOTIEQFQBSUGDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But no study had yet shown that process in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FH25FO64CBH5PM3VB2LIX6HMZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Enter Betz and his colleagues. They wanted to see what happens to blood flow after ice baths, so they recruited 12 healthy young men and used portable ultrasound machines to track baseline blood flow in their legs as they rested at the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LC4YHNYITBGXVH4TIRUPFDJBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The volunteers then sweated though a tough session of leg press and leg extension exercises, before immediately clambering onto a bicycle-like contraption with large buckets where the pedals should be. One contained tepid 80-degree water, the other icy 30-degree water. The men slid a leg into each bucket, so one limb cold plunged, the other didn’t, and stayed there for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5I5ZUCQRAU7MHSCN5MSPESKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Afterward, the volunteers drank a recovery shake containing protein molecules marked with a biochemical tracer. Researchers could track the tracer to see whether the proteins wound up in muscles or not. The scientists also checked blood flow with an ultrasound several more times over the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cold plunges may undo benefits of weight training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W54OQLHMSVDPRBAT5ZROEE5PQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that blood flow dropped substantially in the volunteers’ cold-plunged leg, compared to their other limb, and stayed low for hours. The muscles in that chilled leg consequently received and absorbed far less protein from the shake. Over time, this reduced protein intake would likely mean blunted gains in strength and muscle mass from the lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDGYNPPXQVACVMNU6OFTHF72O4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The results “provide confirmatory evidence” that cold plunges can alter the desired effects of weight training by reducing blood flow and protein uptake, said Brad Schoenfeld, an exercise scientist at Lehman College in New York, who studies resistance training and co-wrote the 2024 review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWTLBP6TGVDJXMONGHDIKQX23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But this was a single, small study, and many questions remain unanswered. Would ice bathing likewise affect recovery from other exercise? “I would think you’d see similar effects with other sports” such as running, cycling and team sports, Betz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HWIVTTIIGVGJ3CNKBDH5EC2XCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about the effects on women and older people, who weren’t studied here? Betz said he believes, again, the impacts would be much the same in almost everyone, but those studies need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUTSNPKQZJHW3EMRKCQE527ZOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also unclear whether and to what extent timing and other details matter, said Denis Blondin, a professor of health sciences who studies metabolism and cold exposure at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada. He wasn’t involved with the new study. Maybe ice baths several hours after a workout would have different effects on muscles, he said, as might tweaking how long you soak, how much of your body is submerged and the water’s exact temperature. More large-scale research is needed to understand the nuances of cold soaks and exercise response, Blondin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IOOP36Y4YVDXROSJN3CX4XZOMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people also ice bathe for reasons unrelated to exercise recovery, including to make themselves feel mentally stronger and more resilient. The new study did not consider psychological outcomes from chilling out, Betz said, and, if you find comfort in cold plunges, “there’s no reason to change your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXJIJFRIPNGSDPL5WZODKVX53M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But, to get the most gains from weight training, he said, the bulk of the available evidence, including the new study, suggest you should probably skip an ice bath soon afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most complex cognitive functions are possible because &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/pen.2020.6"&gt;different sides of your brain&lt;/a&gt; control them. Chief among them is &lt;a href="https://nmoer.pressbooks.pub/cognitivepsychology/chapter/lack-of-invariance/"&gt;speech perception&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to interpret language. In people, the speech perception process is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/331585a0"&gt;dominated by the left hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brain breaks apart fleeting streams of acoustic information into &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00351-1"&gt;parallel channels&lt;/a&gt; – linguistic, emotional and musical – and acts as a biological multicore processor. Although scientists have recognized this division of cognitive labor &lt;a href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2301213/component/file_2452907/content"&gt;for over 160 years&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanisms underpinning it remain poorly understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers know that distinct subgroups of neurons &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz3468"&gt;must be tuned&lt;/a&gt; to different frequencies and timing of sound. In recent decades, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/325249a0"&gt;studies on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14402"&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10690-3"&gt;especially in rodents&lt;/a&gt;, have confirmed that splitting sound processing across the brain is not uniquely human, opening the door to more closely dissecting how this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a central puzzle persists: What makes near-identical regions in opposite hemispheres of the brain process different types of information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering that question promises broader insight into how experience sculpts neural circuits during critical periods of early development, and why that process is disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timing is everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing of sounds begins in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/"&gt;the cochlea&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the inner ear where sound frequencies are converted into electricity and forwarded to the auditory cortex of the brain. Researchers believe that the division of labor across brain hemispheres required to recognize sound patterns begins in this region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, &lt;a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/hysell-oviedo-phd/"&gt;my work as a neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the auditory cortex. &lt;a href="https://oviedolab.org/"&gt;My lab&lt;/a&gt; has shown that mice process sound differently in the left and right hemispheres of their brains, and we have worked to tease apart the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10690-3"&gt;underlying circuitry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve found the left side of the brain has more focused, specialized connections that may help detect key features of speech, such as distinguishing one word from another. Meanwhile, the right side is more broadly connected, suited for processing melodies and the intonation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Auditory_Pathway.png"&gt;Jonathan E. Peelle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tackled the question of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;how these left-right differences in hearing develop&lt;/a&gt; in our latest work, and our results underscore the adage that timing is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tracked how neural circuits in the left and right auditory cortex develop from early life to adulthood. To do this, we recorded electrical signals in mouse brains to observe how the auditory cortex matures and to see how sound experiences shape its structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we found that the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;right hemisphere consistently outpaced the left&lt;/a&gt; in development, showing more rapid growth and refinement. This suggests there are critical windows of development – brief periods when the brain is especially adaptive and sensitive to environmental sound – specific to each hemisphere that occur at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the consequences of this asynchrony, we exposed young mice to specific tones during these sensitive periods. In adulthood, we found that where sound is processed in their brains was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;permanently skewed&lt;/a&gt;. Animals that heard tones during the right hemisphere’s earlier critical window had an overrepresentation of those frequencies mapped in the right auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding yet another layer of complexity, we found that these critical windows &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;vary by sex&lt;/a&gt;. The right hemisphere critical window opens earlier in female mice, and the left hemisphere window opens just days later. In contrast, male mice had a very sensitive right hemisphere critical window, but no detectable window on the left. This points to the elusive role sex may play in brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide a new way to understand how different hemispheres of the brain process sound and why this might vary for different people. They also provide evidence that parallel areas of the brain are not interchangeable: the brain can encode the same sound in radically different ways, depending on when it occurs and which hemisphere is primed to receive it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Speech and neurodevelopment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division of labor between brain hemispheres is a hallmark of many human cognitive functions, especially language. This is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced language information encoding in the left hemisphere is a strong indication of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4575-09.2010"&gt;auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. And a shift from left- to right-hemisphere language processing is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.382"&gt;characteristic of autism&lt;/a&gt;, where language development is often impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/671673/original/file-20250602-56-2kqkyn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Children with certain neurodevelopmental conditions may have trouble processing speech.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/child-girl-having-ear-pain-touching-his-painful-ear-royalty-free-image/1398019642"&gt;Towfiqu Ahamed/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the right hemisphere of people with autism seems to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05696-8"&gt;respond earlier to sound&lt;/a&gt; than the left hemisphere, echoing the accelerated right-side maturation we saw in our study on mice. Our findings suggest that this early dominance of the right hemisphere in encoding sound information might amplify its control of auditory processing, deepening the imbalance between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These insights deepen our understanding of how language-related areas in the brain typically develop and can help scientists design earlier and more targeted treatments to support early speech, especially for children with neurodevelopmental language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

That’s how it’s supposed to work in theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But slaughterhouses operate at a rapid, hectic pace, with animals sometimes stunned improperly and butchered while still alive and conscious. If a cow remained conscious once they got to Tom — as was the case with this cow in particular, whose calf was partially hanging out of her birth canal — he was unable to stop the line to ensure they were properly killed. So, as the cow kicked at him, mid-birth, he had no choice but to skin her alive. The calf didn’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It takes 25 seconds&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;“ to skin them, he said in&lt;em&gt; The Dying Trade&lt;/em&gt;, “but it stays with you for the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tom, who calls himself a “devout animal lover,” said that it’s “very difficult watching animals being killed.” But the job desensitizes you: “You become a robot.” Other slaughterhouse workers have made &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;similar remarks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Ducks hang upside down from a processing line as workers hang more animals on the line at a duck farm’s on-site slaughterhouse in Portugal that also slaughters animals from nearby farms.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Human Cruelties/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To cope, Tom spent most of his slaughterhouse career as a functioning alcoholic, drinking as soon as he got off work until he went to bed. He took magic mushrooms on weekends to escape. He also dissociated at work, spending much of his time on the production line “thinking I was on holiday…I would dream I was in Spain somewhere — just anywhere but what I was doing.” Now, he said, he lives like a hermit and still dreams about slaughterhouses six to seven nights a week. He also has violent thoughts of hurting people, which he had never had prior to working in meat processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I suffer with PITS as a result,” Tom said, referring to &lt;a href="https://perpetrationtrauma.org/"&gt;perpetration-induced traumatic stress&lt;/a&gt;, a subcategory of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in which the cause of the trauma is being a perpetrator of violence — in this case, slaughtering animals for food — rather than being a victim of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect/405972/trump-slaughter-line-speed-poultry-pork"&gt;Physical injury rates are high in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the more dangerous occupations. But much less is known about the mental and emotional toll of slaughterhouse work. Psychology researchers have difficulty accessing slaughterhouse worker populations, and so we’re left with a handful of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;small studies&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, it’s unknown exactly what share of the world’s millions of slaughterhouse workers suffer from PTSD or other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But what’s certain is that many do — surveys of slaughterhouse workers show high rates of anxiety and depression, and &lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/31/how-killing-animals-everyday-leaves-slaughterhouse-workers-traumatised-7175087/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; stories of &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/"&gt;mental health struggles&lt;/a&gt; with researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50986683"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is likely to worsen in the years ahead, as more and more slaughterhouses are built around the world to &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/07/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2023-2032_859ba0c2.html"&gt;satisfy increasing meat consumption&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two years ago, the American Medical Association’s Journal of Ethics even devoted an &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/issue/meat-and-health"&gt;entire issue&lt;/a&gt; to the meat industry’s effects on societal health, including its impact on workers. &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-should-clinicians-respond-patients-experiencing-ongoing-present-traumatic-stress-industrial-meat/2023-04"&gt;One article&lt;/a&gt; by social psychologist &lt;a href="https://rachelmacnair.com/"&gt;Rachel MacNair&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term PITS, put the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work — and society’s complicity in the problem — in blunt terms: “Public demand for meat creates ongoing, present, and future exposure to trauma and continual retraumatization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-we-know-about-the-psychological-toll-of-slaughterhouse-work" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The concept of PTSD stems from studies of combat veterans, research that accelerated in the post-Vietnam War era in the US. It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental health condition in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it took time for psychologists to recognize that being the one who perpetrates violence — as opposed to experiencing or witnessing it — can also be highly traumatic, or even more so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a 1998 study, MacNair told me, she observed that Vietnam War veterans who directly killed people had higher trauma scores than those who only witnessed killing. In 2002, she published the first book on the issue — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/perpetrationinduced-traumatic-stress-9780313012501/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which went beyond war and into other arenas of violence, including policing, death penalty executions, torture, homicide, and slaughterhouse work. The idea has since expanded how psychologists think about traumatization from violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Slaughterhouse work can also deeply impact those who don’t directly kill animals but still play a critical role in meat production, like David Magna, a former slaughterhouse inspector for the Canadian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For six years, Magna worked at a major chicken plant, where one of his jobs entailed standing behind employees on the slaughter line — which operated at the breakneck speed of 180 birds per minute — to check for signs of disease and other issues. He also inspected crates of chickens as they were unloaded to be slaughtered; sometimes, hundreds would arrive dead from &lt;a href="/future-perfect/414338/chick-usps-animal-transport-meat"&gt;exposure to extreme heat or cold&lt;/a&gt; during transportation from the factory farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After six years at the chicken slaughterhouse, Magna developed severe respiratory problems, requiring him to take time off (it’s not uncommon for poultry workers to complain about the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-chicken-plants-chemicals-blamed-for-health-ailments-are-poised-to-proliferate/2013/04/25/d2a65ec8-97b1-11e2-97cd-3d8c1afe4f0f_story.html"&gt;toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals used in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the next decade, Magna went on to work as an inspector at other plants along with a desk job in which he reviewed animal welfare violation reports, including a number of disturbing cases. In one, a farmer branded some of his pigs a dozen or so times each with a hot iron all over their bodies, but was only penalized with a fine and was allowed to continue to raise animals for meat. In another case, a truckload of pigs froze to death after a driver fell asleep. One report involved a pregnant dairy cow who gave birth on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. Because the trailer was so crowded, the calf’s head was smashed in by other cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Pigs lie dying on a bloody slaughterhouse floor in Canada as a worker stands over them before pushing them into a scalding tank.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I’m a shell of what I was when I walked in that [first] day,” Magna told me. Throughout his career, he’d try to improve conditions, but the deck was stacked against him: regulations are weak, violators face little to no penalties, and higher-ups often didn’t take his concerns seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like Tom, the slaughterhouse worker in Europe, Magna drank excessively to cope. He also had dreams in which he was a chicken packed in a crate and then slaughtered. His mother, who had briefly worked on the slaughter line, had similar dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Objects like a plate of meat or a truck can trigger flashbacks for Magna. He’s dealt with suicidal ideation, and a few years ago, he was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gathering broader data on the experiences of people who work in slaughterhouses has proven difficult, but there is some. A few years ago, a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt; by psychologists Jessica Slade and Emma Alleyne at the University of Kent found slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of anxiety and depression, and a higher propensity for physical aggression. A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/qhw.v11.30266#d1e614"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; of slaughterhouse workers in South Africa found that each had recurring nightmares, like Tom and David, and &lt;a href="https://awakenwfu.com/2023/04/21/the-human-cost-of-animal-slaughter/"&gt;some workers&lt;/a&gt; have reported &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228141419_A_Slaughterhouse_Nightmare_Psychological_Harm_Suffered_by_Slaughterhouse_Employees_and_the_Possibility_of_Redress_through_Legal_Reform"&gt;high rates of alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s been no large-scale study investigating PTSD rates among slaughterhouse workers, and there’s a good reason why: It would be hard to conduct such a study without cooperation from meat companies. And many slaughterhouse workers are undocumented immigrants who might be reluctant to share their stories, even if they were anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-system-oppresses-everyone" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This system oppresses everyone” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people who live near factory farms, which produce &lt;a href="/future-perfect/395967/iowa-factory-farm-pollution-sacrifice-state"&gt;vast amounts of animal manure that pollutes the air and water&lt;/a&gt;, call their communities &lt;a href="https://www.greatplainsaction.org/single-post/end-stage-iowa"&gt;“sacrifice zones”&lt;/a&gt; for the meat and agricultural industries.

For whatever reason, I’m here today doing this, and I think of the people that aren’t so lucky.” He mentioned a former coworker, Maria, who had to get carpal tunnel surgery like many other slaughterhouse workers, due to intense wrist pain from making repetitive cuts to animal carcasses. When Magna asked her why she’s still working at the plant, she told him that because she doesn’t speak English, she doesn’t have many options. She said she has to continue on to provide for her kids — that her own life doesn’t matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This system,” Magna said, “oppresses everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; newsletter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPYVBwYUtGZkJlbXVpY0txTGdDdjdPelZma3Jtd3FZY3B3SnYwTlhsbTN2UHliWTQ5cTc0bmJuVTBVTUdDTEhhMXhGYi0waFZpMjdsU3ozWlNHcE9BSk9hY2U2ZnNhVldGZnBOeEY2RlFHZ0VqVWowNFpfYTYyUWFOTzE5RURzc08wejZvM2R0VGtjZw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心健康咨询称，这种“持续风险”使旅行者在飞机、火车、公共交通等方面处于弱势-旅行+休闲 | CDC Health Advisory Says This 'Ongoing Risk' Leaves Travelers Vulnerable on Planes, Trains, Public Transport, and More - Travel + Leisure</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNNlJFd3NnelVWSThUZS02MzBCTEtYSGF3LXJvN0pWQmQ5X0xEX1Z2azVyNnd2UHZITURzcEFEcWE0SUUxYWUwVDVtNHJVS0VqTWMtR2VUMUJQUk5KbnNiQ1U0NmxmQnNnYnhwaXlwdEhZRkVxUFg5SmhfMW00Ml85dktDbjk0MHV6czlESzNTajhJYWV4dHFROUVhMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="travelandleisure-sc-page_1-0" class="comp travelandleisure-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block travelandleisure-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A surge of measles cases has caused the CDC to update its advisory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDC recommends that travelers should get vaccinated to prevent measles before traveling internationally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are at least 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States, according to CDC data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent outbreak of measles has caused a leading health authority to update guidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;travel advisory&lt;/a&gt; and is encouraging international travelers to get vaccinated (or confirm their vaccination status) against the measles virus before heading abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Measles is an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected,” the CDC advisory reads. “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In response to the ongoing risk, the CDC advises all travelers going to or from an international destination to be fully vaccinated against measles. For travelers who are not yet vaccinated or unable to get vaccinated, the government agency encourages people to consult a medical professional and consider postponing their trip until the risk is assessed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The advisory was last reviewed on May 28 by the CDC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Denver International Airport is one site that health authorities have closely monitored as a source of several recent measles cases. At least four passengers on a recent Turkish Airlines flight reportedly caught measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Public health officials are notifying members of the public of additional areas for potential measles exposures, as a result of these confirmed cases,” the Colorado advisory states. “The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There have been 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-six percent of the cases have been unvaccinated or whose status was unknown, and only 12 percent of cases have required hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-measles-travel-warning-spread-in-airplane/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC spokesperson said there have been 62 cases of measles that tie back to international travel thus far in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing, and can remain in the air for up to two hours, the CDC advisory states.&lt;br&gt;

These objects appear to trace back as far as 1.5 million years, shining a spotlight on an era when early humans were shaping simple tools for daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finds come from a pilot &lt;a href="https://press.vub.ac.be/vub-researcher-discovers-hand-axes-that-may-go-back-15-million-years-ago-in-iraqi-desert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; examining surface materials scattered across a dried landscape that once held a vast Pleistocene lake. Archaeologist and researcher, &lt;a href="https://amgc.research.vub.be/dr-ella-egberts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ella Egberts&lt;/a&gt;, is continuing this work at &lt;a href="https://www.vub.be/nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-a-vanished-water-source"&gt;Tracing a vanished water source&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remnants of an ancient lakebed in the Iraqi Western Desert set the stage for intriguing discoveries. Fossilized river channels crisscross this parched terrain, hinting that it was once a lifeline for early humans who may have wandered near water for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators identified seven &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; sites in an area measuring about 6 by 12 miles, selecting one location for a focused look at how objects from different periods were arranged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/geomorphology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;geomorphology&lt;/a&gt;, the study of landform development, crucial in linking these surface deposits to climatic shifts over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-earliest-clues"&gt;The earliest clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Paleolithic materials found at the site include sizable hand axes from a time when toolmaking was still in its infancy. These finds point to the Old (or Early) Paleolithic, a period roughly spanning 2.6 million to 300,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some artifacts might be as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archaeologists-discovered-ancient-footprints-that-rewrite-the-story-of-humans-in-america/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; as 1.5 million years, revealing a remarkable window into the behaviors of people who thrived long before many modern innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fieldwork was a huge success,” stated Egberts. Her focus on surface-level collection rather than deep digging allowed for quick exploration of the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the material was gathered, she organized a preliminary analysis to see how these objects were distributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-middle-paleolithic-techniques"&gt;Middle paleolithic techniques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between about 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans turned to a more structured style of toolmaking. &lt;a href="https://stonetoolsmuseum.com/artefact/europe/levallois-flake/2383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Levallois flakes&lt;/a&gt; are a classic example of this approach, which involves carefully shaping a stone core to produce specific flake forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists often interpret this systematic flaking method as evidence of advanced planning and mental organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early forms of this technique have surfaced in various parts of Southwest Asia, reflecting the spread of carefully prepared stone industries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach differs from the heftier and less refined hand axes that preceded them. Such shifts in design provide researchers with a glimpse into human progress across vast timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-and-collaboration"&gt;Teaching and collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts led instructional sessions with Iraqi archaeology students, who gained first-hand experience handling Paleolithic items and analyzing the surrounding soils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three students joined the field activities to see how scientists record artifact positions and note subtle variations in sediment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workshops at &lt;a href="https://en.qu.edu.iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Al-Qadisiyah University&lt;/a&gt; covered the basics of measuring soil layers and interpreting the evidence of ancient streams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic participants discussed how preserving these sites enriches awareness of cultural heritage. Organizing community presentations helped invite broader interest, including visits to local schools, universities, and conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-life-on-the-ground"&gt;Life on the ground&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crews expected significant logistical hurdles, but they managed to cover the desert terrain without major interruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly interactions with residents smoothed the process, while checkpoints served as routine stops rather than obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project members observed that the openness of the region made surface scanning more straightforward than in areas with dense vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial backing came from the &lt;a href="https://www.bisi.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Institute for the Study of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, which covered initial travel and research costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to collaborate with Iraqi authorities and students allowed scientists to expand their understanding of how early humans once roamed through a network of water sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-exploration-ahead"&gt;Further exploration ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts is assembling resources to keep examining how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/5000-year-old-fort-hidden-in-the-jungle-confirms-ancient-society-sophistication-lidar/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; environments changed throughout the Pleistocene and how people adapted to these fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She intends to map other localities in the Western Desert, aiming to confirm whether the patterns spotted here mirror trends seen in other parts of Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More extensive artifact analysis will also help determine if there are unique signatures linked to certain groups. Drawing on laboratory tools to inspect each item’s shape and wear patterns may yield new angles on migration and cultural expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paleolithic-objects-identified-with-science"&gt;Paleolithic objects identified with science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining geology, archaeology, and advanced imaging techniques often highlights unseen details like micro-flake scars or residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how sites endure in harsh conditions is vital. Researchers hope these fragile archaeological remains will remain protected so future investigators can tap into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This broader perspective fosters more discussions on how heritage and conservation can unite communities and encourage appreciation for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; cultural legacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts will keep weaving these observations into broader debates about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/115000-year-old-human-footprints-found-alathar-lake-arabian-peninsula/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; origins. She seeks to revisit this area of Iraq once funding is in place, aiming to piece together evidence of how shifting climates and varied landscapes influenced life over immense periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By coordinating with government bodies and local institutions, she hopes that ongoing discoveries will reinforce the significance of preserving remnants of the deep past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:48:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOX3BaQnJaM3JhSUpmaTlWb3N6aGRYUjF1ZkFaTWFWbjJLZzNjTFpsbERJZlFoRVkxVzdrWTJmVzQ3aFBGNXUyd2xlUkE1bnV2Sm5heGRfalV6emRvdnNCY1VrR2h0Nk9nUjdKQUw1a3NlT1pQbFdSM0s5TURUX2M0SUhDdURTZFFZTUJvUTJJeGZZY0VLdURJUS0yRQ</guid></item><item><title>一个生酮试验如何在营养世界引发一场新战争- WIRED | How One Keto Trial Set Off a New War in the Nutrition World - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnJLZ3JGVmlxTzZQVXVFU0dDUXRXajNLTUx0YzZibmstNXpjZnZyRFdvdGpXWjZvQWhZbFA1U3c3bHpJRko2S2E1MnpTNjFHNllEYnhCQWd1aDRNRURkLS0zMmxDa2lFd2RVcThhYzloc2hvM0lFQl9VSU1mMUVzbUpxajUta0tFUTNlREdrOEZRbVZEblZGTHdwYmR5X3B6anNVZDJYWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the study was still in the recruitment phase, Nadolsky left the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Entrenched Positions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Klatt, of UC Berkeley, is extremely well-versed in nutrition research and the current online debates around cholesterol.

Klatt discussed the study with Nadolsky while it was ongoing, and many aspects concerned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Klatt brought up issues of undisclosed biases to the Lundquist Institute, the host of the trial, along with Dave Feldman’s “strongly vested interest” in the results of the study that was not properly disclosed, claiming he was “a conflicted party with no training in the biomedical sciences.” His email to the Institute about these issues went unanswered. “I think this study has gotten to the point of being extremely unethical,” Klatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“All authors adhered to the conflicts-of-interest disclosure guidelines the journal required,” Soto-Mata says. “Our study was independently reviewed, approved, and monitored by an expert Research Ethics committee, all its recommendations were followed, and all its standards were met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While some researchers and physicians are tearing the study apart, or using it to show that keto can have adverse effects, Klatt doesn’t draw any strong conclusions. “People are talking past each other,” he says. Generally speaking, there are two clear camps, with one thinking the traditional lipid hypothesis holds up, and another thinking the new lipid energy model might work. Klatt puts himself in a third camp, asking: “Why are we trying to interpret this study at all?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I’m an editor at the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,” Klatt says, “and I would like to believe that we would have rejected this outright without even sending it out for peer review, because it has so many obvious issues.” He is worried about people using this flawed study as proof the consensus on the risks of LDL cholesterol has been “debunked,” which it has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One of the study’s coauthors, Matthew Budoff, a professor of medicine at UCLA as well as an investigator at the Lundquist Institute, acknowledged in an email to WIRED that there had been “incredible scrutiny of the data on social media, which is more than expected based on my prior publications.” He noted the research team is seeking to have the paper incorporate corrections, but that this is ultimately at the discretion of the journal. A response to the Letter to the Editor from the coauthors clarifies some of the issues, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That reply to the Letter to the Editor &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862"}' href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has now been published&lt;/a&gt;—and reveals that the study’s data may support the conventional position on the risk of cholesterol after all. The study’s authors share that the “pooled median change” in NCPV in the participants—the rise in the type of plaque the study was set up to investigate, but which originally wasn’t explicitly quantified in the paper—was an alarming 42.8 percent. The reply goes on to state that the study’s findings were “compatible with a causal role of ApoB in atherosclerosis”—the build-up of fat in the arteries—which they’ve “acknowledged and supported in previous publications.” The letter says that not mentioning this percentage increase in NCPV “was a sincere oversight, not intentional selective reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But this concession comes after the horse has bolted. Feldman’s hypothesis is already appearing in laypeople’s research—with the keto diet having been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9312449/"&gt;among the most Googled diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, and keto products a growing multibillion-dollar industry. Answering the query “What is special about Lean Mass Hyper-Responders,” ChatGPT provides the lipid energy model, Feldman’s argument against the consensus on cholesterol, among the initial explanations for why there is so much controversy and interest. There is also a &lt;em&gt;Cholesterol Code&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414"}' href="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; in the works—which covers Feldman’s personal experience and his research, including this study—which Feldman predicts will be available on a major streaming service sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:18:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnJLZ3JGVmlxTzZQVXVFU0dDUXRXajNLTUx0YzZibmstNXpjZnZyRFdvdGpXWjZvQWhZbFA1U3c3bHpJRko2S2E1MnpTNjFHNllEYnhCQWd1aDRNRURkLS0zMmxDa2lFd2RVcThhYzloc2hvM0lFQl9VSU1mMUVzbUpxajUta0tFUTNlREdrOEZRbVZEblZGTHdwYmR5X3B6anNVZDJYWQ</guid></item><item><title>紧急健康警告，因为在美国购物中心检测到地球上最具传染性的疾病-每日邮报 | Urgent health warning as most contagious disease on Earth is detected at Mall of America - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have revealed that a child who visited the Mall of America - which is about the size of 78 football fields - in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-e0dbf930-4096-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on May 24 has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unvaccinated child from Dakota County, who has not traveled outside of Minnesota in the last month, visited the mall's theme park and they were infectious at the time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who were at the mall on May 24 between 5pm and 9pm may have been exposed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt;The state's health department &lt;/a&gt;warned symptoms of measles - including a blotchy rash, fever and cough - could develop as late as June 14 in those who were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They highlight that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766243/cdc-americans-cancel-flights-worlds-infectious-disease-planes.html"&gt;unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; are most at risk and should watch for signs of the viral disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another case of measles has also been confirmed in Minnesota but it is not &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10924717/Measles-Minnesota-Child-hospitalized-second-isolating-home.html"&gt;said to be related.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This case involves a Washington County adult whose vaccination status is unverified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual was exposed to the virus during domestic air travel outside of Minnesota and is currently recovering at home, as is the child who was infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These incidents bring Minnesota's confirmed measles cases up to four in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health is now working with local health departments and other Twin Cities locations to contact those who were exposed to either case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica Hancock-Allen, the infectious disease division director at MDH, says the case detected at the Mall of America is particularly concerning as there is currently 'no known source'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and healthcare systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is uncertain where the child was exposed and whether others may have been exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota cases come as measles cases in the US &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6695579/More-100-cases-measles-confirmed-nationwide-outbreak-fueled-anti-vaxxers-CDC-says.html"&gt;continue to spike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,088 confirmed measles cases and at least three deaths reported by 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:08:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当心癌症幽灵-切割 | Beware the Cancer Ghosts - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZ2RWaVNGN2xaLVVFYm9ER0syWks2Mnh6eV9NOGxJSkxHRkVueERZQ19OVVhzNDlfdmZHNjRHazVnSFdTSlkzQ0NPWHFRWmtkMXlpWjNCUkNUUmNpNUx3ZFNQMWhnRDRmR2IxcjBCWnNkaVJGcklQeFdCbzlKOGxXWVQtSElMUXZXNFI1bGN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

People I considered very close might disappear altogether. They would be my “cancer ghosts.”&lt;/p&gt;

I had never known anyone my age with cancer or been close to someone going through treatment. How could I expect the people around me to know what to say or do when &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;didn’t even know? I had no idea how to talk to someone with cancer, which questions were okay to ask, what advice (if any) to solicit. If I were my friend, I wouldn’t know what to say to me, either.&lt;/p&gt;

That my connections after cancer would remain more or less the same as they had been before. But it didn’t work; the ghosts materialized anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Naturally, that made me feel worse. But we talked it through and moved on. Then, after all my hair was gone, that friend began drifting into the background until they disappeared entirely. &lt;em&gt;Poof!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His partner, whom I loved. His family, whom I had grown up with. It’s been almost two years now and I haven’t heard from that friend since.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850n45002o3b77lyo7quon@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;Somewhere along the drift, I’d asked, “Had I done something wrong? Was there a deep-rooted issue we needed to process together?” My ghost told me it was nothing like that. They admitted the timing wasn’t great — me being in chemo and all — but said they were focusing on themselves these days and needed to be selfish and set a boundary. “I don’t owe you an explanation,” they had said. That left no room for discussion. &lt;em&gt;Wasn’t I just a bridesmaid at your wedding? &lt;/em&gt;I thought anyway. &lt;em&gt;Why was I not owed an explanation? We’ve been friends since we were 12. Also, I am bald. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850t0j002x3b77mp9q3z0l@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;In my pursuit for answers, I reached out to other survivors to ask if they had been through something similar, if they had an explanation, a theory, anything that could be the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I was looking for. It wasn’t long before their stories poured in — of course they did. As Kristie Redfield, a therapist specializing in oncology and cancer survivorship, points out, the fact that there’s a name for this particular type of friendship breakup “reflects its ubiquity. I hope people enduring cancer see the term as evidence that cancer ghosting is a phenomenon, not an isolated, personal failing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8511nc00363b77ob34bucv@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Emily, a young breast-cancer survivor, told me that while one of her best friends offered vague gestures of support, she never showed up in any substantial way. “I definitely made excuses for her absence, thinking that everyone handles things differently, and that I’m sure she had a reason she didn’t call or come visit,” Emily says of her ghost. Then, Emily’s chemo treatments kept her from attending her friend’s son’s birthday party. “Chemo symptoms come in cycles, and there are some days you feel great and some days you feel like crap,” she says. “I decided on one of the good days to plan a trip to Disneyland. This upset her because she didn’t understand why I could go to a theme park but not her son’s birthday party.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi6g000i3b772w9u2cvz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Some friends &lt;em&gt;poof! &lt;/em&gt;even sooner, like right after a diagnosis. That’s what happened to Natasha, 37, a skin- and breast-cancer survivor who lost “a close co-worker, whom I considered a friend.” The sudden drop in communication, she says, particularly stung given that they had been frontline nurses together during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I was saddened by the experience,” she tells me, “because as nurses, we don’t leave our people behind, as we understand the intricacies of having an illness like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb851u5i003p3b773jw14p2w@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;My ghost had similarly seemingly vanished overnight. But more often, people didn’t leave with a bang. They became transparent so slowly that it was almost imperceptible, until one day, they were inexplicably gone. “The absence happened so gradually that I barely noticed at first: a missed text here, a canceled coffee there. Soon, a day became a week, a week became a month,” Trish, 35, says of a college friend who ghosted her as her breast-cancer treatment intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi8b000k3b77ykd9z56s@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;The heartbreak of losing friends, co-workers, and childhood besties was widely felt among the women I spoke with, but another theme also emerged: the loss of casual connections. These were the mid-tier friendships; the people they grabbed drinks with, bumped into at parties, or shared spontaneous plans with. Because cancer often demands lifestyle shifts, like &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general.html"&gt;cutting back on alcohol due to its link with recurrence&lt;/a&gt;, those changes can reshape how, and with whom, we connect.&lt;/p&gt;

While her friends used to regularly invite her out to shows and parties, after cancer, the invites stopped coming. “I think we just never figured out anything else to do together after that, since I was trying to keep drinking to a minimum,” she says. “And, honestly, it feels a little lazy, because you can absolutely find things to do with people that don’t involve drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

Was my breast cancer simply ‘not a vibe’ for [my ghost’s] carefully curated social calendar?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zic7000n3b77ckoeodgp@published" data-word-count="122"&gt;Perhaps some of these friendships simply were not what they seemed to be in the first place. Caroline, 43, now suspects that the bond between her and her ghost was never really there. She and her then-friend had bonded quickly after she had moved to the neighborhood. Caroline says their dynamic developed into “the kind of besties usually reserved for friendships forged in childhood, someone you’ve known forever.” For close to a year, they spoke multiple times a day, watched each other’s kids, and spent time with each other’s parents. They leaned on one another in emergencies. “We couldn’t believe how much we had in common and how similar we viewed the world,” says Caroline. But then Caroline was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852aep00483b77ixzu9e1e@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Her friend showed up just in time for the photo ops, wearing “Team Caroline” shirts and posting supportive selfies on social media. But once Caroline’s breast-cancer treatment ended and the cameras were gone, her friend also disappeared. To Caroline, this was simply a performance of morality rather than authentic friendship: “A good word to describe how the whole experience made me feel is &lt;em&gt;disposable&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852c95004h3b779ukf5mlr@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;When I asked Redfield why she believes cancer ghosting happens, she offered a few ideas. “It’s possible a person ghosts because they don’t know what to say or do, or they worry that what they can offer is inadequate,” she explains. “It’s also possible that a person ghosts because of fears of their own fragility and mortality — &lt;em&gt;If you can get cancer, I can get cancer &lt;/em&gt;— which may be especially pronounced when young people are diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852gzw004q3b77uwl0etge@published" data-word-count="161"&gt;Asha, 41, believes “it happens when people confuse their discomfort with your pain as a reason to disappear.” Natasha thinks that some people may simply not have the space to take it on: “Maybe she just did not have the capacity to be in the ‘dark’ with me. Maybe it was just too close to home for her and she couldn’t tolerate bad news.” Or maybe it’s because people are just bad at engaging in tough situations. “Society rarely equips us with tools for these difficult conversations, and my friend’s inability to face my illness created a chasm too wide to cross,” says Trish. Redfield suspects that our struggle to meaningfully engage in tough situations may stem from a cultural discomfort with openly discussing illness and death. “Showing up for another requires recognition of shared humanity and vulnerability, which many of us are encouraged to avoid in our day-to-day lives,” she says. “We might lack practice or not see it as a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852p6e004z3b778cmnn5vx@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;I worry I have cancer ghosts because cancer has changed me &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much — that it’s made me harder to relate to, that I’ve drifted too far from the person I used to be, and that I may never fully find my way back. I skip restaurant dates because I’m not gainfully employed. Like Trish and Julie, I can’t go out drinking with my friends like I could before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8531xv005h3b773it4ties@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;“Finishing treatment was, in some ways, the hardest part,” Julie told me, and I knew just what she meant. We spoke about how being in active treatment (surgery, chemo, and radiation) was like having a visible disability, which made it easier in some ways. Our missing hair and eyebrows were visual markers so universally understood that even strangers gave us that hand-over-heart gesture of “knowing” we must really be going through &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. There was a level of compassion and understanding built in without us having to explain anything at all. There was community and people ready to surround us, no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852zzi00583b77iy44awz7@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;But once the hair grew back and people congratulated us for being done, they left. We were far from “done,” though. For young women like Julie and me, breast-cancer treatment involved being put into medically induced menopause for five to ten years, a jarring reality nobody had prepared us for. And unlike a highly visible bald head, our menopause symptoms were invisible, so we were left to navigate that part of the journey alone. While my friends are beginning to build their families, debating whether or not they should have kids, my reality feels worlds apart. My biggest question isn’t if I want children — it’s whether the few eggs I managed to freeze before chemotherapy could become viable embryos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853927005q3b77c82spees@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;I had tried to keep my bar low, thinking if I didn’t change too much, my friendships wouldn’t either. In fact, sometimes I worry that cancer didn’t change me enough — that I didn’t walk away with the profound life lessons I was supposed to, that I didn’t learn to love my body the way facing mortality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have taught me to. Why am I still so obsessed with my weight? Why am I still just as frugal as I was before, hesitating to burn a gifted candle because it feels like burning money? Shouldn’t I have learned to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; a little? But even while I do feel fundamentally the same, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zidv000o3b77hr78ymyy@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;I now know what it’s like to face my mortality, to make impossibly difficult decisions about my body, to advocate for myself as a patient, and to navigate complex medical and insurance systems. I’ve learned just how much support and care matter during such times. I’ve also come to realize that, maybe, there were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to be some people in my life who could not hold space for me in my most vulnerable moments, regardless of the height of my bar. “If someone disappears from your life because you have cancer, it speaks to their capacity, not your worthiness,” assures Redfield.&lt;br&gt;The loss of close friendships during cancer is difficult to reconcile, and I might never have clear answers as to why it happened to me. All I can do is shift my perspective to highlight the good, because there really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a whole lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853fyw005z3b77simsq52g@published" data-word-count="165"&gt;There are the cancer ghosts, but there are also angels. Of course, there were friends and family who never wavered before, during, and after, and those connections have only strengthened and deepened over time. But there were also people I never would have predicted would become my pillars, who came to my side in ways that humble me still. I formed unexpected bonds with so many people, like some of my friends’ mothers — women in a more common age bracket to have gone through breast cancer and menopause themselves. Like my tax guy’s mom, for example. I was doing taxes the same week I was diagnosed, and he offered to introduce me to his mother, a breast-cancer survivor. Karen and I talked on the phone almost every day for a year despite our 30-plus-year age difference and having never met in person. These women understood me in a way few others could, and they now make up a part of my new community post-cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853m0t00683b77f7xt1xsv@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Now, nearly two years out from active treatment, I look at my community with a complicated kind of gratitude. The ghosts remain — some I still grieve, some I’ve made peace with — but they no longer haunt me or overshadow the ones who stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853stf006h3b77y3509hqr@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Trish now calls cancer the “ultimate friendship filter,” separating those who could sit with discomfort from those who fled from it. Her own cancer ghost “felt like another amputation alongside my surgery,” she says. “But it cleared space in my life that has since filled with people whose compassion runs deeper than convenience.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853ubk006q3b77fd8n4ahq@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;I know what she means. Cancer can force a reckoning that’s not easy for anybody, and those left standing with us till the end know that well.&lt;br&gt;I’ve lived through challenges most people avoid talking about or only encounter much later in life: menopause, infertility, a changing body, the loss of libido, the loss of health. We all will eventually face these things in one form or another; I just happened to confront them much earlier than expected. It has not only helped me develop a deeper, more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but to appreciate the depth of support we will all one day need at some point in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853yxt006z3b77ai7eqrkb@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I would still warn anybody going through it, whatever their “it” may be, to &lt;em&gt;beware the ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. But I would also tell them to, more importantly, look out for the living who are still around. Because, in the end, a natural kind of rebalancing tends to unfold when unexpected people step up in the place of those who left. It’s what keeps us moving forward — and, sometimes, that can mean everything.&lt;/p&gt;

Haynes’ work has since been supported by three seven-year NIH awards. The most recent grant was approved in 2019 and is set to expire next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_1140/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_960/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_768/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_640/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_480/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ub4kh0/picture307875290/alternates/FREE_1140/SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" alt="Senior Lab Analyst, Andrew Foulger oversees the production of large batches of proteins in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute research lab on Wednesday, July 13, 2022 in Durham, N.C." title="SAUNDERS-NE-071322-RTW_2.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                            &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Senior Lab Analyst, Andrew Foulger oversees the production of large batches of proteins in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute research lab on Wednesday, July 13, 2022 in Durham, N.C.

Kennedy Jr. has been a vocal opponent of mRNA technologies, which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21898-mrna-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;teach bodies &lt;/a&gt;to ward off infectious diseases by making a tiny part of a virus so immune systems can learn how to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminating CHAVD is part of broader Trump administration cuts to HIV vaccine research. In an emailed statement Tuesday, an HHS spokesperson said the agency has been supporting “duplicative health programs,” including 27 programs addressing HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA),” the spokesperson wrote. “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;June 4, 2025 at 6:30 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

This poses a significant danger for those who like to eat freshly caught freshwater fish. But there are ways to protect yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parasites are called trematodes. Two species of the flatworms were discovered in California’s freshwater fish, according to a study published Tuesday in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf180/8154770?login=false" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;. The tiny, flattened and sluglike creatures can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss and lethargy when a person eats an infected fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare and severe cases, the parasites have caused strokes or heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Americans don’t usually think about parasites when they eat freshwater fish because it hasn’t historically been an issue here,” said Ryan Hechinger, the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact,  even when a person has fallen ill from a locally caught infected freshwater fish, their healthcare provider will typically ask if the patient has recently traveled outside of the United States, Hechinger said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="california-wasnt-this-parasites-first-home" class="subhead"&gt;California wasn’t this parasite’s first home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified two species of trematode: &lt;i&gt;Haplorchis pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Centrocestus formosanus&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two parasite species have historically infected people in Southeast Asia who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/foodborne-trematode-infections#:~:text=People%20become%20infected%20by%20eating,severe%20liver%20and%20lung%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;eat raw fish, crustaceans or vegetables&lt;/a&gt; that carry the parasite larvae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trematode has a very specific life cycle, leeching onto three hosts that include a freshwater snail, a fish and then a bird or human who ate the infected fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite was probably carried to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania, or Malaysian trumpet snail, which is host to a number of parasitic species and was introduced to the United States, Hechinger estimates, decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhabits “freshwater springs, streams, lakes and swamps,” according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://invasions.si.edu/nemesis/species_summary/71533" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,&lt;/a&gt; but can occasionally be found in “brackish and marine habitats, especially mangroves” (think the Everglades). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snail first popped up in California in 1972 in a Riverside County ditch, according to the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hechinger, through &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/227/2/183/6754904?login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; and new research, found that the snail and its associated trematode parasites can be widely found in lakes and reservoirs across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s identified the snails in Los Angeles, Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-fish-harbor-thousands-of-parasites" class="subhead"&gt;Some fish harbor thousands of parasites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summer and fall 2023, researchers, with the help of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, analyzed fresh fish that were collected at five fishing localities in San Diego County: Miramar, Murray, Lower Otay and San Vicente reservoirs as well as Chollas Lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fish included largemouth bass and bluegill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hechinger and his team found that 93% of all the fish in the study were infected with the &lt;i&gt;H. pumilio&lt;/i&gt; parasite, with some individual fish harboring thousands of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second parasite, &lt;i&gt;C. formosanus&lt;/i&gt;, was found at two of the five locations, where it occurred in 91% of the fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

However, the FDA said freezing doesn’t kill all harmful germs, so the safest route is to thoroughly cook your seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-food-prep-is-fishy" class="subhead"&gt;Some food prep is fishy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this study, researchers conducted a survey of 125 YouTube videos with a total of 5 million views and found that 65% of these videos did not mention proper cooking or freezing of caught fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of proper food preparation not only promotes the transmission of parasites but  can also increase the odds of infection, Hechinger said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVEVaNHJBU01zSWx2d0RhWVpnXzNyM1VtWUc5M1ExQVBGZGxESnFlZmtaVWtiREQ4UFZzNHQ4RHBVLWdiREd6dXE0WmVUTlFyQzJ4Y21aLWQ2YW03cU12NFBQckVCM250UURLeURHYy0tbGlVNFFXZFhvXzRjNlFJZGtHNnZBSWJtd005OHlSQTc1M0tXakRzSmFSVVEySXB0NzJXSzVGdGhVdFRSUXc</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：一种罕见的遗传疾病将女性的心脏染成黑色- Live Science | Diagnostic dilemma: A rare genetic disease stained a woman's heart black - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPTmNnZFNZbUEzWGpkdXdZSzBkN05NMmtsdGpLNWlxUVp6c21ZREd0VV80YnNhRTZjOHNtYk9TNlRqS01CdEhyRFk5eUNYMG1Gb2lMQVpFd0JVUUM2VlBuS1FGTjFSc3NHNmw2dk1PTGoxbGR4dXU0RzI2Y0RpdTN3anN0eXVqb3drc3lmVGktYmo4NThsZVdpc1A2cDFLOWJaVDRSb25rdkNSbG5YYnkxOWhzc3VsblZyLWlDcTNPcVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 65-year-old woman in Austria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient had been experiencing shortness of breath during physical activity for several weeks when she went to a hospital for evaluation. She also had a history of passing unusually dark urine, which had been happening since childhood, and in her 40s, she'd had total hip and knee replacements on both sides due to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;The woman's doctors checked her heart function with an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/16947-echocardiogram" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/16947-echocardiogram" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;echocardiogram&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which uses ultrasound to visualize blood flow through the heart's valves and chambers. They also used &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cardiac-catheterization" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cardiac-catheterization" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardiac catheterization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which involves guiding a long, thin tube through the blood vessels and into the heart to further examine its valves and look for blockages and narrowed arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The evaluations revealed that the woman had severe &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23046-aortic-valve-stenosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23046-aortic-valve-stenosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aortic stenosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which the heart's aortic valve is narrowed or blocked. This valve normally opens to allow oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the rest of the body, so stenosis hinders that crucial blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient underwent open heart surgery to have her aortic valve replaced. Thirteen days later, she was discharged from the hospital. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2011/bcr.04.2011.4119" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2011/bcr.04.2011.4119" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the woman's doctors noted that, three years after the surgery, the patient remained free of cardiovascular symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Common risk factors for aortic stenosis include having high cholesterol, high blood pressure or a history of smoking. The condition often coincides with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;&lt;u&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is characterized by plaque buildup in one or more of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. In this patient's case, the coronary arteries appeared normal, but doctors discovered something unusual during her open heart surgery: "black pigmentation" and calcified "dark black" tissues in her aorta and aortic valve, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tissue removed during the surgery was further examined under a microscope. This examination revealed "brown pigment deposition" within hardened areas of the aortic valve and in some of the noncalcified tissues in the structure. Within the hardened valve tissue, the team also found signs of chronic &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the presence of "pigment-laden" immune cells. There was also degeneration within the connective tissues of the valve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qLCs3UhVTpnrdMFkPhrDvJ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qLCs3UhVTpnrdMFkPhrDvJ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, as well as the patient's medical history, the doctors determined that she had a rare genetic condition called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/alkaptonuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/alkaptonuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alkaptonuria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Globally, the inherited disease is thought to affect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560571/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560571/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1 in 250,000 to 1 in 100,000 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although the prevalence varies widely among countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alkaptonuria is caused by mutations in a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/hgd/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/hgd/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HGD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which carries instructions for an enzyme that helps break down two protein building blocks in the body: phenylalanine and tyrosine. These mutations make the enzyme less effective, which causes a buildup of a byproduct of phenylalanine and tyrosine. The byproduct, homogentisic acid, is excreted in urine, which causes pee to darken when it's exposed to air. And in people with alkaptonuria, there's too much homogentisic acid for the body to excrete, so the substance builds up in connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulating acid becomes an "ochronotic pigment," which essentially stains the tissues where it accumulates and eventually calcifies, or hardens. Many people with alkaptonuria require joint replacements because their joints have calcified, and in some people, this calcification also affects the heart. This was the case for the 65-year-old woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult to assess the incidence of cardiac ochronosis accurately because of its rarity," the case report author noted.

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating fat before the carbohydrates didn't lower the blood sugar spike but did delay it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that eating fibre-rich foods like vegetables, and proteins like eggs before tucking into carbohydrates could prevent rocketing blood sugar that leads to a hunger-inducing crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michael Snyder, an expert in genetics author of the study, said diners should try to eat their meals in a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating carbohydrates later in a meal is still a good idea even though it has not yet been sorted out whether it is best to eat protein, fat or fibre before carbohydrates,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat your salad or hamburger before your French fries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also noted that the impact of fibre, protein and fat on blood sugar levels was less significant among participants with signs of pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors, who published their findings in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085535?"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, said this was an area in need of further research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carbohydrates, a group that includes rice, potatoes, bread and pasta, are energy dense foods that are quickly converted to sugar in our blood, giving us the resources we need to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says carbohydrates should make up about a third of a person's daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials urge people to eat wholegrain varieties like brown bread or potatoes with the skin on as these come with higher levels of fibre and nutrients, and can slow the release of sugar in our bloodstream, maintaining fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost 6million Britons have diabetes, of which 90 per cent is type 2, but charities estimate 1.2million are living with the disease undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nationally, an estimated eight per cent of the population of England has the disease, this rises to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14472619/The-diabetes-capital-10-cent-suffer-condition-health-experts-warn-sign-worsening-obesity-crisis.html"&gt;over one in 10 people in some parts of the country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin it makes doesn't work properly. Insulin is a hormone critical to controlling blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having high blood sugar levels over time can cause heart attacks and strokes, as well as problems with the eyes, kidneys and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers may need to overhaul their diet, take daily medication and have regular check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the condition, which is diagnosed with a blood test, include excessive thirst, tiredness and needing to urinate more often.

								&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Julie moved to Massachusetts to start a new job in biotech. She was maintaining her relationship with her partner long distance, and starting a new position in an unknown city alone had her distressed. Her psychologist and doctor recommended she start taking the antidepressant &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/05/23/decades-on-ssris-remain-mired-in-mystery-and-debate_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;Prozac&lt;/a&gt; (fluoxetine) to feel better, and it helped her function — for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then years went by, and she started to develop other symptoms. Her &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/insomnia" target="_blank"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; got worse. She felt oddly detached from herself and she started to have thoughts about suicide that she had not had before. During this time, she was processing traumatic experiences from her childhood in therapy, but she felt like these symptoms were being exacerbated by Prozac. So in 2022, Julie started tapering off of her medication after talking with her primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just continued taking it, sort of without questioning,” Julie, who is using a pseudonym to protect her privacy, told Salon in a phone interview. “I came to believe that Prozac was causing more problems than it was helping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants like Prozac were a major breakthrough in psychiatry when they were first marketed in the 1980s. However, their use has become so widespread in the U.S. that some argue they are now being overprescribed. In fact, an entire internet subculture has developed to help people get off of their antidepressants, which doctors warn can be dangerous if not performed under the medical supervision of a health care provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; issued in February, President Donald Trump said the administration would “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,” referring to SSRIs, a common class of antidepressants and other psychiatric medications. During his testimony at the Senate Finance Committee, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also said that antidepressants were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3O4z_UbxlY"&gt;harder to get off than heroin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/hey-lets-not-get-carried-away-anti-depressants-really-do-help-people/257976/"&gt;life-saving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/i-was-wary-of-antidepressants-but-they-helped-when-nothing-else-could"&gt;life-enhancing&lt;/a&gt; for many people, but for most people with mild or moderate forms of depression they are not intended for long-term use. The drugs can also carry side effects that can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, including weight gain, sexual dysfunction and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628765/"&gt;emotional blunting&lt;/a&gt;, in which people feel fewer positive emotions along with negative ones. While Kennedy is wrong — antidepressants are not harder to stop using than heroin — the withdrawal process can come with its own side effects as well, which some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/antidepressant-withdrawal-symptoms-doctors-side-effects"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; is an underrecognized problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are very individualized things,” said Dr. Mark Olfson, a psychiatrist at Columbia University. “There is no one-size-fits-all in terms of how people make trade offs between the burdens of staying on the medication versus the protection the medication offers some individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used antidepressants today are SSRIs like Prozac, which came on the market in 1988. In the decades that followed, the prevalence of SSRI prescriptions continued to increase year over year to a climax in the pandemic when the proportion of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health-care.htm"&gt;U.S. population taking antidepressants approached 25%&lt;/a&gt;. This more than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3162179/"&gt;tripled the proportion of people on them in 1990&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression has also increased over the years, or at least has been detected in more people. Yet the proportion of the population with depression remains lower than the proportion on antidepressants, in part because these medications are also commonly prescribed for other conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, insomnia and anxiety — which has also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905958/"&gt;increased in the U.S. in recent decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some believe they are inappropriately prescribed for too long, or in cases when lifestyle changes or psychotherapy should be tried first. However, many people with depression and severe anxiety who could benefit with antidepressants are also not getting the help they need, Olfson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think there was and maybe still is overprescription,” he told Salon in a phone interview. “But at the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although antidepressant use is still on the rise, a &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240492"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; Olfson co-authored last month found that, for the first time since these drugs were introduced, the use of psychotherapy increased at a higher rate than medication alone. This may in part be due to the increased availability of telehealth counseling, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's still the case that most people with depression or anxiety who receive treatment receive antidepressants, but in the last few years, a rising proportion of them are receiving psychotherapy and the growth of psychotherapy has occurred more quickly than the growth of antidepressants,” Olfson said. “This change is coming after years and years of medications just sort of dominating mental health care in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, psychotherapy remains steeped in stigma and inaccessible to many. This may be one reason that antidepressants are prescribed when other strategies could work as well. Sometimes a person’s only point of contact with a medical professional who could help them with depression is their family doctor, who could refer them to a psychologist. But if they are not available or too expensive, patients are left with few options other than antidepressants, explained Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University, who said we often end up using antidepressants “as a matter of structural convenience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, if you look at the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/guideline.pdf"&gt;practice guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, they recommend that for mild to moderate depression, it is better to start with psychotherapy and lifestyle change and reserve antidepressants for cases of mild to moderate depression that are not getting better or those of more severe intensity,” Aftab told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie struggled to find an affordable psychiatrist in her area that could help guide her through the process of getting on antidepressants back in 2017. Her primary care doctor ended up overseeing her prescription, but once she got on Prozac, they didn’t really discuss it anymore, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftab said this can happen often: “They just put people on antidepressants and then they kind of forget about it and it just keeps getting refilled,” he said. Then, the discussion about whether the medication is working or if they need to stay on it "doesn't really happen,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem with staying on antidepressants longer than necessary is that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39394455/"&gt;withdrawal symptoms can be more difficult the longer you stay on them&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is stopping antidepressants, it's recommended to wean off them slowly and under medical supervision because doing so too quickly and without the right dosage can be dangerous. It can lead to side effects such as a symptom called "brain zap" in which patients feel sudden shocks in their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on a range of factors including the dosage and medication, it can take months or more. Julie did it in eight weeks, but she experienced symptoms that were worse than the original depression she felt, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My biggest symptom after that was extreme anhedonia, like a feeling of not being myself or getting pleasure from anything — almost not feeling human,” she said. “Along with extreme physical fatigue, both of those symptoms lasted for about two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the withdrawal from antidepressants can be mistaken for the return of the original depression it was intended to treat. This could lead some people to go back on medication, if the feeling is so uncomfortable that being on the medication ends up providing relief, Aftab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is &lt;a href="https://karger.com/pps/article/94/1/3/916620/Hidden-Costs-The-Clinical-and-Research-Pitfalls-of"&gt;relatively limited research&lt;/a&gt; exploring the right protocol to get off of antidepressants and how to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, Aftab said. There is even still much debate about what causes depression in the first place. In 1967, an English psychiatrist named Alec Coppen proposed the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;“serotonin theory,”&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain caused depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the pharmaceutical industry developed Prozac, the first SSRI. However, in the decades that followed, some &lt;a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/exploring-the-star-d-controversy" target="_blank"&gt;questions were raised about the trials&lt;/a&gt; used to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRIs. Around the same time, researchers started to question the serotonin theory that had been publicized as a potential cause of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Moncrieff, a professor of critical and social psychiatry at University College London, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Nature in 2022 that concluded there was “no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t conclude that depression is related to serotonin abnormality,” Moncrieff told Salon in a phone interview. “The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory: They thought it was an established scientific fact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncrieff’s paper received significant backlash, with five responses published in the journal along with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02095-y"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; authored by 35 academics that challenged Moncreiff’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the cause of depression is far more complex than something operating on a single neurotransmitter like serotonin, said Philip Cowen, a professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Oxford and one of the co-authors on the comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, that doesn't mean these drugs don't help people. For one, it's common for medications to not target the direct cause of illness. Instead, many are designed to alleviate symptoms and suffering, Cowen explained. For example, asthma inhalers activate receptors, which relax the airways to help facilitate breathing. This helps with asthma symptoms but does not treat the direct cause of asthma, which is ultimately an allergic reaction. A similar thing may be happening with antidepressants, Cowen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The serotonin theory] is a simplistic view and it can't be right,” Cowen told Salon in a phone interview. “Taking SSRIs might make you feel better for various psychological reasons, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's working on a fundamental problem with serotonin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these medicines are still not fully understood, the fact remains that antidepressants do help many people feel better. Yet the back and forth within the medical community about the efficacy of antidepressants and the cause of depression might be &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-constant-trashing-of-antidepressants-is-absurd" target="_blank"&gt;why some have grown to mistrust them&lt;/a&gt;. Other &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/antidepressants-addictive-has-been-debunked-psychiatry-depression-withhdrawal-symptoms"&gt;false claims in the media and some scientific papers&lt;/a&gt; have stated that antidepressants can be addictive like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on misleading criticisms from the White House, and more people are likely to get off of them, said Rifaat El-Mallakh, a psychiatrist who leads the Mood Disorders Research Program at the University of Louisville Depression Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have your leaders saying things like, 'it's harder to get off an antidepressant than it is to get off heroin,' you say, ‘Oh my god, I better get off now before I'm stuck on this forever,’” El-Mallakh told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As distrust grows and it remains challenging for many people to access psychotherapy or medical treatment, many are seeking advice online. In fact, there is an entire &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/health/laura-delano-psychiatric-meds.html"&gt;subculture online&lt;/a&gt; where people talk about getting off of their psychiatric medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Julie did talk with her primary care doctor about getting off her medication, she felt there were more resources on the internet, she said. As she explained: “Most of the support I got through that process was just through online forums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty of the withdrawal process, Julie has been tempted to go back on them again during challenging parts of her life. If she is ever in a place where she feels like her own safety is threatened by her mental health, she would consider it, she said. At the same time, she questions whether she actually needed them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish we had a different culture in the medical care community around recommending antidepressants,” she said. “If they were treated more as a last resort, then maybe I would have made a different choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Julie feels more stable these days and developed strategies in the process of the antidepressant withdrawal that help her move through challenging moments, she said. Some of her symptoms, like problems with her libido, have not fully recovered. But she has started exercising again and feels like her body is more responsive to lifestyle changes she implements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think getting better is now a bit more under my control,” she said. “So there is potential for things to keep improving.”&lt;/p&gt;

Seminole’s outbreak didn’t deter the group, which &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1892697323580592382" target="_blank"&gt;wrongly&lt;/a&gt; suggested it had been caused by a local vaccination campaign and then &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1894036984814883242" target="_blank"&gt;floated other&lt;/a&gt; contradictory theories: that the vaccines were failing, shedding the measles virus, or perhaps working too well, leading somehow to a super virulent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Myrick watched her neighbors repeat these distortions in a local Facebook group, “Seminole TX Residents NEED to KNOW,” sometimes naming her directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every doctor that pushes the jabs gets commission from the big Pharma,” one woman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late February, the Gaines County library posted a flyer “kindly” asking that unvaccinated and measles-sick patrons not come in.

Run on about $2 million in grants a year, the health department’s responsibilities are broad — vaccines and family planning, but also disaster response, fire protection, food safety, landfills, inspections, permits and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Holbrooks didn’t see measles coming, though he is quick to say he probably should have — vaccine exemptions in Gaines County had more than doubled in the last 10 years, and about 1 in 5 kindergarteners were now skipping the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the first cases were confirmed at the end of January, “my heart sank,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The district kept only a couple of doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines on hand — enough for new families moving into the area, not to meet the sudden need of an outbreak. The two epidemiologists Holbrooks had on staff were immediately overwhelmed by case investigations. Holbrooks also didn’t have outreach materials in Low German or a relationship with the Mennonite community, which he now urgently needed a way into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He turned to the state, which brought in nurses, testing supplies and vaccines. He set up a vaccine and testing clinic outside Seminole Hospital District; a spray-painted arrow on unfinished plywood signaled where to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQTkZhclNBRFVWU3lzTGV3STFVVV9DRGJENzVhQ3k4SnZnbWs2bm9FY2puSFlsMVo2OXFXTGZkbS1NakxWci1ZbVFmdjBQVWNTenFqV1VueFdVR1kxMWdraTVqVGJPMFdPbG1Ed1VOSDJIaDBaTzdvckNxTElDczk0QXBaNi1EU0lrVzM4cWtRbEhLODhDLUdvSWQ1ZEJlZlFvb2oxeXNfONIBVkFVX3lxTFB4V1dON2V1Q3Z6aFp2UmV6Z3ViWnhVUXV1ZjdJTXA0UHRlMEtkT1NYd1JKR0JfLThXekRkVE8zOHpfNFZRZG1DdFE0d0tBeFNJRXVNa0RR</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现有前途的新型阿尔茨海默氏症治疗方法- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Promising New Alzheimer’s Treatment - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8</guid></item><item><title>为什么随着年龄的增长，宿醉会更加严重，你能做些什么？ -每日野兽 | Why Do Hangovers Hit Harder as You Age—and What Can You Do About It? - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOX1Z2SjFYbEJrNXRlX0hDUnpFeENCSHZfMXgtQVg0cUMteFZJWDBzVncyT0ZjWHZ3SURxMU03VDlhN2hER255NXBsTTFPUHQ3dF9VdExDci03OGlObUFSdjlCLTdzaDI2azRJeDZGZVV3cUNVWG5feV9ybTVtaU1YUFh4Qm9td01ScUJmTmxkUTdtRkdJVU85SVEyWnVZZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="container story-layout-standard-tdb" id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;a class="skip-main" href="#main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="use-svg"&gt;&lt;symbol id="youtube-icon" viewbox="0 0 37 37

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services’ &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;budget for 2026&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/kennedy-maha-commission-report-chronic-disease-new-data-how-to-prioritize/"&gt;chronic disease epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it would also abolish the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this center is eliminated, state and local departments lose core prevention funds. And they lose the workforce for schools, chronic disease prevention, data collection, surveillance systems,” a senior official at the CDC chronic disease center told STAT on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “If folks care about kids, schools rely on this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal health leaders want to fold the chronic disease center into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity within HHS that will also bring other centers under its umbrella: the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The proposal asserts these moves will strengthen the response to chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AHA will administer $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic,” the proposal reads. “It will prioritize prevention — a missing piece in the American health system — primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, workforce development, and policy, research, and oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That leaves the current chronic disease center in limbo, its budget diminished, its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;workforce&lt;/a&gt; disbanded by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/11/hhs-layoffs-analysis-health-impact-nih-cuts-cdc-rif-fda-reduction-in-force/"&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; contested in court, and its location to be determined as its surviving programs are scattered. The president’s funding requests tend to undergo big changes before Congress passes a budget, but for now, public health experts are expressing puzzlement about how this proposal might harmonize with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/rfk-jr-maha-commission-report-key-takeaways-ultraprocessed-foods-environmental-toxins-overmedicalization/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks pretty devastating for chronic disease when they’re saying that they’re really interested in prioritizing chronic disease,” Philip Huang, a physician and director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told STAT. “And then that MAHA report that came out — I mean, it’s a very limited agenda that they’re talking about in terms of how to address chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving prevention to AHA may give rise to more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT. Part of that is uncertainty about which programs may survive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That other agency does not exist right now,” she said. “You’re not just shifting the work. That would be something that has to get built up. So we’re losing the people who do the work right now. We don’t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson from HHS defended the decision, saying complex, duplicative health programs have led to fragmented efforts that dilute taxpayer resources and their impact on Americans. Some CDC programs will continue under AHA, the message emailed Tuesday also said, adding, “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not visible on the AHA agenda: the CDC’s program to encourage smoking cessation, which has already &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/cdc-closing-office-smoking-health-called-gift-to-big-tobacco-by-former-osh-director/"&gt;fallen to the budget ax&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that makes no sense to Huang, who, years ago in his role as chronic disease director for Texas, traveled the state to urge restaurants to go smoke-free. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For them to have eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health is absolutely insane if you say you’re trying to address chronic disease,” he said. Among preventable causes of chronic disease, “tobacco is the most blatant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC official also called smoking cessation one of public health’s most effective interventions, “like smallpox elimination for chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new generation of young people, exposed to pitches selling e-cigarettes and tobacco pouches, might hear messages only from advertisers and not campaigns foundational to preventing heart disease, stroke, and cancer, the CDC official added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huang was struck by Kennedy’s answer when asked to name the leading preventable cause of death among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What he’s saying are the primary drivers of chronic disease are ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, technology, and medications, including vaccines,” Huang said. “They may be factors, but we know a lot of what causes these chronic diseases. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of disease, and he couldn’t even identify that during his hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conservative voices have been &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/cdc-dismantle-trump-administration-00146035" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calling for the CDC&lt;/a&gt; to return to its roots, narrowing its scope to infectious diseases like the one that inspired its creation and its location in the southeastern United States: malaria.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1946, the CDC’s expertise and activities have grown deeper and wider, as the “prevention” in its name implies, to include a multitude of diseases, studying their origin, treatment, prevention, and prevalence. The agency’s knowledge, standards, and investigations are shared around the world and in all U.S. states and territories.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of noncommunicable diseases is long, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, maternal mortality, obesity, mental illness, epilepsy, and dementia. So is the tally of causes in addition to tobacco: high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, limited physical activity, poor access to cancer screening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the CDC’s footprint shrinks to communicable disease outbreaks, the chronic disease center’s program will be splintered. The pain would be felt far from headquarters in Atlanta, the CDC official said. That’s because 80% of the dollars funding the center at CDC now flow to state, territorial, and local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prevention as a whole is being deprioritized, so that will put pressure on clinics in the health care delivery system to do what they’re not doing now: prevention outside the clinic, in neighborhoods, to prevent heart disease, diabetes, cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The budget plan would provide $500 million “to tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,” of which $260 million would fight chronic illness by addressing nutrition and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That would include $119 million for a new Prevention Innovation Program, which the proposal said would improve the health of Americans through reliable broadband technology integration, “ensuring access to nutrition services and physical activity venues, and reducing dependence on medication.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A May 22 &lt;a href="https://www.warnock.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FY26-CDC-Approps-Letter-_Final-Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;letter from 29 U.S. senators&lt;/a&gt; in response to President Trump’s budget proposal urged lawmakers to protect robust funding for the CDC as a whole while singling out its chronic disease center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The elimination of the CDC’s chronic disease prevention office also contradicts the Administration’s stated goal of addressing the chronic disease epidemic in our country,” the letter said. “These cuts will not make Americans healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the national center’s major roles is to provide the comprehensive data collection and analysis to public health departments across the country, a division of labor that allows small staffs to do more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Orcena, public health commissioner for Union County, Ohio, said there’s a valuable synergy between the CDC and his office, which serves 70,000 people in a county that includes both suburban and rural areas with differing health needs. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There’s a heavy reliance on those national surveillance tools to help frame the work we do locally as part of our local community health assessments and community health improvement plan,” he said. “That’s one of the things the center and CDC in general does and the state does as well. We rely on them through that economy of scale to have truly experts in these areas because I can’t afford to have someone be an expert in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked what disease or condition concerns him the most, Orcena said, “the one I don’t know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed out that there are 3,300 departments across the country, some with hundreds of employees and some with just two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re the gap filler for people to make sure that even within the traditional medical system, things don’t fall through the cracks,” he said about individual public health systems. “If you start seeing a new cancer developing, that’s going to be picked up by the chronic disease center.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Case in point: HIV was initially recognized after a rare cancer related to the infection began showing up in men who had sex with men, later linked to the disease that became an epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the division that’s going to figure that out. It’s not NIH,” Benjamin said about the chronic disease center at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the state and local level, public health officials are facing confusing messages on funding for individual projects. Earlier this year they weathered the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-local-officials-react-rif-impacts-public-health/"&gt;loss of money to pay for Covid-19 programs,&lt;/a&gt; many of which had pivoted to cover health needs beyond Covid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because chronic disease has long been underfunded and underappreciated, partnerships between local health departments and a national system is crucial, NACCHO’s Casalotti said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bringing all these parts together could move us towards a place so we can focus more on these diseases,” she said. “Right now, what they’re seeing and experiencing is actually pulling back from this work, not necessarily pushing it forward. And so I think that’s where the field needs to go: We need to be pushing forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
