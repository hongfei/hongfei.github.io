It really depends on who you ask. I’m not talking about potentially risky biodefense lab research, but something that doesn’t yet exist: mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s a refresher on normal biology: the cells in our bodies are composed of the building blocks of life. Nucleotides and sugars make up our DNA, which provides the blueprint for cells and codes for proteins that carry out key biological functions. In all of life, these biomolecules have a specific “handedness.” (Bear with me here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A mirror image is possible, the way your left and right hands are mirror images of each other. But mirror life can’t evolve from existing life in nature. If it eventually emerges, it’s because we’ve created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/origin-chiral-biomolecules"&gt;chiral&lt;/a&gt;: they can’t be superimposed on their mirror images. All life uses the same chirality. The hope, and fear, is that the opposite — synthetic life based on left-handed genes and right-handed proteins — exists on the bonus B-side of the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As &lt;a href="/future-perfect/393048/mirror-life-mirror-bacteria-existential-risk-science-biology-apocalypse"&gt;my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained&lt;/a&gt; back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. The technologies that would allow us to do so aren’t yet up to the task. But we’ve &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628113/"&gt;encountered&lt;/a&gt; mirror biomolecules like right-handed amino acids in nature, and scientists have synthesized mirror enzymes capable of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; mirror genes. With the power of chemistry, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; mirror proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These mirror biomolecules are the building blocks of mirror life, but they are not mirror life itself. This distinction is really important, and not only because I’m being pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-2327/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;last year &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/12/unprecedented-risk-to-life-on-earth-scientists-call-for-halt-on-mirror-life-microbe-research"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/31/mirror-life-scientists-push-for-ban/85866520007/"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/pause-mirror-life/"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So if those are the risks, then we definitely shouldn’t pursue the creation of mirror life. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, only if we accept that those &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Something that’s gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror &lt;em&gt;biomolecule&lt;/em&gt; research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-brief-argument-against-mirror-life" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (brief) argument against mirror life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But first, let’s get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/kate-adamala"&gt;Kate Adamala&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist building synthetic cells at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;paper, received a 2019 grant to develop and deploy mirror cells. Upon looking into it further, she decided that the risks far outweighed the benefits, and called for the work to be halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don’t replicate, so they don’t pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collapse of entire ecosystems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The inability to develop robust medical countermeasures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The possibility that mirror bacteria would be completely resistant to predation by other microbes that prey on bacteria and keep their population under control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper’s co-authors, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scientists-urge-ban-developing-mirror-image-bacteria"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet’s many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could see a mass extinction event, an existential threat to multicellular life as we know it. Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. If you have the time, it’s worth reading the 299-page &lt;a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:cv716pj4036/Technical%20Report%20on%20Mirror%20Bacteria%20Feasibility%20and%20Risks.pdf"&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt; that explains how the study authors came to their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn’t be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Right now, we create mirror therapeutics chemically, putting them together atom by atom. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, &lt;a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/health-medicine/mirror-life/"&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry are relatively small fields, and mirror biology is even smaller. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. &lt;a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/david-perrin"&gt;David Perrin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scale of the threat is unclear, because mirror organisms might be hopelessly outcompeted by regular life. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Mirror organisms might struggle to find food they need to proliferate. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there’s no way to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The more I think about this, the more I realize that the real concern ought to be with creating life on this side of the mirror,” Perrin told me. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? We wouldn’t know anything about RNA. And we wouldn’t have any radioactive treatments for cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/gigi-kwik-gronvall"&gt;Gigi Gronvall&lt;/a&gt;, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper’s concerns were very theoretical. While she strongly supports the authors’ advocacy for discussion around the issue, she thinks that any proposed funding and research ban “puts the cart before the horse” and could impede research leading to surprising scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We don’t fully understand the risks of mirror life, and we won’t without more research. But this research could be purely &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202500051"&gt;computational&lt;/a&gt;, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creating mirror life could help us &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-are-all-proteins-left-handed-new-theory-could-solve-origin-of-life-mystery"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that the idea of a second tree of life, side B of the biological recording, is really cool. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t be worried about potential risks here. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And we really do need these discussions. I’m glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/events"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; events to facilitate them. It’s unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility. Certainly, there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQQjM5bGhKeVVtdmdnTlZkSWRhNTZFOFdQOUxadm9ka0dSMzJSOFFLOTZSX0RHQVNxbmVaajVuQ1dGaEtnWFRPV003T2pxTjJzZmRacVl0NW5VcS1HczM1eko5VkNnNjQtcDRxYmE2WmEzb0pUemw5ay0xR1RHU0RvdDVuSmdINXB0S1V1S2RqVEF3OEFXdU9tOC1mVzJYaHc</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的下一个疫苗目标- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/10/10/rfk-vaccine-aluminum-trump-ban</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkSEgyOWpqSXRCUXJ3el9uTGYtckdNamJMVTFQN1NFekttRlZqWmlKdTZ5c0N0SjFDd0FNTWZOYnpEM212bDEtWmt3a3VreVU0d1hCSG1nNDNVY0llNEFZNmcwN2l2X1FKNmw4bVBhb0M</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的麻疹疫情继续增加病例数- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A deadly measles outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;ended in August&lt;/a&gt;, but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year’s record national total.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00043b6nnvd0clai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There’s a &lt;a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/news/2025/10/confirmed-case-of-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;new outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html" target="_blank"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/media/pdfs/2025/COCA-Call-Slides_09.11.25_Combined-FINALV2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00063b6nj94nfg7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00093b6n10jfaug5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000a3b6nlu1h1mqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000b3b6n688f1ofb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000c3b6njfq9do4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000d3b6nqo077tda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0lj6q00073b6qkahyoz2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqhkbe00003b6niazx1wvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqowk600063b6n86q7r31d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000e3b6nfk2w2ta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000f3b6nfvnzppuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000g3b6n9gi39iyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000h3b6n7tgrk0ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000i3b6nm2ilcov6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fviruses-parasites-bacterial-infections%2Fmeasles-rubeola%2F2025&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682558291%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SKMKDLZxmtHJsEinaRbgQpFMfnUegLGeorSRI9Uvpgk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to the state health department&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000j3b6nt177sdu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fhealth-wellness%2Fchild-teen-health%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-data%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-and&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682582140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qgZ8%2FHacZhsiUkvcIbGmx2FOA4QM%2FSkkgllcqI%2B7dlw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000k3b6nuyecv3fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000l3b6nb43ydux3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000m3b6n8jblw2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000n3b6n0l3t04qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000o3b6nf75iv9yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000p3b6nzvf2h6s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000q3b6ndkruzg2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment"&gt;fully endorse&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000r3b6nvloqs722@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0uubm00003b6qhkfvzpga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000t3b6njojkbq7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;a new poll shows&lt;/a&gt;, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;i&gt;Childhood in the Past&lt;/i&gt;, Ph.D. candidate Duru Yağmur Başaran &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17585716.2025.2555855" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of an analysis of an over 900-year-old skeleton of a child. The study revealed that a 2.5 to 3.5-year-old child had suffered from a rare disease seldom seen in archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Excavated from the archaeological site of Aphrodisias, located in southwestern Türkiye, the remains were recovered in 1985 from the site of Tetrapylon Cemetery, dated to around the 10th–12th century, placing it firmly in the Middle Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grave, labeled "Tomb 73A" (S-TET-II-85 Tomb 73A), contained the remains of two non-adults, including children 73A and B. Skeleton 73A exhibited unusual skeletal deformations, including thickening and swelling of various bone elements, including parts of the child's jaw, shoulder blade, and shafts of the left arm bones. The left ulna (lower arm bone) in particular had swollen to nearly double its usual size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the remains revealed the child to be around 3 years old, although there was a discrepancy between the estimated age based on the long bones (1.5–2 years) and the teeth (2.5–3.5 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine what disease could have caused these deformities, several diseases and their characteristics were compared to the skeletal remains of the Aphrodisias child. These illnesses included hemolytic anemias, scurvy, rickets, tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/child+abuse/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt;, and infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many of these diseases did not quite match the deformities observed on the bones of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the list of diseases, the Aphrodisias child showed the greatest resemblance to ICH, also known as Caffey disease. This &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rare disease&lt;/a&gt; usually develops in early infancy and affects various skeletal elements and surrounding connective tissues. It typically develops around 5 months of age, though it can present itself as early as birth and even in utero. Interestingly, the disease normally also resolves itself around age three, though it may recur in rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Aphrodisias child showed early signs of recovery just before its death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is characterized by asymmetrical thickening of bone caused by the inflammation of the periosteum (the membrane covering bones), which leads to new bone layers being deposited. The disease most commonly affects the jaw, forearm (ulna), shin bone, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/collar+bone/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collar bone&lt;/a&gt;, shoulder blade, and ribs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this disease may have contributed to the discrepancy between the age estimate in the bones and teeth, as bones are more susceptible to environmental stressors such as malnutrition. Such factors are likely to occur, especially in ICH, as it affects the jaw, making it difficult to feed children suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aphrodisias child is one of only a handful of known archaeological ICH cases. In fact, the disease, including its cause and the reasons for resolving itself, remains difficult to diagnose even in modern clinical settings. However, some known symptoms include fever, irritability, thickening of the bones, and swelling of the overlying soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease seems to develop sporadically and disappear spontaneously, although some familial cases have been reported, indicating there may be some hereditary factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ph.D. candidate Başaran, it is unclear if the child died from ICH, "Unfortunately, the cause of death cannot be determined in most cases where we only have skeletonized remains. It is possible that the individual passed away from ICH, complications that arose from ICH, or a completely unrelated matter."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case contributes to our understanding of non-adult health in Middle Byzantine Aphrodisias. Additionally, the addition of this case to the record of known ICH cases in archaeology contributes to developing a more refined and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/reliable+method/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;reliable method&lt;/a&gt; of diagnosing the disease in historic and prehistoric contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans say that given the choice, they &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/views-and-experiences-with-end-of-life-medical-care-in-the-us-findings/#:~:text=As%20other%20research%20has%20shown,nursing%20home%20(1%20percent)." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;would prefer to die at home&lt;/a&gt;, but about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15090940/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. occur after admission to an intensive care unit. In the book “&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=2986930&amp;amp;m=97137&amp;amp;afftrack=64273215e4b02a8d518e9b1f&amp;amp;urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fextreme-measures-finding-a-better-path-to-the-end-of-life%2F9780525533412" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Extreme Measures: Finding a Better Path to the End of Life&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Jessica Zitter details what she calls the “end-of-life conveyor belt” — a type of care in which dying ICU patients receive painful treatments to be kept at alive at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, by the time someone is on the conveyor belt, it’s often too late to talk to them about what they want. And then everybody is trying to play catch-up. And it’s hard to get it right when the chips are down and there’s so much emotion,” said Zitter, who specializes in palliative medicine and critical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So my recommendation is to talk about these issues early on in life, maybe starting when you become an adult. Start to think about your mortality, and visualize how you would want things to go for you when you get into that stage of life, the end stage. Communicate honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out forms for so-called advance care planning goes a long way. But “it’s as important that you, number one, identify a person you trust — or two or three [people] — that can honor your wishes,” Sethi said, “and have the conversations ahead of time, before you’re in the state where you can’t communicate your needs and wishes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hospice workers recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fivewishes.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Five Wishes&lt;/a&gt;, an advance care planning program, as one way to get clarity on how you want things to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan recommended playing a card game called &lt;a href="https://codaalliance.org/go-wish/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;GoWish&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, a partner or someone else you hope will follow your end-of-life wishes. “[The cards] have different statements on them about possibilities of what you might want or not want,” she said. “And you make stacks of the ones that you like, the ones that you know you don’t care about, and the ones that you’re not sure about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone playing the game may find it difficult to choose which cards represent their values, which is why Morgan suggests having two people play together, so that it can be a conversation starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that there is no one right way to die, and preferences may differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are people who feel that every moment of life is precious and that they value the length of life over the quality of life,” Eichholz-Heller said. “So they are willing to endure a certain amount of suffering to be able to be kept alive. Then there are other people who value quality of life over length of life. And they would rather focus on comfort, even if it means that they won’t live as long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are still a lot of negative associations with hospice care, even though it can be helpful. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between palliative care and hospice. Palliative care workers help to make patients comfortable at any stage of their life if they’re suffering; hospice is a medical service specifically for people with a short-term life expectancy. While anyone living with a serious illness can seek palliative care, Medicare will help cover hospice care costs for people in the U.S. if their health care provider certifies that they are terminally ill and have &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;six months or less&lt;/a&gt; to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people wrongfully assume that going into hospice automatically shortens the life of a patient. Smith said she has been called a murderer for working in hospice care, adding that the worst myth about hospice workers is that they kill their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think that when you go on hospice, it’s a death sentence and that death is imminent,” Smith said. She cited former President Jimmy Carter, who &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/former-president-jimmy-carter-enters-hospice-care-charity_n_63f13659e4b0c87f32f1a4f2" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780"&gt;entered&lt;/a&gt; hospice care in February and is still alive today, as one prominent example of how that is not always the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, research shows that seeking palliative care at an early point can improve quality of life. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, one study on advanced lung cancer patients found that offering early palliative care on an outpatient or ambulatory basis led to fewer clinically significant depressive symptoms and a longer median survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When patients are suffering, they use so much of their energy just to fight the suffering that if we can make them comfortable, they sort of stabilize,” Eichholz-Heller said. “And a lot of times, it really helps them to live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospices can differ in their approach to care and the additional services they offer. There are resources that can help you figure out &lt;a href="https://americanhospice.org/learning-about-hospice/choosing-a-hospice-16-questions-to-ask/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the right questions to ask&lt;/a&gt; to select the best hospice for you or a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t control death. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9357-crohns-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 after over a year of significant pain and major GI problems. I was hospitalized more than once during this year and was referred to a GI doctor in my area. He gave me several reasons for the immense pain I was in: First was that my seat belt probably flung back and hit me, causing a bruise (I didn’t have any bruising). When I told him it was not just pain but that I was also physically sick after eating, he said, 'Well, eat less pizza and drink less beer, and you'll be fine.' It was almost every meal, but sure."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"He referred me for an endoscopy, told me that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes people just have abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many months of trying to be taken seriously, I switched doctors. With only one test, the new doctor diagnosed me with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease and began a treatment plan that had me in remission within a year. I still manage my Crohn’s with the treatment plan he started a decade ago. When I left that area, I wish I could’ve brought him with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first doctor, though, fully dismissed my pain as the naive ranting of a 'girl' in her 20s. I’ve never felt so belittled by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 38, Buffalo, NY&lt;/p&gt;

Back in the days before we had endless ways to communicate—when we all had landlines—my mom called my Nana every Wednesday, and my dad usually called his parents every Tuesday or Thursday … I can’t quite remember.

It can be so hard to get your head around the fact that biological pregnancy is not going to work. But as someone going through IVF myself, let me say: the LW has not been paying attention to the details if she thinks having sex with Manny one time is going to solve her problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32k002n3b6imtpfpy0k@published"&gt;Did the doctor definitively say that the reason conception has failed is her husband’s sperm? Does she know with certainty that she has numerous viable eggs that can fertilize unassisted? Does she know that her ovulation cycle is predictable and healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002o3b6iavnh5p9c@published"&gt;The LW was likely told that the probability of natural pregnancy per menstrual cycle is around&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11585-conception"&gt; 25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s if she’s in her 20s and there are no other health impediments for her or her husband. This probability&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy"&gt; drops precipitously&lt;/a&gt; with age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002p3b6iio2t5ufx@published"&gt;This is not to discourage people who are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/rapamycin-fertility-ovarian-reserve-menopause-antiaging-skepticism.html"&gt;trying to conceive&lt;/a&gt;—I’m in that precipitously dropping probability group, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/fertility-cliff-advanced-maternal-age-outdated.html"&gt;thank goodness for modern medicine&lt;/a&gt;! But it is noticeable to me that she has gone through IVF and not had a successful pregnancy, so she has been educated on the small probabilities we’re dealing with, and the likelihood that even with the best medicine has to offer, it’s not going to happen. And she and her husband are still thinking there might be a good reason to try this plan, which has seemingly &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/mychart-patient-portal-fertility-journey-pregnancy-anxiety.html"&gt;infinite ways&lt;/a&gt; it can go wrong … and only one minuscule way it can go right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002q3b6idqprkep7@published"&gt;That either means there’s more going on here—as you suggested, maybe she or her husband is looking for an excuse for her to have sex with Manny. In that case, DO NOT get a child involved. But more worrying to me is the likelihood that she, her husband, or both have not really understood and processed the IVF failure. There is almost no reason to think she will get pregnant naturally from sleeping with Manny once. The fact that she or her husband think it’s that easy, despite everything they have already learned and experienced, means they need to spend time working through the disappointment and grief that come with accepting that biological children are not in their future. The effort to process, grieve, heal, and move forward as a family should be the focus—not cockamamie schemes that may only damage the marriage more and simply delay the pain of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

And you make a good point about the fact that they’ve already tried IVF. Sperm quality is definitely something they check out during that process, so the couple should really know definitively, beyond “it looks as though the doctors [who predicted that he wouldn’t be able to conceive when he was a child] were correct.” We have updated information! Anyway, I don’t want to get too far into the medical details, even though those of us who’ve been throughIVF should really have some kind of honorary degree in fertility medicine. Suffice it to say, the answer to “Could this really be the solution we’ve been looking for?” is “probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, romantic love can be important to some, but I only have one person in my life who loves me that way (my husband) and a dozen or more people who love me in a friendship way. I wonder if seeking out a chosen family might help fill this void. Perhaps you could start with fellow adoptees. There’s a lot of discussion about adopted children who went through exactly what you’ve experienced and I bet you would vibe with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought so too—and I just celebrated the 43rd anniversary of a marriage that is everything you are looking for. An older friend helped me, and I want to share the advice he gave me. I hope you will try it.&lt;/p&gt;

No detail is too small. Take your time—spend a week or more on it. When you can’t think of one more thing, go through the list and pick out the 10 or 12 most important items. Again, take your time and consider carefully. Once you have locked that down, order the list. Put the most important first, and write them out from first to last. Read it often. If you go out to a bar, read the list before you go. If you go on a weekend singles adventure, make it your purpose to open your heart and get to know everyone. My person was there all along—I just hadn’t noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32n00313b6ictzngd04@published"&gt;Remember, your person may not have every quality on the list, but your focus will attune your mind to recognize the one. This really, actually works. Do it, and then give it time.&lt;/p&gt;

But perhaps you could also remind the LW that her mother is a fully formed adult who still has desires and needs. No one wants to think of their parents as sexual beings (eww), but the LW seemed to give her dad a pass for his behavior while sort of condemning her mom for her new boobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel attractive at any age, and it’s not necessarily a sign of dementia. The LW should give some grace to her mom—and stay out of it with her sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

Why isn’t anyone concerned about the dad? They will be when he introduces them to a new stepmother who is draped in red flags. Meanwhile, the mom’s new boobs are hurting no &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing that really bothers me is that she’s jealous of people in our field who are successful. Anytime someone we know, or a random person that has a similar age to us, is remotely successful, she gets jealous. She’ll say things like “why isn’t that me” or just “ugh” and sigh. It’s making me more and more annoyed as time goes on and I notice it more. Of course, I also worry that she will direct that at me and I don’t need that in my life. I’ve been hesitant to tell her when I get job interviews or offers because I don’t know if she’s honest in her “congratulations!” &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/ratted-out-custodian-stealing-food-coworkers-hate-me-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;What do I do? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, a person can live as long a life as anyone else, despite having HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs were also invented to lower an HIV-negative person's risk of contracting the virus by 99%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, research has shown that ART can suppress HIV to such an extent that it makes the virus untransmittable to sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That has spurred a movement to downgrade the crime of infecting a person with HIV: it leaves the victim on life-long, costly medication, but it does not mean certain death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here is more about the new life-saving and preventative drugs: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium"&gt;1. Drugs for HIV-positive people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It suppresses their viral load so the virus is untransmittable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1996, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was discovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug, a triple combination, turned HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It suppresses the virus, preventing it from developing into AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which makes the body unable to withstand infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six months of religiously taking the daily pill, it suppresses the virus to such an extent that it's undetectable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And once a person's viral load is undetectable, they cannot transmit HIV to anyone else, according to scores of studies including a decade-long study by the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/undetectable-equals-untransmittable"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public health bodies around the world now acknowledge that U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium"&gt;2.

It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought "a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing" for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published "in due course".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'Dramatic results'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Although green social prescribing is designed to complement, not replace, conventional medical treatments and therapies, there are some who fear it does not deal with the bigger social health issues around mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Rob Poole, professor of social psychiatry at the Centre for Mental Health and Society, said that, while he was not against green social prescribing, it was an "inadequate response to the social determinants of health, such as poor housing, poverty and deterioration in social infrastructure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"These are not lifestyle choices. They cannot be addressed by time-limited interventions, no matter how much better green activity makes you feel in the short run," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Shannon Kang, an NHS health and wellbeing coach at the University Medical Practice in Birmingham, who has recently been trained in nature prescribing by the RSPB, said she had seen "dramatic results" - with patients' anxiety and stress levels reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Ms Hough, getting in touch with the natural world has been life-changing: "I was sceptical.

While topical minoxidil is an approved therapy, its limited ability to dissolve in water and penetrate the skin reduces its effectiveness. Researchers reporting in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt; have found that stevioside, a natural sweetener extracted from the Stevia plant, can help improve how well the drug is absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;&lt;p data-start="510" data-end="730"&gt;In tests using a mouse model of alopecia, a dissolvable patch containing both stevioside and minoxidil successfully stimulated hair follicles to re-enter the growth phase, which resulted in the development of new hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," said co-corresponding author Lifeng Kang, PhD, of the University of Sydney, in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Androgenetic alopecia develops gradually over time and is influenced by both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition occurs when hair follicles become increasingly sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone derived from testosterone. This sensitivity causes the follicles to shrink, leading to shorter and finer strands of hair until growth eventually stops. Although the pattern and progression differ between men and women, the biological mechanism is similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, treatment options are limited, with minoxidil being one of the few widely approved topical therapies. Minoxidil works by widening blood vessels and increasing blood flow around hair follicles, which can extend the growth phase of the hair cycle and stimulate new strands to develop. However, because the drug does not easily pass through the outer layer of skin and dissolves poorly in water, its full potential is often not realized. Patients must apply it consistently for several months before seeing results, and even then, the response varies from person to person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This challenge has driven researchers to explore new ways of improving how minoxidil is delivered to the scalp. Enhancing the drug’s skin permeability could make treatments more efficient, reduce application frequency, and possibly lower side effects related to overuse. The discovery that stevioside can act as a natural absorption enhancer offers a new direction for scientists seeking to improve both the safety and effectiveness of hair loss therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="a457f9eb-e90d-4ba7-9058-904917a0162a"&gt;Joint issues can range from mildly irritating to downright painful, making it difficult to move around and use your full range of motion without triggering soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the last thing you feel like doing when experiencing pain like this is to move around, it might help alleviate some of your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="a457f9eb-e90d-4ba7-9058-904917a0162a-2"&gt;“Dynamic stretching uses controlled, movement-based exercises that guide the joints and muscles through a gentle, full range of motion,” says Jill Drummond, Pilates instructor and director of programming and education at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bodybarpilates.com/" data-url="https://bodybarpilates.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BODYBAR Pilates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummond explains that joint pain can have a variety of causes, ranging from acute injury to chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some common causes include injury or overuse, degenerative or age-related changes, muscle weakness or imbalances, postural dysfunction and poor movement mechanics, sedentary lifestyles, or medical conditions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, if you do experience joint pain, gentle movement can often help. It can lubricate the joints, warm up the muscles, and stretch out any stiff areas that might be causing your pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching through mat Pilates is an excellent way to counter muscle weakness and imbalances, postural dysfunction and poor movement mechanics, and overcome a sedentary lifestyle,” explains Drummond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GYzvU36oViQoJuUznZ3hmS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GYzvU36oViQoJuUznZ3hmS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Drummond’s top five exercises to help with any joint pain you may be experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-dynamic-inner-thigh-and-it-band-circle-stretch" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-dynamic-inner-thigh-and-it-band-circle-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

							&lt;p data-start="339" data-end="395"&gt;Getting older doesn’t automatically mean slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="397" data-end="539"&gt;Sure, your body changes, but aging well isn’t about defying time—it’s about maintaining function, flexibility, and strength where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="541" data-end="731"&gt;And here’s the thing: when we talk about fitness after 60, most people focus on how much they can lift or how fast they can walk. But there’s a better measure—the quality of your movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="733" data-end="1022"&gt;If you’re 65 (or even approaching it) and can still do these eight movements, your body is performing far better than you might realize. These aren’t “gym exercises.” They’re the daily-life movements that reflect how well your muscles, joints, and nervous system are still communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1047" data-end="1108"&gt;1) You can squat down and get back up without holding on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1110" data-end="1209"&gt;This might seem basic, but it’s one of the strongest indicators of overall mobility and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1211" data-end="1458"&gt;Being able to squat to the ground and stand back up without grabbing onto a chair, countertop, or your knees means your glutes, quads, and core are still firing in harmony. Those muscles form your foundation—they keep you stable and independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1460" data-end="1637"&gt;Try it sometime. Lower yourself down slowly and rise back up without momentum. That smooth, controlled movement is proof that your brain and body are still a coordinated team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1639" data-end="1952"&gt;I once met a 72-year-old yoga teacher in Santa Cruz who could drop into a full deep squat and hold it while chatting like it was no big deal. When I asked her how she kept that ability, she said, “I never stopped doing it.” That’s it. You don’t preserve mobility by talking about it—you preserve it by using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2120"&gt;So if you can still squat comfortably, your joints are tracking well, your muscles are strong, and your nervous system is sharp. That’s not luck—that’s consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2127" data-end="2185"&gt;2) You can balance on one leg for at least 10 seconds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2187" data-end="2251"&gt;Balance might be the most underrated marker of physical youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2253" data-end="2391"&gt;Stand on one leg and count to ten. No wobbling, no touching down. If you can do that, you’re doing better than most people in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2393" data-end="2648"&gt;Why does this matter so much? Because balance is about more than not falling—it’s a direct reflection of your brain’s communication with your muscles and joints. It shows your reflexes and proprioception (your body’s sense of position) are still strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2650" data-end="2857"&gt;I remember watching older locals in Bali carry buckets of water barefoot across rocky paths without a single stumble. They weren’t gym-goers—they just used their bodies in balance-demanding ways every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2859" data-end="2985"&gt;So if you can still balance on one leg for a full ten seconds—or longer—you’re not just steady. You’re neurologically sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3159"&gt;And yes, you can train this at any age. Start by standing on one leg while brushing your teeth. Balance, like strength, is a skill that responds beautifully to attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3166" data-end="3228"&gt;3) You can get up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3282"&gt;This one might be the truest test of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3284" data-end="3495"&gt;If you can sit down on the floor and get back up again without using your hands, knees, or furniture for support, your body’s doing great. It means your core, hips, and coordination are still working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3497" data-end="3792"&gt;There’s real research behind it. In a study of over 2,000 adults aged 51–80, those able to &lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/srff/deBrito-Floor-Rise-Mortality-2012..pdf?.com"&gt;“sit and rise”&lt;/a&gt; with minimal support had significantly lower mortality risk over the subsequent years.  Sounds dramatic—but it makes sense. Mobility and survival are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3794" data-end="3956"&gt;I’ve seen people half that age struggle to stand up from a seated position without using their hands. It’s not about fitness level—it’s about movement literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3958" data-end="4079"&gt;If you can do this, it’s not just your muscles thanking you—it’s your nervous system, your joints, and your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4086" data-end="4129"&gt;4) You can reach overhead without pain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4131" data-end="4196"&gt;Shoulder mobility tells a lot about how well your body’s aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4198" data-end="4373"&gt;Being able to lift your arms straight overhead—without arching your back, shrugging your shoulders, or wincing—shows that your joints and connective tissue are still supple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4375" data-end="4602"&gt;If that movement feels easy, it means you’re keeping good posture, maintaining shoulder rotation, and preserving functional range. That’s crucial, because the shoulder is one of the most injury-prone joints in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4604" data-end="4777"&gt;Think about it: every time you hang up clothes, grab something from a high shelf, or put on a jacket, you’re using that range. Lose it, and everyday life starts to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4779" data-end="4970"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another post: strength and flexibility aren’t opposites—they’re partners. A mobile shoulder doesn’t just help you move—it helps you move powerfully and safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4972" data-end="5085"&gt;So if you can still raise your arms easily overhead, you’ve held onto something priceless: freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5092" data-end="5157"&gt;5) You can walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5159" data-end="5229"&gt;Forget treadmills for a second—stairs are the real-life stress test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5231" data-end="5437"&gt;If you can climb a flight (or two) without gasping for air or clutching the railing, your cardiovascular system is in great shape. It means your lungs, heart, and muscles are working efficiently together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5439" data-end="5704"&gt;When I hike the Griffith Observatory trail in Los Angeles, I sometimes spot groups of older walkers cruising up the incline while chatting like it’s nothing. They’re not “fitness freaks.” They’re just consistent movers who’ve built endurance into their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5706" data-end="5922"&gt;Cardio health is less about how fast you go and more about how easily your body handles effort. If you can recover quickly after climbing stairs—heart rate settles, breathing evens out—you’re doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5924" data-end="6078"&gt;The truth is, stamina fades only when we stop using it. If you can still walk up stairs with ease at 65, you’re outpacing a lot of people half your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6085" data-end="6116"&gt;6) You can touch your toes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6118" data-end="6146"&gt;Simple test, deep meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6148" data-end="6441"&gt;If you can still bend forward and touch your toes without straining or pain, it means your hamstrings, hips, and lower back are staying flexible and cooperative. That’s a big deal, because flexibility isn’t just about movement—it’s about how well your body circulates blood and moves energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6443" data-end="6619"&gt;When your muscles shorten or tighten over time, your whole system starts working harder to compensate. You might notice more back stiffness, shorter strides, even poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6621" data-end="6863"&gt;During the pandemic, I started a daily stretch routine—nothing fancy, just 10 minutes in the morning—and the difference was incredible. Not just in how I moved, but in how I felt. Stretching isn’t about being bendy—it’s about feeling awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6865" data-end="7008"&gt;So if you can still fold forward and reach those toes, your body’s elasticity is alive and well. You’re keeping your connective tissue young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7015" data-end="7071"&gt;7) You can twist and look over your shoulder easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7073" data-end="7168"&gt;This one’s often overlooked, but it might be one of the clearest signs of a well-aging spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7170" data-end="7364"&gt;The ability to rotate your torso smoothly—without pain, stiffness, or awkward compensation—shows that your spine is still hydrated, your muscles are balanced, and your nerves are unrestricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7366" data-end="7567"&gt;Think about how often you use rotation in daily life: reversing a car, swinging your arm, reaching behind you. Most people lose that ability because they stop using it, not because they’re “too old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7569" data-end="7743"&gt;A physical therapist once told me, “The spine rewards movement.” That line stuck with me. Movement nourishes your spinal discs by keeping them flexible and fed with oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7745" data-end="7942"&gt;If you can still twist easily to look behind you, you’re preserving one of the most vital aspects of mobility—spinal health. It’s also a quiet signal that your nervous system is aging gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7949" data-end="7997"&gt;8) You can carry your groceries in one trip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7999" data-end="8053"&gt;Okay, I’ll admit—this is one of my favorite “tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8055" data-end="8256"&gt;If you can grab a few grocery bags and make it from your car to the kitchen without stopping, your grip, shoulders, and core are in solid shape. That’s functional strength—the kind you use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8258" data-end="8495"&gt;Grip strength, in particular, is one of the best predictors of healthy aging. Studies consistently show that people with stronger grips tend to live longer, experience fewer health complications, and maintain better cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8497" data-end="8605"&gt;It’s not just about having big muscles. It’s about how efficiently your body generates and sustains force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8607" data-end="8863"&gt;I’ve noticed this when traveling in places like Japan and Portugal—older people walking home with shopping bags or carrying water bottles uphill. They’re not training for it; it’s simply part of life. And that lifestyle naturally keeps their strength up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8865" data-end="8996"&gt;If you can still do your grocery haul in one go, you’re not just saving time—you’re showing off solid endurance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9003" data-end="9040"&gt;The quiet truth about aging well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9042" data-end="9141"&gt;Here’s the thing most people get wrong about aging: it’s not a steady decline—it’s a negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9143" data-end="9273"&gt;Yes, you lose some muscle mass and flexibility with time. But how &lt;em data-start="9209" data-end="9215"&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; that happens depends on your habits, not your birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9275" data-end="9439"&gt;These eight movements aren’t about athletic performance or competition. They’re about your ability to live well—to move through your day with confidence and ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9441" data-end="9684"&gt;People who age well usually share one mindset: they stay curious about what their bodies can do. They don’t stop squatting, balancing, stretching, or walking. They make movement part of daily life instead of something to “fit in” at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9686" data-end="9767"&gt;And when they notice something getting harder, they don’t surrender—they adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9769" data-end="9852"&gt;Aging gracefully isn’t about denying time; it’s about using what you have wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9859" data-end="9879"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9881" data-end="9971"&gt;If you can still perform these movements at 65, your body’s doing better than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9973" data-end="10076"&gt;You’ve maintained strength, flexibility, and control in a world that constantly encourages stillness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10078" data-end="10233"&gt;And if you can’t do them &lt;em data-start="10103" data-end="10108"&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, don’t stress. The beauty of the human body is that it’s responsive. It learns, it rebuilds, it adapts—no matter your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10235" data-end="10323"&gt;Start small. Stretch in the mornings. Take the stairs. Practice getting off the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10325" data-end="10410"&gt;Because aging well isn’t about turning back the clock—it’s about staying in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10412" data-end="10474"&gt;Your body’s still listening. Keep giving it something to do.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

Your hair keeps growing just fine, but the color fades thanks to the cells in the hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That switch doesn’t happen because your whole body suddenly “gets old.” It starts inside each follicle, where pigment stem cells are supposed to leave their safe zone, catch a cue, and become the color-making melanocytes that dye each new strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those cells, known as melanocyte stem cells (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459091000651X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McSCs&lt;/a&gt;) stop moving on schedule, the color step gets skipped – even though the hair still grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to our basic understanding of how melanocyte stem cells work to color hair,” said study lead investigator Qi Sun, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The newfound mechanisms raise the possibility that the same fixed positioning of melanocyte stem cells may exist in humans. If so, it presents a potential pathway for reversing or preventing the graying of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-natural-cure-male-baldness-highly-effective-sugar-2-deoxy-d-ribose/"&gt;human hair&lt;/a&gt; by helping jammed cells to move again between developing hair follicle compartments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follicle-cells-and-gray-hair"&gt;Follicle cells and gray hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a follicle, two neighborhoods matter most for color. The hair germ sends out strong chemical messages that tell pigment stem cells to mature into melanocytes. The bulge is a safer hangout with no “make color now” message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy cycle, stem cells travel from the bulge into the hair germ right as a new hair begins. Next, they hear the signals from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/wnt-protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WNT proteins&lt;/a&gt;, then shift into McSCs, and load pigment into the growing shaft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, some of the cells that produce gray hairs will reset to a stem-like state for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers watched this in action rather than guessing from snapshots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using long-term live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing across multiple growth cycles in mouse follicles, they tracked where individual cells were and what instructions they were reading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regrowth was repeatedly forced, more pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; lingered in the bulge, missed the WNT-rich zone, matured less often, and gray hairs increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of the gray hair follicle cells led to a signal, the signal led to a decision, and that decision led to the hair’s color – or to gray when that chain broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-location-movement-and-timing"&gt;Location, movement, and timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That process completely reframes how we think about follicle cells and graying hair. Time matters, but not like a countdown clock that drains color. Movement and timing matter more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigment stem cells have to make the trip at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the loss of chameleon-like function in melanocyte stem cells that may be responsible for graying and loss of hair color,” said study senior investigator &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/mayumi-ito-suzuki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayumi Ito, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/dermatology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/cell-biology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lose that chameleon behavior – arriving in the right neighborhood when the cue is loud – and you can still grow healthy hair shafts that emerge silver because the dye step never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-on-gray-hair-cell-study"&gt;Limitations on gray hair cell study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful to point out that there were limitations to what could be proven in this study. Stress isn’t a single switch that turns hair gray for good, and simply flipping stem cells “on” won’t fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gray hair follicle cells can be present and still fail if they never reach the signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future approach would need to help them move on time or make the hair germ more inviting, not just blast the whole follicle with a random growth command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might ask how this maps to people, since the experiments used mice. Human follicles share the same architecture and cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this fact, two separate paths make sense to explore in greater detail: restore the commute so pigment stem cells reach the hair germ right when a new hair starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, tune the local cues so that, once there, cells clearly hear the message to become McSCs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing and restraint would be critical. Push too many cells to mature at once and you could drain the reserve; push too few and nothing changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixing-gray-hair-cells-in-the-real-world"&gt;Fixing gray hair cells in the real world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t a permanent “color” switch – it’s to keep the rhythm going so some cells color the hair now while others reset for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this fits a simple idea: cells read their surroundings before they act. DNA provides options; the neighborhood tells them which option to pick today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gray hair follicles, neighborhoods shift across time and space. When pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cells-can-shift-from-hair-growth-to-skin-healing/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; reach the right spot at the right moment, they catch the message, become melanocytes, and color the strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When movement or timing fail, the message is lost and the hair grows in gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no treatment yet – this is just a map, not a medicine. However, scientists do believe they’re getting very close to a real-world solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-scientists"&gt;Next steps for scientists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future studies in people confirm the same pattern, scientists can test gentle ways to ease the traffic – nudging cells out of the bulge or strengthening the hair germ’s signals – without derailing the rest of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to protect flexibility. They must mature enough cells to color the hair you’re growing now, and keep enough in reserve so the system still works years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you spot a gray strand, remember that your hair didn’t forget how to grow. The factory is fine; it’s the commute inside the follicle that jammed. Fix the traffic and, in theory, color could return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, gray doesn’t have to mean weak or unhealthy hair. It can mean the pigment team missed its cue – and that turns gray from a mystery into a timing problem science is learning how to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05960-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 01:42:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTmRaUy1qS2RHTjZjbTRQNl9yRko0TU9MOEhVNldKS1ZOekhINjZfdkswUzBLdVVlZWg2empDSi1IUF9HLXRvQXN3aERVVFZORkR2bHoya1d2NWdfajJHYXZWN05HNDFHZnlhZWs3OGxoZGtMYTVMNEo5RzRLY0JlelRqM3NwaW03UjFidjlKN3BtQmJISWFPWmFvbDAzbFBjaXVTN1ltN0Y</guid></item><item><title>专家说，治疗关节疼痛的最佳药物不是你想的那样- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-medicine-for-joint-pain-isnt-what-you-think-expert-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older. But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERRYVILLE, Mo. — A morning DJ at a classic rock station servicing parts of the St. Louis area died after contracting the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/missouri-west-nile-virus-leaves-3-dead-15-hospitalized-mosquitos/63-d5b229dc-b920-4c01-824e-acadcb39ac21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile Virus,&lt;/a&gt; according to the station he worked at.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, Classic Rock 93.1 KBDZ said that Kevin "Kevy Kev" Russell died Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"About five weeks ago, it seems Kevin contracted the West Nile Virus. He had a fever he couldn't get rid of, so when his temperature spiked and stayed there, he was admitted to the hospital," the station said. "His condition deteriorated and it became obvious after a while, he was not going to get better again."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell was also the general manager for the station based out of Perryville. The station said Russell was a beloved leader and was a key part of day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For this small staff, this has been one of the most brutal things we have ever been through. Kevin basically built this station in the basement of his house and is responsible for ALL of the technical aspects of the station. That's why we've had so much trouble lately," the station said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio sportscaster Paul Brown also &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/paulbrownmedia/posts/pfbid02yfSzybej2QASi3m4bzn2UMmvcTWRUmgDqsP7zXwabuCBJfgr4Z2CnJicATXVVCAGl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;gave a tribute to Russell&lt;/a&gt; on social media; Brown said he first met him in the 80s when they were early on in their broadcast careers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fast forward to this spring. Kevin had the idea to bring high school football games to the radio in St Charles on 101.7FM. He asked me to do the play by play.  So nearly 45 years after our first gig together, Kevin and me became colleagues once again," Brown said. "He worked tirelessly getting the station and me ready for the broadcasts. I was unsure of myself after so many years between broadcasting games but Kevin reassured me and made me realize it was “just like riding a bicycle.” He was right and I’m having more fun doing radio now than ever."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the Missouri Department of Public Health and Senior Services said that the West Nile virus has been spreading faster in the state than usual. It said as of Oct. 4, three people died and 15 people were hospitalized from the Mosquito-borne virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

They tracked 54 women aged 18 to 40 not using hormone-based contraception and grouped them according to how much exercise they took: inactive (reported not taking part in any form of structured exercise), recreationally active (taking part in at least two hours of structured exercise a week), competing in any sport at club level, and elite (competing in any sport at national or international level).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They then completed cognitive tests and reported their mood and symptoms on the first day of menstruation, two days after the end of menstruation (late follicular phase), the first day ovulation was detected, and between ovulation and menstruation (mid-luteal phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in Sports Medicine – Open, found that women perform best on cognitive tests when they ovulate, with on average participants reacting about 30 milliseconds faster compared with later in their cycle and making fewer mistakes. But for elite athletes, the difference in performance was much more pronounced. On average, their attention and inhibition scores were more than 120 milliseconds faster, and their simple reaction time was 80 milliseconds faster at ovulation than the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Flaminia Ronca, the lead author of the study from UCL Surgery and Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said: “At an elite level, 80 milliseconds slower reaction times makes a big difference and in a fast-paced sport like rugby, it could put you at greater risk of concussion or serious musculoskeletal injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the other end of the exercise spectrum, the authors also found that compared with active participants (at whatever level), inactive participants had reaction times on average about 70 milliseconds slower and made about three times as many impulsive errors, regardless of cycle phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This difference could determine whether we regain balance after tripping over an obstacle or not, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows the importance of incorporating some form of recreational physical activity into our lives,” Ronca said. “It doesn’t have to be that intense or competitive to make a difference – and crucially, it’s something that we can control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/women" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt; in Sport said: “While it is fascinating to understand the tiny cognitive supercharging that happens the day of ovulation, the most interesting conclusion is around the cognitive benefits of being active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having the time to register and respond to a risk is the difference between having a fall or righting yourself. For women in wiser life, avoiding falls is especially vital given the huge gendered health inequality around osteoporosis with one in two women over 50 suffering from this, compared to one in nine men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We already knew being active can build bone strength and now we know being active can increase our response times. This report adds a second layer of urgency to get women active and address the tragedy and cost of fragility fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORVdKS09Xem83V0lES2x6X0pZNTdMWktNaEtacFpUT1FmZ21HM2NMRF9idXUtQ2ZRbUJSUkZocnRUSXpqWWZMWHNJN3pBcXhMV2t0bVd3WHdFa2tCbWY5TWFKZ3VCdzVOZUpKaEtXUlRaTGRIWUV3ZGh1bVgxOVg4UGNGMURTbWJZWFQ0SXB5SXJObmpUVVhvcmRoM2Q2Q1VhS1RqdzRn</guid></item><item><title>加州大学在3天内赢得5项诺贝尔奖—并创下新的世界纪录-加州大学</title><link>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-wins-5-nobel-prizes-3-days-and-sets-new-world-record</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s scientific leadership faces unprecedented threats &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet now the very system that has powered decades of world-changing scientific discovery, here at UC and in thousands of academic and government labs across the country, is at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, the federal government has canceled or delayed thousands of research grants to hundreds of U.S. universities. While funding for many of UC’s projects has been restored, the interruptions and uncertainty have plagued research that is poised to deliver vital new knowledge, including studies of aging, addiction, obesity, maternal and fetal health and Alzheimer’s disease. And the federal government is considering further cuts to science funding in its budget for the coming year. This year, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress calling for deep cuts to federal science agencies — in some cases by up to half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is going to cripple science, and it is going to be disastrous if this continues,” said Clarke in an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW147207102025RP1/?chan=science&amp;amp;location=channel-item"&gt;interview this week&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of what Congress decides about the coming year’s budget, the disruptions that government and academic labs have already experienced will reverberate for a long time. “It may take a decade to get back to where we were, say, half a year ago,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You unconsciously relax&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When you see green trees, smell pine and hear gentle rustling leaves or the sound of birdsong, your autonomic nervous system - a network of nerves controlling unconscious processes - responds instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This can happen on a visit to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see changes in the body such as a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate variability so your heart beats slower," says Baroness Kathy Willis, a biodiversity professor at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44097-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;A UK study&lt;/a&gt;, involving nearly 20,000 people, found that those who spent at least a total of 120 minutes every week in greenery were significantly more likely to report good health and higher psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The evidence for the benefits of spending time in nature is compelling enough that some areas have trialled so called green social prescribing connecting people with nature to improve their phsyical and mental health, with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/green-social-prescribing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;positive impact on happiness and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;2. Your hormones reboot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Willis says that spending time outdoors lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a big increase in natural killer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body.

          &lt;p&gt;An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;October 22 and 23&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is tasked with publicly reviewing and evaluating the wealth of safety and efficacy data on vaccines and then offering evidence-based recommendations for their use. Once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the CDC, they set national vaccination standards for children and establish which shots federal programs and private insurance companies are required to fully cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the committee has been stacked with highly esteemed, thoroughly vetted medical experts, who diligently conducted their somewhat esoteric work on immunization policy with little fanfare. That changed when ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary. In June, Kennedy abruptly and unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, falsely accusing them of being riddled with conflicts of interest. He then installed his own hand-selected members. With the exception of one advisor—pediatrician and veteran ACIP member Cody Meissner—the members are poorly qualified, have gone through little vetting, and embrace the same anti-vaccine and dangerous fringe ideas as Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corrupted committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Kennedy's advisors have met twice, producing chaotic meetings during which members revealed a clear lack of understanding of the data at hand and the process of setting vaccine recommendations, all while setting policy decisions long sought by anti-vaccine activists. The first meeting, in June, included seven members selected by Kennedy. In that meeting, the committee rescinded the recommendation for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/"&gt;flu vaccines containing a preservative called thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; based on false claims from anti-vaccine groups that it causes autism. The panel also ominously said it would re-evaluate the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-childhood-vaccines-in-question-after-first-meeting-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel/"&gt;entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;, putting life-saving shots at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) are alerting the public to the first known occurrence of the Asian longhorned tick (ALHT) in Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;KDHE said it identified the tick after it was found on a dog in Franklin County last week.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The health department said it’s an exotic, invasive tick species that was first identified in the United States in 2017. Since then, it has spread westward across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="kvjhyvwn" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/ticks/asian-longhorned/asian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tick has now been documented in 21 states, with Kansas being the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="kvjhyvwn" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“We have been monitoring the spread of the Asian longhorned tick, especially since it was confirmed in neighboring states,” Animal Health Commissioner Dr. Justin Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now that it has been identified in Kansas, we have been in contact with accredited veterinarians across the state to remind them to be alert for this tick and to ensure they understand the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This tick, which can reproduce without the need for a male tick, has both human and animal health implications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, an ALHT in Virginia was found to be infected with Bourbon virus, while Connecticut recently identified an ALHT infected with ehrlichiosis, both of which are tick-borne diseases that occur in Kansas but are currently transmitted by the Lone Star tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re still learning about this tick and the ecologic role that it currently plays and may play in the future in terms of disease transmission to humans,” said Dr. Erin Petro, KDHE state public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While the human health implications are uncertain, this tick has serious implications for animal health.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The tick can cause extreme infestations on affected animals, sometimes leading to severe anemia or even exsanguination. Beyond the physical threat, the ALHT also transmits the cattle parasite &lt;em&gt;Theileria orientalis &lt;/em&gt;Ikeda strain, which causes &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/bovine-theileriosis-infosheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bovine theileriosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, KDHE piloted a program to create a passive tick surveillance network of veterinary clinics throughout the state. Through this program, participating clinics submit tick samples from animals in their care to KDHE for identification. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these partners submitted a routine sample, which was later identified as ALHT and confirmed by the USDA. In both humans and animals, tick bite prevention is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of disease, follow these precautions:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of where ticks are found and use preventive measures when in grassy, brushy, or wooded areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dress preventively by wearing long pants tucked into socks and a shirt tucked into pants.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treat clothing and gear with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-approved repellent such as DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) when enjoying the outdoors or being in a tick habitat.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;After coming indoors, perform a thorough tick check, being sure to focus on the waistband, under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of knees, and in and around the hair.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check pets for ticks, especially around the tail, between the back legs, under the front legs, between the toes, in and around the ears, around the eyes, and under the collar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shower soon after being in a tick habitat or engaging in outdoor activities. This will help remove any unattached ticks and identify any attached ticks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To remove attached ticks, use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers, grasp the tick near the skin, and apply gentle traction straight outwards until the tick is removed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Help prevent tick-borne diseases and tick infestations on pets by consulting with your veterinarian on the use of a veterinary-approved flea and tick preventative.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We're constantly told to "eat healthy" – but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They're part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That's flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don't qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even "elevated" blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png" alt="Tea in a cup next to berries and chocolate" class="size-full wp-image-167409" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-415x415.png 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating certain foods could help support your heart health. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-tea-setting-with-strawberries-and-chocolates-31583807/"&gt;İclâl Ağlamaz/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea, one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it's making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177076" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren't a magic fix. They won't replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike many health fads, this isn't about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It's about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256631/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

KDHE identified the ALHT after it was found on a dog in Franklin County last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALHT is an exotic, invasive tick species that was first identified in the United States in New Jersey in 2017. Since then, it has spread westward across the U.S. and, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has now been documented in 21 states, with Kansas being the most recent (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.aphis.usda.gov%2Flivestock-poultry-disease%2Fcattle%2Fticks%2Fasian-longhorned%2Fasian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/01000199cac168d2-511d7d78-8fcf-4926-9f35-8404a784e5a7-000000/n3sreE3O3CqMqPwSQzV0ifE1ZMHF1lXeivAtOq4Z1O0=426"&gt;https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/ticks/asian-longhorned/asian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been monitoring the spread of the Asian longhorned tick, especially since it was confirmed in neighboring states,” Animal Health Commissioner Dr. Justin Smith said. “Now that it has been identified in Kansas, we have been in contact with accredited veterinarians across the state to remind them to be alert for this tick and to ensure they understand the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prolific tick, which can reproduce without the need for a male tick, has both human and animal health implications. In 2019, an ALHT in Virginia was found to be infected with Bourbon virus, while Connecticut recently identified an ALHT infected with ehrlichiosis, both of which are tick-borne diseases that occur in Kansas but are currently transmitted by the Lone Star tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still learning about this tick and the ecologic role that it currently plays and may play in the future in terms of disease transmission to humans.” Dr. Erin Petro, KDHE State Public Health Veterinarian, said. “While the human health implications are uncertain, this tick has serious implications for animal health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ALHT can cause extreme infestations on affected animals, sometimes leading to severe anemia or even exsanguination. Beyond the physical threat, the ALHT also transmits the cattle parasite Theileria orientalis Ikeda strain, which causes bovine theileriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, KDHE piloted a program to create a passive tick surveillance network of veterinary clinics throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this program, participating clinics submit tick samples from animals in their care to KDHE for identification. This program has been successful in providing information on where various ticks are found across the state and has been especially useful in under-surveyed areas. One of these partners submitted a routine sample which was later identified as ALHT by KDHE and confirmed by the USDA. In both humans and animals, tick bite prevention is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To reduce the risk of disease, follow these precautions:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Be aware of where ticks are found and using preventive measures when in grassy, brushy, or wooded areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Dress preventively by wearing long pants tucked into socks and shirt tucked into pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Treat clothing and gear with permethrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Use an EPA-approved repellent such as DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) when enjoying the outdoors or being in a tick habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- After coming indoors, perform a thorough tick check, being sure to focus on the waistband, under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of knees, and in and around the hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Check pets for ticks, especially around the tail, between the back legs, under the front legs, between the toes, in and around the ears, around the eyes, and under the collar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Shower soon after being in a tick habitat or engaging in outdoor activities. This will help remove any unattached ticks and identify any attached ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- To remove attached ticks, use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers, grasp the tick near the skin, and apply gentle traction strait outwards until the tick is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Help prevent tick-borne diseases and tick infestations on pets by consulting with your veterinarian on use of a veterinary-approved flea and tick preventative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- More information on tick bite prevention and controlling ticks in your environment can be found at Preventing Tick Bites | Ticks | CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the Asian longhorned tick including where it has been found in the US, visit the USDA Longhorned Tick Story Map at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.aphis.usda.gov%2Flivestock-poultry-disease%2Fcattle%2Fticks%2Fasian-longhorned%2Fasian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/2/01000199cac168d2-511d7d78-8fcf-4926-9f35-8404a784e5a7-000000/NTL2ETwqMrMYj5BcSSx5_NcVC4iyExMUyVOp7ljMXE4=426"&gt;https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/ticks/asian-longhorned/asian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find more information on other ticks, their geographic distributions, and the diseases they transmit in Kansas, visit KDHE’s Tickborne Disease Data Stories at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fmaps.kdhe.state.ks.us%2Fkstbdhome%2F%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/01000199cac168d2-511d7d78-8fcf-4926-9f35-8404a784e5a7-000000/vpOQVYYh4Yz7mDdF3KJsp4lQJZB9iYcSd61azyk8vdY=426"&gt;https://maps.kdhe.state.ks.us/kstbdhome/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Salina Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:19:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9vZ3JVS2ZVMWprMHd0V1o4V3BhcnN3ZXpLM19lTGtRbERuc1hndkpZc2pXVS1oQkdiYmpvUFR2eU5uVTc0X3dNN1N2NWxveWpNU2E2bHJrZ3NoX01DYnFGY2E1T3VqU1ppT2hoY3FfbEZVaFk</guid></item><item><title>塞内加尔在罕见的裂谷热大爆发中记录了17人死亡-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/senegal-rift-valley-fever-outbreak-d749c04910cb6bc5d8ed69b85e70f7c9</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has recorded 17 deaths from Rift Valley Fever, RVF, a health ministry official said Thursday, in a rare major outbreak of the viral disease in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 119 cases reported so far, mostly in northern Senegal’s livestock-producing region, the outbreak is raising concerns about further spread, said Dr. Boly Diop, head of RVF surveillance at the health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time Senegal has counted so many people affected,” Diop told local media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RVF is a viral disease that mainly affects livestock. Humans typically become infected through mosquito bites or contact with infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most human cases are mild or show no symptoms, severe cases can cause eye damage, brain swelling or hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal, according to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmission to humans usually occurs during slaughter, births or veterinary work, putting herders, farmers and slaughterhouse workers at a higher risk, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak in Senegal was declared on Sept. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senegal’s last major outbreak dates back to the late 1980s, when it killed more than 200 people in the country and neighboring Mauritania.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RVF outbreaks have also previously occurred in other African countries, including in Kenya and Somalia in 1998 when it killed over 470 people. In 2000, the virus spread to Saudi Arabia and Yemen — its first cases outside Africa — killing over 200 people and raising concerns of wider spread to Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Preventing animal outbreaks through vaccination and reducing mosquito exposure are key to controlling the disease, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RVF has been endemic in northern Senegal since the 1980s and is becoming more frequent across Africa due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. Merawi Aragaw Tegegne, an epidemiologist with the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you see torrential rain with quick floods, then sunny days, expect RVF in the coming days with favorable conditions for the vectors,” Tegegne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press reporter Babacar Dione contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP’s Africa coverage at: &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/africa"&gt;https://apnews.com/hub/africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, a recent review found that doing so could lead to a life-threatening stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review — published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675725001159" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Emergency Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Emergency Medicine&lt;/a&gt; — analyzed 22 studies documenting 54 cases of beauty parlor stroke syndrome over nearly five decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beauty parlor stroke syndrome (BPSS) refers to the hyperextension that occurs when tilting the head back into a salon shampoo bowl, which can compress or tear the vertebral arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain. In rare instances, this posture can lead to a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that most affected patients, roughly 80%, were women, with ages ranging from teenagers to seniors. They said symptoms of BPSS include dizziness or vertigo, blurred vision, loss of balance, headache, nausea or vomiting, slurred speech, sudden paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically appear during or within several days of the neck being in the triggering position, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Woman getting her hair washed at a salon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within the panorama of neurological urgencies, BPSS stands out not only for its unique etiology but also for the commonplace nature of its trigger — neck hyperextension during salon hair washes,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Elizabeth Smith suffered BPSS in 2014, nearly two weeks after getting her hair done when her neck was "hyper-extended" and resulted in a stroke that has had lasting consequences. She claimed that the hyperextension led her vertebrate to "cut her vertebral artery." The report said Smith has an "unsteady gait and loss of motor skills in her left hand" in addition to impairment in her left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I go to sleep wondering, will I wake up tomorrow?" she said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts note that BPSS is uncommon and largely known from isolated case reports rather than population data. However, some states require precautions to be taken to ensure safety due to the severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro Beauty Association in Arizona advises stylists to provide neck support like rolled towels or cushions, and to allow clients to sit more upright during washes, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rare-neck-condition-could-turn-salon-hair-washing-dangerous-stroke-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fox News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, clients are urged to speak up immediately if they are uncomfortable or experiencing any symptoms like neck strain or dizziness during services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/salon-hair-washing-can-trigger-deadly-stroke-11827425" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 20:05:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQcVU5SVo4YU5UTEZmSDdkNjlqUlpraS1CMXVzd0g4ZS1YcjFUNUJlY0dpTF9EWUxyejlRaXM3bDh0LWE4LU9Ncmw4MHc1UkhpWVNPSHY5S3pIT0QtZkM1LVlsLTVwSDF6TEVfYURtNTJBUndDRjRqVWJsZFdjX1ZvODRxVQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心小组宣布评估儿童疫苗的计划- Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/09/cdc-panel-to-assess-childhood-vaccine-schedule-00600304</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:58:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQTkhIdHBlbC1KYndCRERZUGZNdk9OOFlGVmppUnZUOW5RYU9ONmliTm5adVJpdTl6U0oyaVhwSjF0Yjk2d2EyellscW9pYjE1N0hrYWQ5MHdLbXNYWE1yUW9VQTlyNHROMmRKM1BLRzI1djgxMGF0U0kxWDdVTmFqd1FWaE5IaExIRjduUjBLSGRZN01rUEZpZ3g5LXo</guid></item><item><title>事实核查：特朗普在内阁会议上提出了许多虚假主张，其中许多是关于疫苗的- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/fact-check-trump-cabinet-meeting</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            “Regarding vaccines: some Amish choose to vaccinate their kids and some do not.

We do not know how its frequency compares to non-Amish.”

These include metals such as iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt and copper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most of these trace elements, decades of research have shown they are genuinely essential for health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for carrying oxygen in your blood, and many proteins – complex molecules that carry out all of the functions necessary for life – require iron to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deficiency of iron leads to anemia, a condition that results in fatigue, weakness, headaches and brittle nails, among other symptoms. Iron supplements can help reverse these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A panel of experts had previously recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, biochemists have pinpointed exactly how iron helps proteins perform essential chemical reactions, not just for humans but all living organisms. Researchers know not only that iron is essential but also why it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the same cannot be said for chromium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chromium deficiency – having little to no chromium in your body – is extremely rare, and researchers have not identified any clearly defined disease caused by low chromium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like all food, essential metals must be absorbed by your digestive system. However, the gut absorbs only about 1 percent of ingested chromium. Other essential metals are absorbed more efficiently – for example, the average person absorbs around 25 percent of certain forms of ingested iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite many studies, scientists have yet to find any protein that requires chromium to carry out its biological function. Only one protein is known to bind to chromium, and this protein most likely helps your kidneys remove the metal from your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies in people suggest chromium might be involved to some degree in regulating blood glucose levels, research on whether adding extra chromium to your body through supplements can substantially improve your body's ability to break down and use sugar has been inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, based on biochemistry, there is currently no evidence that humans, or other animals, actually require chromium for any particular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium might be essential for health stems from studies in the 1950s, a time when nutritionists knew very little about what trace metals are required to maintain good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One influential study involved feeding lab rats a diet that induced symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplementing their diet with chromium seemed to cure the rats of Type 2 diabetes, and medical researchers were enticed by the suggestion that chromium might provide a treatment for this disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today's widespread claims that chromium is important for regulating blood sugar can be traced to these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, these early experiments were very flawed by today's standards. They lacked the statistical analyses needed to show that their results were not due to random chance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, they lacked important controls, including measuring how much chromium was in the rats' diet to start with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later studies that were more rigorously designed provided ambiguous results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some found that rats fed chromium supplements controlled their blood sugar slightly better than rats raised on a chromium-free diet, others found no significant differences. But what was clear was that rats raised on diets that excluded chromium were perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments on people are much harder to control for than experiments on rats, and there are few well-designed clinical trials investigating the effects of chromium on patients with diabetes. Just as with the rat studies, the results are ambiguous. If there is an effect, it is very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, there has been a recommended dietary intake for chromium despite its lack of documented health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium is needed for health persists due in large part to a 2001 report from the National Institute of Medicine's Panel on Micronutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This panel of nutritional researchers and clinicians was formed to evaluate available research on human nutrition and set 'adequate intake' levels of vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their recommendations form the basis of the recommended daily intake labels found on food and vitamin packaging and the NIH guidelines for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite acknowledging the lack of research demonstrating clear-cut health benefits for chromium, the panel still recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This recommendation was not based on science but rather on previous estimates of how much chromium adult Americans already ingest each day. Notably, much of this chromium is leached from stainless steel cookware and food processing equipment, rather than coming from our food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, while there may not be confirmed health risks from taking chromium supplements, there's probably no benefit either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

The lead compound, K102, not only promotes remyelination but also balances immune function—key for long-term neurological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal and cell studies, it restored myelin-producing cells and showed strong potential for translation to human therapies. Now being developed by Cadenza Bio, this discovery could lead to the first therapy that helps regenerate, not just protect, nerve fibers in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring Myelin:&lt;/strong&gt; K102 and K110 both promote myelin repair, with K102 emerging as the strongest candidate for treating MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Action:&lt;/strong&gt; K102 restores damaged axons while also modulating immune function, a balance crucial for MS management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Clinical Trials:&lt;/strong&gt; The compounds are now moving toward human testing as part of a biotech-led translational program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting more than 2.9 million people worldwide. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, the protective insulation around nerve fibers, causing disruption of nerve signals between the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include numbness, tingling, vision loss, and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While current treatments can reduce inflammation, no therapies yet exist to protect neurons or restore the damaged myelin sheath. Researchers have now taken a major step forward in the development of such a therapy, supported by funding from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. They have identified two compounds that could remyelinate damaged axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, the research, led by Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine, and John Katzenellenbogen, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, or UIUC, was made possible through two National MS Society funding programs: a traditional investigator-initiated grant and the Society’s Fast Forward commercial accelerator program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work represents more than a decade of collaboration, with the last four years focused on identifying and optimizing new drug candidates that show strong potential to treat MS and possibly other neurological diseases involving demyelination,” Tiwari-Woodruff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the funding, the researchers were able to launch a program that was licensed by Cadenza Bio, Inc. With subsequent investor financing, Cadenza Bio has supported continued development of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is now advancing toward clinical evaluation as a potential first-in-class therapy for people living with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From discovery to development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project builds on earlier research involving a compound called indazole chloride, known for promoting remyelination and modulating the immune system in mouse models of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While effective, indazole chloride lacked the pharmacological properties and patentability needed for clinical development and commercial investment, Tiwari-Woodruff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with UIUC chemists Katzenellenbogen and Sung Hoon Kim, who synthesized the compounds, Tiwari-Woodruff’s research group, led by recent UCR graduate Micah Feri, screened more than 60 indazole chloride analogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collaboration identified two lead candidates, K102 and K110, which exhibited improved safety, efficacy, and drug-like properties in both mouse models and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two, K102 emerged as the lead compound. The researchers found it not only promotes remyelination but also modulates immune function, an important balance for MS therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also showed promising results in human oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting the potential for translatability between the animal models and human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, oligodendrocyte precursor cells mature into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes to repair damaged myelin. In MS, however, this natural repair process often fails, leading to permanent nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful remyelination through a compound like K102 could restore faster nerve conduction and may help reduce long-term disability associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“K110 is also a strong candidate,” Tiwari-Woodruff said. “It has slightly different central nervous system effects and may be better suited for other conditions like spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, so we’re keeping it in the pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From bench to biotech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen credit the National MS Society’s Fast Forward program as a turning point. Fast Forward accelerates the commercialization of promising therapies by promoting academic-industry partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly competitive grant enabled Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen to generate sufficient data to license the rights to Cadenza Bio to develop K102 and K110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patents are jointly held by UCR and UIUC, with an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement in place between the universities and Cadenza Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project has been a good example of how long-standing academic collaborations can lead to real-world applications,” Katzenellenbogen said. “Our shared goal was always to take a promising idea and develop it into a therapy that could help people with MS. We’re finally getting close to that reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, UCR’s Office of Technology Partnerships collaborated with UIUC to seek patent protection. Grace Yee, assistant director of technology commercialization at UCR, said the joint efforts of UCR, UIUC, and the National MS Society advocated for and promoted the technology to investors and industry for commercial development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our entrepreneurs-in-residence also helped advise the project, so the team was able to develop materials and messaging to highlight the project’s commercial value,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When investors expressed interest in the technology, UCR and UIUC helped them understand how the technology addresses an unmet need in treating MS. These efforts led to the licensing agreement with Cadenza Bio.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine Hamm, chief operating officer at Cadenza Bio, said she and Carol Curtis, cofounder of Cadenza Bio, were impressed by the possibility of moving from slowing axon damage to repairing axon damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the future we want to build,” Hamm said. “It is why we licensed the technology, and why we are excited to move it forward to patients in need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than a decade in the making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen have worked together for more than 12 years. Tiwari-Woodruff’s move from UCLA to UCR in 2014, she said, turned out to be a pivotal decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The support from UCR — from leadership to infrastructure — has been extraordinary,” Tiwari-Woodruff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of this would’ve been possible without that backing. Funding for academic labs like mine and John’s is crucial. This is selfless work, driven by a deep love of science and commitment to human health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the initial focus is MS, the team believes K102 and K110 could eventually be applied to other diseases involving neuronal damage, including stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadenza Bio is now advancing K102 through the necessary non-clinical studies required to support first-in-human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re hopeful that clinical trials can begin soon,” said Tiwari-Woodruff. “It’s been a long journey — but this is what translational science is all about: turning discovery into real-world impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was also supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health and Cadenza Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff, Katzenellenbogen, Kim, and Feri were joined in the research by Flavio D.
