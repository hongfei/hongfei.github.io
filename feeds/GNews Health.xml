&lt;p&gt;A recent study has uncovered an unexpected connection between our diets and the progression of &lt;strong&gt;lung cancer,&lt;/strong&gt; specifically a common type known as&lt;strong&gt; pulmonary adenocarcinoma (LUAD)&lt;/strong&gt;. While smoking and environmental factors have long been linked to the disease, this new research shines a light on a surprising dietary factor that could contribute to the growth of lung cancer cells. The study points to &lt;strong&gt;glycogen&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecule typically associated with energy storage, as a potential culprit in accelerating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen Accumulation in Lung Cancer Cells&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01243-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was conducted by researchers at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the &lt;em&gt;University of Florida&lt;/em&gt;. The scientists focused on &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/what-happens-to-body-after-7-days-fasting/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a form of glucose stored in the body as an energy reserve. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that &lt;strong&gt;glycogen accumulates in large amounts in the tissues of patients with LUAD&lt;/strong&gt;, and the presence of higher glycogen levels was linked to faster tumor growth. The researchers used &lt;strong&gt;spatial metabolomics&lt;/strong&gt;, an advanced technology that allows for the mapping of molecules directly within tissues, to study the effects of glycogen on lung cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of glycogen appears to play a critical role in the development of LUAD, acting as a fuel source for the cancer cells. The more glycogen present, the more aggressive the tumor growth becomes. This discovery points to a potential new area for research, suggesting that glycogen could be a factor in how the disease progresses, beyond the well-known environmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of the Western Diet in Cancer Growth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the influence of the &lt;strong&gt;Western diet&lt;/strong&gt;, which is typically rich in fats and sugars, on the growth of lung cancer. In a series of experiments, the researchers fed mice a diet high in fats and sugars, mimicking the eating habits common in Western countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: the mice with elevated glycogen levels in their lung tissues showed &lt;strong&gt;significantly faster tumor growth&lt;/strong&gt; compared to those with lower glycogen levels. This experiment suggests that the excess sugars and fats in the diet may contribute to the buildup of glycogen, which in turn accelerates the development of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings point to an alarming possibility: the foods we eat may be acting as a fuel source for cancer cells, particularly in lung cancer. As glycogen is found to be more abundant in the lungs of cancer patients, the connection between diet and disease progression becomes increasingly evident. This study underscores the importance of considering diet as a factor in cancer development and progression, adding a new dimension to our understanding of lung cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen as a Biomarker for Lung Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to its role in cancer progression, glycogen could become a useful &lt;strong&gt;biomarker&lt;/strong&gt; for monitoring the development of LUAD. By tracking glycogen levels in lung tissues, doctors could potentially assess the severity of the disease and even predict how quickly a tumor might grow. This opens the door to more personalized and effective treatment options, as doctors could tailor interventions based on the glycogen levels in a patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if glycogen proves to be a reliable marker, it could serve as a new target for &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic interventions&lt;/strong&gt;, providing a way to slow or stop tumor growth. The ability to monitor glycogen levels could also lead to more accurate predictions regarding patient outcomes and the efficacy of various treatments. Researchers are now exploring whether reducing glycogen in the lungs could help slow the progression of lung cancer, offering hope for more targeted therapies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Lung Cancer Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study also have significant implications for &lt;strong&gt;public health strategies&lt;/strong&gt; aimed at preventing lung cancer. Just as anti-smoking campaigns have successfully reduced lung cancer rates, promoting healthier dietary habits could be a critical step in reducing the risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health initiatives could focus on educating the public about the impact of high-sugar and high-fat diets on lung cancer, encouraging healthier eating habits as part of an overall cancer prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that encouraging people to adopt healthier eating habits, particularly by reducing their intake of sugars and fats, might help lower the risk of developing LUAD. As our understanding of diet’s role in cancer progression deepens, we may see public health campaigns shift to include dietary advice as a key component in the fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

My friend Laura says her husband keeps a stockpile for his &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/does-eating-chocolate-actually-trigger-migraine.html"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. Liz does, too, as well as Meaghan, who also uses it for vertigo. Emma used it to curtail a bout with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/being-sick-with-a-baby.html"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt; this winter, and is “guarding the remainder of the prescription like it’s solid gold.” Leah tells me, “I have the teeniest dose always on hand for my 6 ½ year old who gets carsick—we refer to it as her ‘magic pill.’” Eva says she’s been “a Zofran girlie since 2013,” popping it whenever nausea rears its queasy head. “ I used it for &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/12/morning-sickness-hyperemesis-gravidarum.html"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;,” she continues, “but I also used it recently when I was feeling slightly off and had dinner reservations at this amazing restaurant and didn’t want to throw up.” Ashley Grady, who I found deep in an Instagram comment section, says she’s used the drug near-daily for fifteen years to manage the nausea that arises from Crohn’s disease. “It’s a godsend,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0df44001c3b771x236j6k@published" data-word-count="208"&gt;It’s not surprising that people would welcome a drug that so seemingly miraculously makes the agony of nausea disappear. Often taken as a dissolving capsule placed under the tongue (it’s tough to swallow a pill when you can’t keep anything down), Zofran, the brand name for ondansetron, is both quick and effective, all but eliminating nausea in as little as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/zofran/how-long-take-zofran-work"&gt;thirty minutes&lt;/a&gt;. A&lt;a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00904"&gt;pproved by the FDA in 1991&lt;/a&gt; for use in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery, it’s changed the game for chemo-induced nausea, with one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10701260/#:~:text=Ondansetron's%20safety%20profile%20and%20well,Rao%20and%20Faso%2C%202012)."&gt;study’s&lt;/a&gt; authors calling it a “necessary medication” in a cancer patient’s arsenal. But as the aforementioned applications of the drug make clear, there are countless off-label uses, too. Zofran makes a stomach virus tolerable, reducing not only discomfort but also dehydration. The drug is a boon for those who are pregnant, hungover, or living with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352161"&gt;Yes, that’s a thing&lt;/a&gt;.) Grady tells me that because Zofran helps her live with Crohn’s, she can eschew other medications for the condition, such as “steroids and biologics and immunosuppressants.” She explains, “as long as I’m able to manage my nausea, I’m saving my kidneys, I’m saving my liver. I’m saving myself 30 pounds of weight that being on Prednisone my whole life gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;

(If people have this condition congenitally, it may be exacerbated by Zofran). Dr. Camille Thélin, an associate professor in the University of South Florida’s division of digestive diseases and nutrition, explains that in QT prolongation, “the interval between heartbeats is longer than normal, which causes the heart to beat irregularly.” This type of arrhythmia is called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21915-torsades-de-pointes"&gt;Torsades de Pointes (TdP)&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a rapid and unpredictable heart rhythm with a mortality rate of between &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.966331/full"&gt;10 and 20 percent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these drugs also prolong the QT interval, but others impact the body’s serotonin receptors, just as Zofran does. Simultaneously taking Zofran and, say, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, or SSRI (the medication class of antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft) could result in a condition known as Serotonin Syndrome. If it’s severe enough and left untreated, it can be fatal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33196298/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s hard to say, says Thélin, because “we all have a different liver makeup based on our genetics. Some people might be fast metabolizers or slow metabolizers, and that can really change the level of serotonin in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dfmp001k3b7726tsikp1@published" data-word-count="113"&gt;Combine these two concerns—long QT intervals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; drug interactions—and the situation can get dangerous quickly, says Jill Deutsch, MD, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of digestive diseases at The Yale School of Medicine. “When people have nausea, it’s often because of something else,” she says — a respiratory infection, a migraine, whatever it might be. “So, the patient is likely taking something for that condition in addition to Zofran. When you use multiple medications with the risk of prolonging the QT, it raises the hairs on the back of my neck.” Some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553159/#:~:text=Prochlorperazine%20and%20chlorpromazine%20are%20dopamine,antiemetic%20and%20migraine%20relief%20effects.&amp;amp;text=Most%20antiemetics%20used%20for%20migraines,prolongation%20and%20torsades%20de%20pointes."&gt;migraine medications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oatext.com/QT-prolongation-by-ranitidine-in-hypokalemia-and-arrhythmogen-provoked-rat-heart.php#:~:text=Currently%20there%20are%20more%20than%2050%20non%2Dcardiac,associated%20with%20case%20reports%20of%20arrhythmia%20[10]."&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are known to prolong the QT interval, as well as certain OTC drugs, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534864/#:~:text=Many%20commonly%20used%20medications%2C%20such,remains%20unknown%20with%20these%20medications."&gt;Benadryl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.okosteo.org/assets/120VAC/Presentations/Saturday/1000%20-%20Drug-Induced%20QT%20Prolongation.pdf"&gt;Pepcid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s conceivable that Zofran could help a doctor-wary sufferer retreat into denial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dftr001m3b77qcb44rwk@published" data-word-count="34"&gt;Arrhythmia and Serotonin Syndrome and potentially dangerous disease-masking do feel like significant hurdles to making Zofran just another medication on the shelf at Walgreens. But from there things get more complicated, and more subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph_drop-cap" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dfzj001o3b77zekn5vdl@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;I’m on the other side of the debate,” says Marlena Fejzo, Ph.D., a geneticist and professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. Fejzo’s research focuses on women’s health, with a particular interest in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12232-hyperemesis-gravidarum"&gt;Hyperemesis Gravidarum&lt;/a&gt; (HG), a condition during pregnancy that causes almost incessant nausea and vomiting, sometimes for the pregnancy’s full duration. I had just told her that the gastroenterologists I’d spoken with had highlighted the risks of making Zofran too accessible. She does not hold back in her disagreement. “If doctors were more willing to prescribe this drug for women to help them during pregnancy, then my answer would be different,” Fejzo says. “But it’s withheld in so many cases because of this fear of adverse outcomes. I think it would be great to have it available and let women make their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; choice about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg16001p3b77wvj5yftl@published" data-word-count="206"&gt;Fejzo&lt;a href="https://time.com/6691524/marlena-fejzo-3/"&gt; herself suffered from HG&lt;/a&gt;, so wracked by her symptoms that she was bedridden and had to receive nourishment first intravenously, then via feeding tube. Ultimately, she miscarried—an outcome that, along with preterm birth, she tells me occurs in 1 in 3 cases of HG. Fejzo says she was dismissed by her doctor, who implied that she was exaggerating her symptoms. This attitude is not uncommon among physicians, Fejzo says. “It’s rooted in historical sexism,” she continues. “I got a recording of an OBGYN, a woman doctor, teaching her medical students that when women are hospitalized with hyperemesis, it’s usually because there’s something going on at home or because they just don’t want to get better. Those were her exact words. She’s repeating this misogynistic nonsense to the next generation of medical students, and they believe her, and it just gets perpetuated.” It’s this attitude that may be what keeps Zofran out of the hands of the pregnant people who need it, Fejzo says: If a doctor doesn’t believe your symptoms are real, they’re unlikely to prescribe you a drug to cure them. Fejzo tells me she has seen cases in which wanted pregnancies were terminated because the HG symptoms were simply too much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg4u001q3b7741gz5n4u@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;Hoping to counteract the misconceptions about Zofran’s risks in pregnancy, Fejzo conducted a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151373/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. “We compared people who took Zofran who had HG to people who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take Zofran and had HG, and then we had controls who did not have HG,” she says. “The risk of adverse outcomes was increased in people with HG compared to the people who did not have it, but the risk was identical for people who had HG whether or not they took Zofran.” In other words, it’s not the drug that’s dangerous to a fetus, it’s the condition it treats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg6n001r3b77x9s60wsl@published" data-word-count="171"&gt;Fejzo believes that the tendency she’s observed for physicians to withhold Zofran from those with HG comes down to a paternalistic belief that women can’t evaluate the drug’s risks on their own and weigh them against the benefits. (This is not dissimilar to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562"&gt;demonstrated underprescribing&lt;/a&gt; of pain medication to women, who are more likely to be given sedatives than painkillers as compared to their male counterparts.) Case in point, Fejzo says, is research that found a miniscule increase in oral clefts of the fetus among pregnant subjects who took Zofran. “The increased risk is tiny. Eleven out of 10,000 people who did not take Zofran during pregnancy got an oral cleft in their fetus versus 14 out of 10,000 among those who did take it. So, there were only three more out of 10,000, which is a way lower risk than, for example, the risk of miscarrying after an amniocentesis, which is one in 200 to one in 400. Yet doctors allow women to make that choice all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg8w001s3b771rkkdbg9@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;I also spoke with Dr. Nicholas Ghionni, a Baltimore-based pulmonologist who works in the ICU. He had commented on an Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/rubin_allergy/reel/DEllts3RPnw/?hl=en"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; regarding the dangers of Zofran by Dr. Zachary Rubin, the doctor behind @rubin_allergy, an account with 1 million followers. The post explored the QT interval and Torsades de Pointes concerns, with countless people ringing alarm bells in the comments. “I take this medicine every single morning,” one person wrote. “Now I’m freaked out.” Another said, “I had no idea. I thought it was safe.” But Ghionni’s retort called for a dose of perspective. “Torsades was seen in patients who took massive doses in a chemo study (32 mg at a time),” he wrote; the standard dosage for run-of-the-mill nausea in adults is far lower, around 4 milligrams. “Furthermore,” Ghionni continued, “how does this matter if you go to your PCP and get Zofran and then go home? You’re not on continuous monitoring.” In fact, in his daily work in the ICU, Ghionni tells me, he doesn’t bother with heart monitors for a low dose of Zofran.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dga9001t3b77tsu0m0qk@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“Medicine is very dogmatic,” Ghionni says. “And all of these rules are hammered into you as an intern—one of which is ‘Zofran causes QT prolongation, be careful.’” To Ghionni, this is just an echo of how medicine has always operated: Everyone practices in the way they’ve been taught to, until “people come along and challenge the dogma and ask, okay, do we have &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; of harm or benefit?” Zofranophobe doctors might start by reading the actual &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-new-information-regarding-qt-prolongation-ondansetron-zofran"&gt;FDA warning&lt;/a&gt; attached to the drug, because Ghionni’s comment was correct about the discrepancy between the standard dose of 4 milligrams of ingested Zofran and the 32 milligram intravenous dose that was was associated with prolonged QT. Per that warning, the 32 milligram dose should be “avoided,” but there’s no risk mentioned regarding the far lower doses of Zofran that most people receive. So why, Ghionni wonders, should Zofran be, “picked out as the bad boy on the block?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dgbn001u3b77agoz8kyk@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;Which brings us to a glaring logical flaw in the prescription-only side of the Zofran debate: Ondansetron is arguably no more dangerous or prone to side effects than any number of OTC medications. Take  acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) for example, too much of which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html"&gt;a rare fatal skin reaction and liver failure&lt;/a&gt;, or cough syrups with &lt;a href="https://oxfordtreatment.com/substance-abuse/hallucinogens/dxm/"&gt;Dextromethorphan&lt;/a&gt;, which is hallucinogenic in high doses and famously prone to abuse. “I totally get why people say, yes, Zofran should be available, and others say, no, it shouldn’t be available,” says Deutsch. “I tend to argue that things like Advil and Tylenol shouldn’t be so readily available over the counter, even though they’re likely safe in most cases.” She thinks it all comes down to timing, and the way the FDA has changed its approach to regulation over the years: “It’s very, very, very infrequent that you see a new medication regulated by the FDA available over the counter anymore. If Zofran had been around 20 or 30 years earlier, it probably would’ve been OTC.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dge4001v3b77iy1b2vex@published" data-word-count="215"&gt;Deutsch also taught me an industry term: &lt;em&gt;therapeutic misadventure&lt;/em&gt;. It refers to adverse effects  stemming from the attempt to address a medical problem—and, in this context, to the ways in which the average person consumes medications they don’t realize are dangerous. “You’re trying to treat your pain or nausea,” Deutsch says, offering a hypothetical. “You take one pill, and it helps a little but you’re still in discomfort, so you think,&lt;em&gt; wouldn’t a second pill help more?&lt;/em&gt; It makes perfect sense, except that with medications, more is not necessarily better.” It’s easier to make OTC medication mistakes than you may realize, and every year, roughly &lt;a href="https://ph.health.mil/topics/healthyliving/asm/Pages/OverCounter.aspx"&gt;178,000 people&lt;/a&gt; wind up in the hospital for this reason. A Zofran misadventure doesn’t seem outside the realm of possibility; if you’re nauseous, you’re distracted. Did you take the last dose two hours ago, or three? You took it in tablet form, then threw up—do you take it again? You skipped a dose because you felt okay, but now you’re queasy. If the directive on the package is to take no more than 24 mg per day, and you’d still be below that threshold, can you take two? The point is, it’s easy to get lost in the nuances, and hidden in all that medicine minutiae are opportunities for mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dgi7001w3b77n3w92971@published" data-word-count="22"&gt;But is it likely that one of those mistakes will be to accidentally take 32 milligrams of Zofran intravenously? No, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it kept from patients because of sexism, or inflated fears, or dogmatic thinking, or because it was created thirty years too late? It’s hard to say. But the case for OTC ondansetron is compelling. Prolonged QT intervals are rare, as is Serotonin Syndrome. The FDA could require, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/legal-requirements-sale-and-purchase-drug-products-containing-pseudoephedrine-ephedrine-and"&gt;as it does for cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine&lt;/a&gt; (a key ingredient in methamphetamine), that Zofran only be sold in limited doses to those able to present a government ID. And anyway, as Fejzo points out, even in hospital settings there’s often not as much attention paid to arrhythmia-related concerns as you might think. “Even when Zofran is prescribed,” Fejzo says, echoing Ghionni, “are people on it being monitored? Are they checking their hearts? No, I doubt it.” A Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hvfwam/if_the_concern_for_ordering_zofran_is_prolonged/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from late last year in r/nursing suggests not: “When I worked med/surg, we gave [Zofran] to almost everyone who needed antiemetics and we didn’t need the patients on tele or EKG to do so”—meaning nurses were not asked to monitor patients’ heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

Happily, he agreed. However, going the artificial insemination route is expensive, so we are going to use the turkey baster method. When I told my sister, she was aghast and said it was a terrible idea. Even worse, she told our mother (without my consent), who in turn told my aunts, cousins, and grandmother, and now they’re all up in arms! How do I put this fire out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwl001o3b76gieyq8tp@published"&gt;Our daughter-in-law, “Alyssa,” has been a widow for four years. I adore her; she and our son, “Brian,” were so in love. But I don’t know how to bring up an awkward topic: dating again. Brian was diagnosed with aggressive leukemia at 27 and never got to turn 28. They’d always wanted kids, especially Allie. Sadly, Allie had a late miscarriage after his diagnosis. It was a horrible time for everyone, but Allie was consumed by the combined grief. We invited her to stay with us after his death because we loved her, and I was frankly worried about her well-being. She was working and seeing friends, but it was like she was sleepwalking through it all, and her physical health was visibly bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalh2fpk00293b76juhwhmci@published"&gt;Alyssa slowly recovered and took the initiative to move into her own place two years ago. She seems well, and we still see her often, but she doesn’t seem to be dating, even casually. Last year, I gently suggested getting out there, and she sharply told me it was way too soon. But if she wants a baby, the time window to meet someone isn’t that long. I want her to have the family she talks about, and I know her own dad is pushing the “too soon” narrative at her. Her parents were worse than useless in her early widowhood: They got a divorce a few weeks before Brian’s death and then tried to get family to pick sides after his funeral. How can I gently suggest she consider dating anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001r3b76em2321sl@published"&gt;I can tell how much you care about Alyssa and sincerely want the best for her. I think it’s great that you’ve continued to nurture your relationship and want her to find love, even though I imagine seeing her with a new partner might bring up some complicated feelings about Brian. She’s lucky to have you in her life, cheering for her to rebuild and find happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001s3b76uyjasc2k@published"&gt;But you need to take a big step back. When it comes to shaping Alyssa’s future, your role is to be a loving mother-in-law who can connect with her about a major source of grief. That’s it. You shouldn’t be a matchmaker or a fertility awareness counselor. And you definitely, definitely want to avoid becoming a source of stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwo001t3b76jnh0s5n7@published"&gt;Also, believe me, there is no way this woman is unaware of the typical age range in which people have biological children. She has friends and internet access. She knows. She may very well miss the window for that specific kind of motherhood, because she’s just not ready to get back out there and find a partner in time. If that happens, it won’t be a tragedy. In fact, it will actually be much better than forcing herself to date while she’s still in mourning, having a child, and then experiencing yet another devastating loss when the relationship doesn’t work out because she wasn’t over your son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003h3b76gkt5t1wm@published"&gt;I have been divorced for three years, and I have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. My ex and I share equal custody, and I never thought she would play games like this using our kids. I have only been dating casually until I met “Emily.” We are talking about marriage, and after I informed my ex, she changed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="223" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003i3b76klrpj50h@published"&gt;Now she can’t bear not hearing from our kids every single night I have them. She has to video chat with them for up to an hour every night and uses guilt tactics against our kids. I essentially feel like she has invaded my home, especially with Emily over. We have no privacy, and my ex tells the kids to show her the house when she calls. It is the same one I have owned since the divorce. If I take away their devices and tell my kids they will see their mom in a few days, they get hysterical. My 7-year-old has more meltdowns than they did as a toddler. This has only started since I told my ex about Emily, so it is obvious that she feels threatened and needs to get her claws in. We already had a big issue with her trying to change the custody drop-off from my work to my home, despite it being far away from her own (my work is equally distant from both houses). My ex denies everything, and I can’t afford to take her back to court. I love Emily and my kids. I am ready to start a new chapter in our lives. Emily and the kids got along great until now. I don’t want this issue to screw that up. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfh003l3b76rpjxa69a@published"&gt;This is tough because while you know your ex is using the nightly calls to insert herself into your new life, to put an end to them would upset and maybe even hurt your kids. You could end up—fairly or not—looking like the bad guy. In conflicts like this one, between divorced parents, I always think it’s important to keep your eye on the prize: your children’s well-being, and how you’ll look when they think back on the situation when they’re 30. The goal is for their therapists to one day say, “It sounds like your dad was a really safe person for you and put your needs first.” Sometimes, that means letting your ex win, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfi003m3b76wvnui0h0@published"&gt;But I also understand how unsettled you are by her thinly-veiled protest against the new relationship. So you should beat her at her own game. Everyone can gather around the iPad and call her together—yes, Emily too! You could start suggesting virtual game nights and remote dance parties. You might even volunteer to initiate the calls: “Hey, Em and the kids and I are making pancakes. Would you like me to FaceTime so you can see the process?” Your kids will get the contact they want with their mom and the very important feeling that the adults in their lives are kind to each other. You’ll totally avoid being the villain. You’ll take the mystery out of Emily’s presence. And eventually, I guarantee, your ex will get bored or see that she’s not getting under your skin the way she hoped she would, and her FaceTime fixation will slowly fade &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2833575" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And a significant number of those children have a parent whose addiction is moderate or severe as opposed to mild, the study finds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The number amounts to 1 in 4 children with a parent who has addiction.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm an addiction doc, and so I think about this issue all the time," says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/22683/scott-hadland" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Hadland&lt;/a&gt;, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study. "Even still, I was surprised at how high that percentage was. It's just an enormous number of kids that are affected."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If one-quarter of kids in the U.S. have a parent with a substance use disorder, that tells us that every day in our clinics we are encountering many, if not dozens of families that are affected by substance use disorders," he adds. "And we need to be poised and ready to help support those families."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, a federal survey that estimated the prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders based on the most updated criteria in the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V&lt;/em&gt; (DSM-5). The national survey is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but the team in charge of the survey &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2474698-us-government-fired-researchers-running-a-crucial-drug-use-survey/" target="_blank"&gt;was let go&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recent reduction in force. It is unclear how the cuts will affect the future of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study's main finding is significantly higher than previous estimates (&lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/faa1b19e66053008e89782914f0aa693/children-at-risk-of-sud.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7 million in a 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;), which had relied on diagnostic criteria from the DSM-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new study also estimated how many children have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction as opposed to mild.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We also found that 7.6 million children live in a household with a parent that has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder," says study author &lt;a href="https://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/sean-esteban-mccabe" target="_blank"&gt;Sean Esteban McCabe&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan. "And 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McCabe and his team also found that more than 6 million children have a parent with a mental health condition in addition to a substance use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"These estimates are incredibly important to understand the scope of parental substance use disorder in the United States," wrote &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/doctors/20360/davida-schiff" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Davida Schiff&lt;/a&gt; in an email. Schiff is a pediatrician and addiction medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another notable finding in the study, according to Schiff, is that a majority of the parents — 12 million — had alcohol use disorder. "While alcohol is more socially acceptable in our society, the study points to a need to pay greater attention to a rising number of children exposed to parental alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's also important to remember that alcohol is actually the leading cause of substance-related deaths in the United States," notes Hadland. "It actually kills more people in the U.S. than do opioids every year, but it's a slower death rate. It's a chronic disease process that affects, you know, somebody's liver, somebody's risk of developing cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And children of parents with addiction are themselves at a higher risk of various physical and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Young children growing up in homes affected by parental SUD (substance use disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing impaired caregiving, disruption of parental abilities, unintentional ingestions, and witnessing parental overdose," wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They are also at a higher risk of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;developing certain &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/08/nx-s1-5389885/medicaid-payments-barely-keep-hospital-mental-health-units-afloat-federal-cuts-could-sink-them" target="_blank"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and substance use problems in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One thing that I'm doing as a pediatrician is when I'm caring for a young person who has a parent with a substance use disorder, is making sure that I'm doing a good job asking about and screening for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, ADHD, all of which we know can be more common in kids of parents with addiction," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/2/e20161575/52464/Families-Affected-by-Parental-Substance-Use?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;ask patients&lt;/a&gt; and/or parents about substance use in the family in order to educate them about the risks of substance use and connect families to treatment when needed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We as pediatricians and family medicine doctors might think about screening parents for substance use and substance use disorders when they come into our clinics to help make sure that we can identify problems and get parents connected to treatment, because that's probably in the best interest of their child," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatric clinics affiliated with Mass General Brigham in the Boston area use a developmental screening that &lt;a href="https://www.teamupforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SWYC-2-Month-English-Age-specific-2021.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;includes questions about parental substance use&lt;/a&gt;, wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents with addiction love their children and want the best for them, she says, but may not access treatment because of stigma about seeking help for addiction and barriers to accessing care.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For parents with substance use disorder, Schiff says, she and her colleagues "discuss safe storage of substances, identification of a safe and sober caregiver for children during periods of active use, and provide training in naloxone administration should an unintentional ingestion occur."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for parents with addiction who have infants, she recommends avoiding breastfeeding after using substances and discusses safe sleep practices "to prevent unsafe sleep injuries and infant suffocation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that over three-fourths of people with substance use disorders do not get treatment," says McCabe. "And kids who are in households with parents that don't get help are much less likely to get help themselves. So I just think it's important for us who serve and provide care to children to understand what these numbers mean and also how we can design programs to meet these kids where they're at."&lt;/p&gt;

He gathered his family, helped older neighbors to their cars and fled without a single keepsake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the days that followed, Dr. Elsayegh, a pulmonologist, did not have a chance to grieve. As he did his rounds with patients at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., his cellphone was bombarded with neighbors and friends seeking his expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;What kind of air purifier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;Is an N-95 mask enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;My daughter has asthma — should we rent a place farther away?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Forty phone calls a day with the same set of questions,” Dr. Elsayegh recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So when the chief administrative officer of the hospital invited him into his office to ask Dr. Elsayegh how he could support him and his family, Dr. Elsayegh replied instead, “Let’s open a clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Just three weeks after the blaze tore through neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the hospital’s urban fire clinic for pulmonary issues began seeing patients. They came in droves, each with a different set of symptoms and concerns. The clinic has served as an early indicator of the types of health problems developing among those exposed to the fires, ranging from newfound shortness of breath in healthy people to exacerbated symptoms in patients with asthma, C.O.P.D. and other lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The health effects of an urban fire differ from a those of a wildfire, and when an entire community burns quickly, releasing unquantifiable toxins in unexpected directions for an unknowable period of time, there are long-term health effects that no expert can yet fully calculate. Dr. Elsayegh is making it his mission to support patients from the Palisades and surrounding communities for months and years into the future, when, he fears, cleanup crew members and others with chronic exposure may begin to show signs of severe lung diseases, like asbestosis and silicosis, and even cancers like mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

In the body, these nutrients from foods go on to aid cells, organs and body systems, carrying out chemical and physical functions essential for health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers and scientists have studied the effect of certain foods on our brains and a “reduced risk of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/alzheimers-disease" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and a slower rate of cognitive decline” has been noted when certain diets are followed. However, other foods commonly eaten were “associated with a higher risk of developing dementia and worse cognition”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK reports that “almost half (45%) of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/dementia" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed”. The charity linked such cases to “factors that affect our health throughout our life” with diet playing an important part along with other lifestyle choices and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red meat, processed meats and saturated fat can increase the risk of dementia, heart disease and diabetes, reports Alzheimer’s Research UK. The organisation explained that “foods like sausages and other processed meats, butter, cheese and cakes can be high in saturated fat” which can lead to many health issues - and these other diseases can up your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/reducing-your-risk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;report from Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt; stated: “What’s good for your heart is good for your brain. That’s because the brain relies on a good blood supply to stay healthy. Taking steps to look after our heart can help lower our risk of cardiovascular diseases, and our risk of dementia too.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK added that “eating too much saturated fat and sugar” can also “increase the risk” of dementia. The charity advises eating a healthy balanced diet, keeping your BMI at a healthy level and keeping as active as possible day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging (NIA) also reported on foods and brain health, explaining that it’s possible that “eating a certain diet affects biological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that underlie Alzheimer’s”. NIA explained the possible link between a person’s diet indirectly “affecting other Alzheimer’s risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NIA reports &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;on the topic&lt;/a&gt;: “For example, the typical Western diet increases cardiovascular disease risk, possibly contributing to faster brain aging. A growing area of research focuses on the relationship between gut microbes - tiny organisms in the digestive system - and aging-related processes that lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The important role of physical activity and exercise, and how this interacts with diet, cardiovascular health, and brain health must also be considered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NIA added&lt;/a&gt;: “Many foods - blueberries, leafy greens, and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric), to name a few - have been studied for their potential cognitive benefit. These foods have been thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or other properties that might help protect the brain. However, so far, there is no evidence that eating or avoiding a specific food can prevent Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Still, scientists continue to look for clues. A recent study showed that a molecule in green tea breaks apart tangles of the protein tau, which builds up in the brain due to Alzheimer’s. Based on this finding, the team identified other potential Alzheimer’s drug candidates. Another study, based on older adults’ reports of their eating habits, found that eating a daily serving of leafy green vegetables such as spinach or kale was associated with slower age-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to the neuroprotective effects of certain nutrients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Research has also shown that a diet that includes regular fish consumption is associated with higher cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with age.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK also pointed out several other factors that could help lower your risk of dementia such as looking after your hearing and sight, drinking less alcohol, being physically active and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other environmental factors including air pollution, quality of early years education, social deprivation and social isolation could all lead to a higher risk of the disease, Alzheimer’s Research UK reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "We have more control over some of these factors than others. For example, we often can’t change how much air pollution we are exposed to. But we can do more physical activity and watch what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPRUxFUVk0NHVmXzZTR0xZRXFfemNOUXBxdUhCbG5WbUZUTEVOZjQ3QlhvbUNteEh1aEVGRTg2VnBveVlpQXNzdjJlTVVQZ3p5QTNsN0tVRVlWN3c1VDBaR2x1MHVNRXNtU0pZN2x3Ti1qbU1jck1fdG1yVi1Nd3RkWnpB0gGHAUFVX3lxTE1BVE1rdlgxUVh0bVIteTlGLTM3RDBIR1RxenJGd3VVYjRCYk9fVnNVc09UaDRIWDNCcGFwRU4yV01nTGtiZFZoaGZuMDE5ZjNodWVrZUpPa1U5MkZNU3F1VU1pR0p6cmpfMVFadnI2cVctMF80b01EWm85T25VYk9BWTctOWlEUQ</guid></item><item><title>我被诊断患有晚期结肠癌，因为我消除了他们进食后数百万人的症状-每日邮报 | I was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer after brushing off symptom that strikes millions after they eat - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heather Candrilli had been suffering from bloating and stomach pain for years but blamed it on her diet and giving birth to two children. So, when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-853857c0-2f40-11f0-a288-bfe0bf43e896"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, her world was turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 36-year-old mother of two was determined to beat her diagnosis - which has a survival rate of 13 percent - and she 'hit the ground running' and started an aggressive chemotherapy regimen in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's been been hit with painful side effects and medical bills that could exceed half a million dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her husband, Corey Candrilli, a disabled US Army combat veteran said: 'I don’t understand exactly what she’s going through, but I understand pain. I understand the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to try and remove tumors, but her fight isn't over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said his wife's delayed diagnosis - she visited multiple doctors and had her symptoms dismissed - puts a spotlight on the need for a law that would require insurance companies to cover colonoscopies for younger patients with certain symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonscopies are the gold standard for screening for the disease, which is on the rise in young people across the US. They are typically recommended to begin at 45 and occur every 10 years so long as results are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lack of - and confusion over - insurance coverage has led people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556451/reason-colon-cancer-cases-rising-colonoscopy-charges.html"&gt;delay screening or has burdened them with bills for thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli is a mom-of-two who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On most insurance plans, the procedure should cost on average $79 out-of-pocket, with health insurers footing the rest of the about $2,125 bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, patients have come forward to say they've been charged upward of $5,000, $7,000 and even $20,000 for the procedure, despite having health insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple live in New York, where the law requires insurance coverage for colonoscopies only for people 45 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t get it. It’s unbelievable,’' Mr Candrilli &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.silive.com/news/2025/05/amazing-young-mother-battles-stage-4-colon-cancer-after-delayed-diagnosis.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; SI Live of colonoscopies before 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s truly unbelievable. These are your teachers, your parents, people raising your children. These are our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The army veteran said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but, 'when you're about that age, you're busy rising a family, and the last thing you're going to be thinking about is yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli was tested for the chronic autoimmune diseases crohn's and celiac, but the couple said a colonoscopy was never suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an ultrasound of Mrs Candrilli's stomach detected something on her liver, then a colonoscopy was performed, which revealed an aggressively growing tumor that had spread to other parts of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said: 'As soon as they ordered the colonoscopy, they saw the tumor right there on her colon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cory Candrilli, an army veteran, said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but a colonoscopy was never suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After undergoing 20 rounds of chemotherapy, Mrs Candrilli is awaiting a liver transplant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli underwent surgery to remove a portion of her colon and is now awaiting a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her initial surgery, she has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy, which her husband said are shrinking the tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These sessions required her to spend four hours in the hospital every two weeks to receive the medication and then wear an external device that continued delivering chemotherapy to her for 48 hours after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the treatments are working, Mr Candrilli said the family cannot keep up with medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It’s ridiculously expensive.

&lt;/b&gt;AI tool called FaceAge, an algorithm designed to tell patients’ biological age from a photograph as simple as a selfie ― not how old they are in years, but how old they are in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QS2FDN7R6JCWXD3734PAB5X3AU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Biological age is considered crucial in helping doctors determine the most appropriate therapy, such as whether a cancer patient is healthy enough to tolerate an aggressive treatment. FaceAge requires more testing before doctors can begin using it routinely, but scientists said that in the next week or two, they expect to begin enrolling about 50 patients in a pilot study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6FFVQLR3HNC7RK7OH4B3ZQKGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy. Most of the photos were publicly available on Wikipedia and the internet movie database IMDb, while some came from UTKFace, a large-scale dataset with pictures of people from less than a year old to 116 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZO35VDMIAVBQRPIF76DUXSLW6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The developers of FaceAge tested it on a group of 6,200 cancer patients, using photographs taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment. The algorithm determined that when it came to their health, cancer patients were, on average, about five years older than their chronological age.

class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve been sniffling, sneezing, rubbing your itchy eyes and wondering: What is going on this year?! Well, here’s the not-so-great news—seasonal allergies are brutal in 2025.And if you’re living in certain parts of the U.S., it’s like walking into a pollen storm every time you step outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this happening? Two words: climate change. Warmer temperatures and more CO₂ mean longer growing seasons, which means more pollen. Add to that a bit of pollution and urbanization, and you’ve got yourself the perfect sneeze-fest. Pollen becomes stickier, stays in the air longer, and triggers stronger reactions than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious which cities are leading the pack in allergy misery this year? The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) dropped its annual list, and well… let’s just say, some cities are definitely not doing your sinuses any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top 10 worst US cities for pollen in 2025&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichita takes the top spot for the third year in a row. The combo of open plains, heavy pollen winds, and not-so-great access to allergists makes this city an allergy sufferer’s nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumped a whopping 30 spots since last year. Why? That warm, sticky, humid weather means pollen basically never takes a day off. Plus, recent hurricanes added even more moisture—pollen’s BFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree and grass pollen are off the charts. Add in one of the highest over-the-counter allergy med usage rates in the country, and it’s clear: people here are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same deal as Oklahoma. High pollen counts, lots of meds being used, and a big ol’ bowl of allergy soup in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are worse than average here, and people are loading up on allergy meds left and right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple threat: tree, grass, and weed pollen. Even with decent access to allergy specialists, it’s a rough ride for sensitive noses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;7. Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raleigh’s got all three pollen types in full swing—and fewer allergy doctors per capita, which doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;8. Richmond, Virginia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pollen levels across the board, though slightly better access to specialists means folks have some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;9. Greenville, South Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are the main culprits here. Med use is high, so clearly people are feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;10. Greensboro, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree, grass, and weed pollen are worse than average here too, making outdoor activities feel like punishment for anyone with allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you actually do about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in one of these cities (or even nearby), don’t panic. You’re not doomed to a life of tissues and antihistamine fog. Here’s how to fight back against the pollen army:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your meds early: Don’t wait until you’re already a sniffly mess. Get a jump start with antihistamines before peak season hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your windows shut: Yes, even if the weather’s perfect. Run the AC instead—it filters the air and keeps pollen out of your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shower when you come in: Pollen loves to cling to skin and hair. Give yourself a rinse after being outside, especially during high-pollen hours (usually morning and early evening).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the pollen forecast: Sites like Pollen.com or even your weather app give you daily pollen updates. Plan your outdoor time when counts are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to an allergist: Seriously, don’t suffer in silence. A specialist can set you up with a treatment plan, which may include allergy testing or even long-term solutions like immunotherapy (a.k.a. allergy shots).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The content in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever felt like a song really resonates with you? That may be more true than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is often thought of as a '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-could-be-a-universal-language-we-all-understand"&gt;universal language&lt;/a&gt;' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-sends-a-pleasurable-chill-through-the-brain-and-scientists-can-see-it"&gt; so good to us&lt;/a&gt; because they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/study-suggests-we-dont-just-hear-music-become-it-365203"&gt;says Caroline Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. "That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;perspective paper&lt;/a&gt; reviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg" alt="Music Literally Resonates With Our Brain Rhythms, New Theory Says" class="wp-image-160576 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-720x415.jpg 720w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-768x443.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-1536x886.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-600x346.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2.jpg 1809w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt; oscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-humans-cant-even-hear-makes-us-dance-more-experiment-shows"&gt;move your body to music&lt;/a&gt;. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"High groove ratings" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hit-songs-do-something-to-your-brain-and-it-could-be-the-future-of-music"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt; tends to fall right in the middle of that range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-adorable-sea-lion-can-keep-a-beat-better-than-some-humans"&gt;universal joy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18003/lifestyle-diets/vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based recipes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 359 to 419 calories while the lunches span 354 to 496 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_192-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant-based diets are linked with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;number of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. They’re particularly beneficial for heart health since they tend to be low in saturated fat and high in fiber. Plant-based diets can also help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and certain kinds of cancers.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients in plant foods help promote a healthy gut microbiome, which improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation and supports gut health.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to cut out animal products entirely to reap these benefits. For example, the Mediterranean diet includes small amounts of dairy, eggs, fish and poultry, and it’s linked with loads of health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, prioritizing plant foods can make a difference when it comes to your health.

Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's happening? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute tracked Parkinson's diagnoses in Olmsted County, Minnesota, over a 24-year span, cross-referencing patient addresses with the locations of 139 nearby golf courses. The &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/residential-proximity-golf-courses-linked-parkinsons-disease-2025a1000bau" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealed a clear pattern: the closer someone lived to a golf course, the higher their odds of developing Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And it's not just air exposure. Residents whose tap water came from groundwater sources near a golf course had nearly double the risk of developing the disease. Those living in "vulnerable groundwater regions" — where rainwater can carry chemicals through porous bedrock more easily — faced even greater odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This isn't about golf," said Dr. Michael Okun, national medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "It's about pesticides, environmental exposures, and preventable risks hiding in plain sight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this concerning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parkinson's disease is a serious progressive condition that impacts movement, speech, and cognitive function. There's no cure — and cases are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Newsweek &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/parkinsons-disease-linked-golf-courses-new-study-2070602" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:covered;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Okun recently posted to X, formerly Twitter, saying, "Parkinson's cases are exploding. We now face 11.8 million cases globally, and the numbers are climbing fast. Despite this reality, we still spend just 2 to 3 cents of every Parkinson's dollar on prevention. That has to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics do play a role, environmental factors like pesticide exposure are increasingly being linked to the disease. Chemicals such as paraquat and rotenone — often used to maintain lush greens — have been shown to trigger Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the U.S. has pesticide risks up to 15 times higher on golf courses than &lt;a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/03/pesticide-dangers-at-golf-courses-much-higher-in-the-us-than-europe-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;European countries&lt;/a&gt; do, according to Beyond Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting our outdoor environments, especially in urban and suburban areas, may not be as safe as they seem — especially when aesthetics are prioritized over health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's being done about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study doesn't explicitly call for people to move away from golf courses, experts say there's a clear need to reevaluate how pesticides are used in public spaces. Cities and states can take action by tightening regulations on chemical applications near residential areas and upgrading municipal water treatment in high-risk zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For those living near golf courses, consider reaching out to local environmental health agencies to learn about pesticide transparency laws and groundwater safety initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Dr. Okun noted, "This is a warning we can't ignore.

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Skinny” is such an outdated concept; too diet culture for 2025. “Flat belly” sounds better, but we’re tired of that, too. What is the trend-dependent online influencer culture to do? Enter “gut health,” the current euphemism for having a thin waist—this time with extra wellness baggage. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like it’s all about a science-based journey toward better nutrition, but really it’s more bullshit. So let’s explore the most questionable gut health hacks out there. Grab a towel, because it’s time for your internal shower!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-an-internal-shower"&gt;Taking an 'internal shower'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "internal shower" is meant to clean you from the inside. The metaphor evokes more than just relieving constipation, and implies that your guts are dirty and need to be made sparkling clean. That's not how gut health works—things should keep moving, sure, but there's no need to fully clean everything out unless you're preparing for a colonoscopy (which has its own protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though “internal shower” sounds fancy, it's really just a drink that contains two full tablespoons of chia seeds, plus a squeeze of lemon. Chia seeds swell in water, forming a lumpy, gel-like texture. (This is both what makes them good in pudding, and what allows them to adhere to the terra-cotta planters of &lt;a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="content_body" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-event_label="Chia Pet" href="https://zdcs.link/QVX4K3?pageview_type=Standard&amp;amp;template=Opinions&amp;amp;module=content_body&amp;amp;element=offer&amp;amp;item=text-link&amp;amp;element_label=Chia%20Pet&amp;amp;short_url=QVX4K3&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsilliest-gut-health-trends&amp;amp;event_label=Chia%20Pet" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"&gt;Chia Pet&lt;/a&gt; fame.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why drink them? Well, they’re high in fiber, and you also consume a glass of water in the process. In other words, it’s a trendier version of Metamucil. Be warned: the sudden increase of fiber in your diet can lead to bloating and diarrhea if you’re not used to it, but isn’t likely to be harmful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoiding-cheese"&gt;Avoiding cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that a diverse diet with plenty of plant foods is probably better for your gut than a crappy diet—but not for any game-changing, gut-specific reason. Your gut is healthy when your body is healthy, and a varied diet involving fiber and other nutrients is good for your gut microbes and for the rest of you. This amounts to “eat your vegetables,” and is thus not an exciting viral tip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health advice often gives you a list of foods not to eat, or demonizes specific foods. There are no common foods known to be particularly destructive to gut health—we're built to handle just about anything—but influencers often target processed foods and dairy foods. This means that cheese has emerged as a mythically problematic food, when in fact it's probably fine—and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250303/Cheese-isnt-just-foode28094ite28099s-a-microbiome-booster-study-confirms.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;some studies suggest that it may even be particularly beneficial.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-l-glutamine"&gt;Taking L-glutamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of “gut health” has led influencers to tell you that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go out and get some L-glutamine (available in any store’s supplement aisle) to heal or prevent your leaky gut. Some of these videos include actual scientific facts about what we understand glutamine to do in the body. But that itself should set off alarm bells: When somebody talks about the mechanism of how something is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to work, without presenting data on whether it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works for the intended outcome, chances are you’re on the wrong path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L-glutamine is an amino acid that our body can usually make for itself. There is evidence that supplementing it is helpful for people with serious bowel diseases, sepsis, injuries like extensive burns, and immune disorders. The Canadian Society for Intestinal Research &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/health-nutrition/glutamine/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that you should consult a physician if you think you have conditions serious enough to affect your body’s ability to make enough glutamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anything-called-an-elixir"&gt;Anything called an "elixir" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an incredible depth and breadth of "gut health elixir" recipes available on TikTok and other platforms. There are gut health elixirs with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danalholden/video/7132270278515789102" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;aloe juice and coconut water&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pamicakess/video/7476892094813113646" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;olive oil and lemon&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emselement/video/7262353622904786222" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;hibiscus and kombucha&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eatplantswithalana/video/7455452717121817902" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;turmeric and ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt;. What do any of these have in common? Gut health, of course. What a silly question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="washing-our-fruit-for-gut-health"&gt;Washing our fruit (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing your fruit is fine. Believing that unwashed fruit is the only thing standing between you and a snatched stomach—that I can't get behind. The idea is that fresh produce has pesticides on it, and those pesticides are killing your good gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; a good idea to &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/wash-all-your-fruit-even-the-kind-you-peel-1844248118" target=""&gt;rinse fruit before you eat it&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no link between the barely-detectable trace amounts of pesticides on fruit and the health of your gut or the size of your waistline. This isn’t a gut health tip, it’s just sensible food prep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pilates-for-gut-health"&gt;Pilates (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates is low-key strength training. It can be good for you, as almost any exercise can, but it doesn't work miracles. I've already covered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-do-so-many-tiktok-influencers-want-us-to-do-pilates-1849072506" target=""&gt;the trend of TikTok influencers making up imaginary benefits of Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, but “gut health” is a stretch. Influencers claim (as in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@darcieratcliff/video/7237160382400400666" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;) that the breathwork and twisting motions of Pilates "massage" your gut to cure constipation, sometimes also referencing the &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-gut-health-trend-1850844490" target="_blank"&gt;complete myth&lt;/a&gt; that we have pounds of "stuck" poop inside our guts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JV31AQ0WPNGQ1D1R9YESP272);

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eating-30-plants-a-day"&gt;Eating 30 plants a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually like this as a hack for increasing the diversity of your diet: count up the number of plant species you eat each week, and aim to get more than you currently do. Lettuce and tomato on your sandwich? Add the wheat from the bun and you’re already up to three. This idea got its start with &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf-uk.org/our-blog/could-you-eat-30-plant-based-foods-each-week/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;research from the American Gut Project&lt;/a&gt;, which found people who ate a more varied diet had a more diverse gut microbiome—although there is no specific link to health, and scientists still haven’t found a way of determining what a “healthy” microbiome looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of that has mutated quite a bit on social media. In one clip I remember watching, the narrator tells us that the difference between her before and after pictures is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to “cardio and a restrictive diet.” But she has clearly lost fat. Gut health is just the new code word for losing fat. Nearly every one of the videos I’ve highlighted here starts with a before-and-after of somebody’s soft, then toned, tummy. If it were really about “bloating,” you’d be able to see the same abs in both pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="going-for-a-walk-every-morning"&gt;Going for a walk every morning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walks are good! Morning routines are good! And it’s true that your gut has its own “clock” for telling what time it is. Some influencers get it backwards, though, when they suggest getting morning light to set your gut’s clock. In truth, the gut sets its clock &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867408010672" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;based on when you feed it&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to set your gut’s clock in the morning, try eating breakfast. Like a whole, actual breakfast, not a glass of &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/lemon-water-doesn-t-do-anything-1822932908" target=""&gt;lemon water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going for a walk may help your digestion—that's the whole idea of the "fart walk," a walk taken after dinner that &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-a-fart-walk" target="_blank"&gt;may relieve feelings of bloating&lt;/a&gt; and that can also help your body to control glucose levels. Feel free to take one after breakfast instead of waiting until dinnertime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="oil-pulling"&gt;Oil pulling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; old thing? (I need to stop being surprised when old health trends make a comeback.) Oil pulling is when you swish coconut oil around your mouth, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, in addition to (or in place of) brushing your teeth. &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/oil-pulling-doesnt-out-clean-mouthwash-or-cure-all-you-1687355453" target=""&gt;It’s not particularly good at that job&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no reason to believe it will &lt;em&gt;do anything for your gut health or your abs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="chewing"&gt;Chewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another archaic one that keeps popping up. The idea of over-chewing your food always reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wmimhqPHkc" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;that scene in &lt;em&gt;The Road to Wellville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the dining hall erupts in a chorus of “Chew chew chew, that is the thing to do/Chew chew chew, good food is good for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, your mouth produces salivary amylase to help break down your food. But there is plenty of amylase in your small intestine as well. Studies have shown potential, subtle effects of extended chewing on satiety (how hungry you feel), but the idea that you’ll get a TikTok flat belly by spending more time chewing is unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

Chikungunya is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus and is spread by mosquitoes. File Photo courtesy the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;May 12 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; U.S. health officials are advising patients using the drug Ixchiq to hold off while authorities seek newer information on vaccine results in the global fight against chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pause for U.S. patients was initiated Friday by the FDA and CDC while the two federal agencies investigate "postmarketing reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, in individuals who have received the vaccine" Ixchiq, otherwise known as live "Chikungunya Vaccine," according to a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older" target="_blank"&gt;safety communication&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/" target="_blank" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="tpstyle"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2023/11/10/FDA-vaccine-chikungunya-virus/8071699627394/" target="_blank"&gt;approved Ixchiq for&lt;/a&gt; the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in patients age 18 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, health officials said the FDA will conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the use of Ixchiq in individuals 60 years of age and older after over 80,000 doses of Ixchiq were distributed worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this year, roughly 80,000 cases and 46 CHIKVD-related deaths have been reported in 14 countries or territories, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/chikungunya-monthly#:~:text=Twelve-month%20Chikungunya%20virus%20disease,population,%20April%202024-March%202025&amp;amp;text=1%20Apr%202025-,Since%20the%20beginning%20of%202025,%20and%20as%20of%20March,%20approximately,department%20and%20region%20of%20France)." target="_blank"&gt;says the&lt;/a&gt; EU-backed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA officials said as of Wednesday that 17 "serious adverse events" were reported globally in people over age 62 who got Ixchiq, with two reported deaths. Of the 17 reports, six were U.S.-based, but American health officials did not indicate if any of those deaths were in the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, officials pointed out that reported adverse events "may not be causally related to vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the symptoms &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;can last anywhere&lt;/a&gt; from one week to several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/06/25/cdc-health-advisory-dengue-fever/6631719366612/" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya virus causes high fever, rashes, headache and joint pain. And while most patients recover with days, the joint pain can persist for months that can be managed with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it has the potential to temporarily disable a victim, it does not often result in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single-dose shot approved November 2023 by the federal government was for use in adults with an increased risk of exposure to the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can infect people with Zika and chikungunya viruses at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/11/14/Mosquitoes-can-spread-Zika-Chikungunya-at-the-same-time/8681479181450/" target="_blank"&gt;research has suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and may &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/11/30/Mosquito-borne-chikungunya-may-cause-fatal-brain-infection/5381448917779/" target="_blank"&gt;cause fatal brain infection&lt;/a&gt; which hit 24 victims by November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/06/19/Georgia-woman-infected-with-chikungunya-virus-describes-pain/5711403179228/?spt=hn&amp;amp;or=1" target="_blank"&gt;observed and described in&lt;/a&gt; U.S. patients who traveled from the Caribbean area to Georgia and North Carolina as chikungunya &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2014/06/19/Mosquito-borne-virus-spreads-to-Cuba/7011403207907/" target="_blank"&gt;hit Cuba around&lt;/a&gt; May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya, an illness caused by a virus spread via mosquito bites but not by person-to-person contact, was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/05/02/Chikungunya-spreading-to-other-countries-in-the-Caribbean/4561399051386/" target="_blank"&gt;first detected in the&lt;/a&gt; Americas near the end of 2013 as it swiftly spread to other Caribbean nations, Africa and Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no cases have been reported on Europe's mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday's federal advisory on Ixchiq arrived amid a crackdown on vaccine use and its pertinent studies lead by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/29/robert-f-kennedy-confirmation-hearing/8251738077750/" target="_blank"&gt;known critic of&lt;/a&gt; effective and long-existing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In real-life analysis of 1,000 children under 16 with severe obesity over a number of years, about a quarter of patients in 2023 were given the weight loss drug liraglutide in

semaglutide but results from these children are not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Semaglutide, better known as Wegovy, and liraglutide, sold as Saxenda, are both GLP-1 receptor agonists, which help curb appetite. In the UK they are available on the NHS only for adults with a BMI above 35 with a weight-related condition, although in certain circumstances specialist paediatric clinics can prescribe them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Annika Janson, of Karolinska university hospital in Sweden, the lead author of the study, whose findings were presented at the European Congress on Obesity, said the beneficial impact of weight loss jabs on children’s weight could accelerate in future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Only a fraction of the children had GLP-1 drugs and most of those who did started on them six to 12 months into the treatment programme. Longer-term treatment may lead to greater improvements in BMI,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to helping to curb hunger, families reported reduced conflicts around food and improved capacity for other lifestyle adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It was . Portions could be downsized. For some children, not being hungry all the time is a new feeling,” Janson said. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are clearly beneficial to many children with severe obesity and, while they won’t help in all cases, more children should have access to these important medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;NHS England has announced it is rolling out “smart scales” that monitor children’s weight remotely in an attempt to “nudge” behaviour towards healthier eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Being overweight as a young child could double risk of adult obesity, research shows","elementId":"27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/being-overweight-as-a-young-child-could-double-risk-of-adult-obesity-research-shows"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 350 families are already using the technology in 15 &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/get-involved/cyp/specialist-clinics-for-children-and-young-people-living-with-obesity/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;specialist paediatric weight management clinics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Natural remedies for household &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/pests/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with pests"&gt;pests&lt;/a&gt; have gained popularity as homeowners seek alternatives to chemical repellents. Among these solutions, one Mediterranean plant stands out for its exceptional ability to ward off &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/flies/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with flies"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/summer/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with summer"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; months. This humble yet powerful herb offers an organic approach to pest control that’s both effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rue plant: the natural fly repellent from Mediterranean shores&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The common rue (Ruta graveolens), native to the Mediterranean basin, has become a valuable ally for those battling housefly invasions. This hardy perennial thrives in sunny, rocky terrain and has been cultivated for centuries not only for its medicinal properties but also for its remarkable insect-repelling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-734428905"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="3843226833" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes rue particularly effective against flies is its distinctive aroma. The plant contains powerful compounds including rutin and natural citronella that flies find deeply unpleasant. Strategically placing rue plants around entry points, windowsills, or outdoor dining areas creates a natural barrier that flies actively avoid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike chemical alternatives, rue offers a sustainable solution that requires minimal maintenance. The plant’s effectiveness complements other natural pest management approaches, such as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/14/my-neighbor-told-me-about-this-plant-that-he-placed-near-his-rose-bushes-to-keep-pests-away/"&gt;companion planting techniques that protect garden plants from common pests&lt;/a&gt;. Many gardeners discover that integrating rue into their landscape provides dual benefits of fly control and enhanced &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/garden/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with garden"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-443957131"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="9294255259" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-3723469720"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why flies become unbearable during summer months&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Summer’s warm temperatures create ideal breeding conditions for houseflies. A single female fly can lay over 500 eggs within days when conditions are favorable. These eggs are typically deposited in organic matter like food waste, improperly sealed garbage, or decaying vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of heat, humidity, and abundant food sources creates perfect conditions for explosive population growth. Within weeks, what started as a few harmless flies can become an overwhelming infestation that disrupts indoor comfort and outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond their nuisance factor, flies pose potential health concerns as they transfer bacteria between surfaces. This makes effective management even more important, especially during peak summer months when families spend more time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conventional repellents offer temporary relief, they often contain chemicals that raise environmental and health concerns. Natural alternatives like rue provide effective deterrence without these drawbacks, making them ideal for households with children, pets, or &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/10/04/why-you-absolutely-must-grow-this-little-known-but-essential-aromatic-plant-in-your-garden/"&gt;garden enthusiasts who value essential aromatic plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Growing and using rue for maximum effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it perfectly adapted to Mediterranean-like conditions. The plant requires minimal watering once established, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance similar to &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/23/plant-this-succulent-now-and-enjoy-a-sumptuous-flowerbed-until-the-first-frost/"&gt;certain succulents that provide beautiful blooms with minimal care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For fly deterrence, position potted rue plants near windows, doorways, and outdoor seating areas. The plant’s natural oils will create an invisible barrier that flies instinctively avoid. For enhanced effectiveness, gently brush the foliage occasionally to release more of its aromatic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s pest management benefits extend beyond flies. The plant also repels moths, mites, and aphids, making it a versatile addition to any garden. When incorporated into a comprehensive garden plan, rue can contribute to a &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/10/this-dense-plant-cover-turns-out-to-be-the-ideal-solution-against-the-proliferation-of-weeds/"&gt;healthier garden ecosystem that naturally suppresses weed growth&lt;/a&gt; and promotes beneficial insect populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ancient remedy with multiple benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s usefulness isn’t limited to pest control. For centuries, traditional medicine has valued this plant for its diverse therapeutic applications. In various cultures, rue has been used to aid digestion, support liver function, and relieve menstrual discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chilean health authorities recognize rue for its anti-parasitic properties and potential benefits for rheumatism relief. Some traditional practitioners even recommend it for skin conditions like eczema. While modern research continues to investigate these claims, rue’s historical significance in herbal medicine remains undisputed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its medicinal applications, rue serves as an excellent companion to other plants that require protection from summer pests. Its natural deterrent properties make it an ideal addition to gardens struggling with insect pressure, similar to how &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/03/say-goodbye-to-mosquitoes-this-summer-plant-this-herb-in-your-garden-now/"&gt;certain herbs can effectively repel mosquitoes throughout summer months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its combination of pest-repelling properties and minimal maintenance requirements, the Mediterranean rue offers an elegant solution to summer’s persistent fly problem. This forgotten plant deserves renewed attention from today’s gardeners seeking natural alternatives to chemical pest control.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study reveals that these anesthetics trigger a common signature: increased phase locking at low frequencies, particularly between brain hemispheres, while disrupting local cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that phase alignment—not just brain wave power—may be a universal marker of unconsciousness. Researchers propose that monitoring phase shifts could help anesthesiologists better tailor drug dosing in real time, regardless of which drug is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Both ketamine and dexmedetomidine produce similar brain wave phase shifts that correlate with unconsciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase Locking:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased interhemispheric phase alignment and disrupted local phase coherence may indicate loss of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Tracking brain wave phase could improve anesthetic monitoring and dosing in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the level of molecules and cells, ketamine and dexmedetomidine work very differently, but in the operating room they do the same exact thing: anesthetize the patient. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating how these distinct drugs achieve the same result, a new study in animals by neuroscientists at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT identifies a potential signature of unconsciousness that is readily measurable to improve anesthesiology care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109824"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and brain waves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the two drugs have in common, the researchers discovered, is the way they push around brain waves, which are produced by the collective electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves are in phase, meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned, local groups of neurons in the brain’s cortex can share information to produce conscious cognitive functions such as attention, perception and reasoning, said Picower Professor Earl K. Miller, senior author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves fall out of phase, local communications, and therefore functions, fall apart, producing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, led by graduate student Alexandra Bardon, not only adds to scientists’ understanding of the dividing line between consciousness and unconsciousness, Miller said, but also could provide a common new measure for anesthesiologists who use a variety of different anesthetics to maintain patients on the proper side of that line during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the way phase is shifted in our recordings, you can barely tell which drug it was,” said Miller, a faculty member in The Picower Institute and MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s valuable for medical practice.  Plus if unconsciousness has a universal signature, it could also reveal the mechanisms that generate consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more anesthetic drugs are also shown to affect phase in the same way, then anesthesiologists might be able to use brain wave phase alignment as a reliable marker of unconsciousness as they titrate doses of anesthetic drugs, Miller said, regardless of which particular mix of drugs they are using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could aid efforts to build closed-loop systems that can aid anesthesiologists by constantly adjusting drug dose based on brain wave measurements of the patient’s unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller has been collaborating with study co-author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute, on building such a system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent clinical trial with colleagues in Japan, Brown demonstrated that monitoring brain wave power signals using EEG enabled an anesthesiologist to use much less sevoflurane during surgery with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduced doses proved safe and were associated with many improved clinical outcomes including a reduced incidence of post-operative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists studying anesthesia have rarely paid attention to phase, but in the new study, Bardon, Brown and Miller’s team made a point of it as they anesthetized two animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals lost consciousness, the measurements indicated a substantial increase in “phase locking,” especially at low frequencies. Phase locking means that the relative differences in phase remained more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what caught the researchers’ attention were the differences that became locked in: Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, brain wave phase across hemispheres became more aligned, not less. But Miller notes that case is still a big shift from the conscious state, in which brain hemispheres are typically not aligned well, so the finding is a further indication that major changes of phase alignment, albeit in different ways at different distances, are a correlate of unconsciousness compared to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase in interhemispheric alignment of activity by anesthetics seems to reverse the pattern observed in the awake, cognitively engaged brain,” the Bardon and Miller team wrote in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determined by distance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance proved to be a major factor in determining the change in phase alignment. Even across the 2.5 millimeters of a single electrode array, low-frequency waves moved 20-30 degrees out of alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the 20 or so millimeters between arrays in the upper (dorsolateral) and lower (ventrolateral) regions within a hemisphere, that would mean a roughly 180-degree shift in phase alignment which is a complete offset of the waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dependence on distance is consistent with the idea of waves traveling across the cortex, Miller said. Indeed in a 2022 study, Miller and Brown’s labs showed that the anesthetic propofol induced a powerful low-frequency traveling wave that swept straight across the cortex, overwhelming higher-frequency straight and rotating waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results raise many opportunities for follow-up studies, Miller said. Does propofol (another anesthetic) also produce this signature of changed phase alignment? What role do traveling waves play in the phenomenon?

Neighboring prefrontal subregions within a hemisphere show decreased phase alignment with both drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local analyses within a region suggest that this finding could be explained by broad cortical distance-based effects, such as large traveling waves. In contrast, homologous areas across hemispheres become more aligned in phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that both anesthetics induce strong patterns of cortical phase alignment that are markedly different from those during waking and that these patterns may be a common feature driving loss of responsiveness from different anesthetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:51:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBIeS1uOGROYnZRVFdKYW9UZjc5UVZULVpvUmI1SDNzaHFwMm91S0pCamV5T2dEcnZjRGFPc1ZWSFNTUzR2MUZOMDhsWERVQVpNdUxIeHhjeFgwUV90R3U3XzRadm9OWmdsWTBRbA</guid></item><item><title>“我们在莱姆中心” ：马里兰州兽医警告宠物主人蜱虫的威胁- WTOP | ‘We’re in Lyme central’: Maryland veterinarian warns pet owners about the threat of ticks - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxON0tXTkwtMmlFV0MtaXE2NXE3aHNCemZ6NDJWTFgxanVSbnNKeENndDlOdl91VzMtdjJCXzNMalpsU1RvUXNTeDh0YUZZR3BNVVl4NngzR05rNk5UNHE2cWNFZlVFNlVRTVlvc0p2V25uWE5aRlh2ZXo2NnNyYmZ5ZjNBb2lyUldfZGVtdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;As the weather turns warmer a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather turns warmer, a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people think of the spring and summer as tick season, a Maryland-based veterinarian said he sees more ticks in the fall months of October, November and December than he does in July and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ticks come out all year round,” said Dr. Victor Katz, of &lt;a href="https://www.mbvets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Muddy Branch Veterinary Center&lt;/a&gt; in Gaithersburg. “If it gets to 32 degrees frost, they might be a little dormant, but as soon as it warms up to 35-37 degrees, they start moving around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dog’s ambient temperature is 101 degrees. Ticks want to be warm and can sense temperature, humidity and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They basically hatch out and basically attach to the dogs. They just want to be warm,” Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tick-related diseases prevalent in the D.C. region, including Lyme, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They moved the epicenter for studying Lyme disease from Hartford, Connecticut, to Derwood, Maryland, about seven years ago,” Katz said. “We are in ‘Lyme central.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz pointed to monthly oral preventive medication, such as Simparica, Bravecto and NexGard, as the best way to keep your dogs safe from tick borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not put a bubble around the dog where it basically shoots the tick with laser beams or something like that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a tick bites a dog that’s on an oral preventive, it will die in about four to six hours. Transmission of some of these diseases often takes up to 10 to 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s basically wiping the tick out before they get a chance to transmit enough of the disease to harm the dog,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is data, according to Katz, that shows the preventatives might increase seizure potential in some dogs. He recommended for those dogs, using a Seresto tick collar that lasts about six months and, he said, “works really well.”&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding this neural link could inform individualized treatment approaches that address both the psychiatric condition and sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSTC Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Dysregulation in the CSTC circuit may underlie both sleep and psychiatric symptoms in OCSDs, CTDs, and ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bidirectional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep can worsen CSTC symptoms, while CSTC disorders themselves disrupt sleep architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; SSRIs can treat core symptoms but may disrupt REM sleep, emphasizing the need for sleep-aware pharmacological choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sleep difficulties in patients with obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSDs), chronic tic disorders (CTDs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are likely due to disruptions in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway, according to a narrative review in the May issue of &lt;em&gt;Harvard Review of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret D. Hall at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Erica Greenberg, MD and Kevin Gipson, MD, MS, at Massachusetts General Hospital, and colleagues also report evidence that dopamine and GABA—primary neurotransmitters in CSTC circuitry—are dysregulated in patients with these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how CSTC dysregulation relates to sleep disorders could lead to more effective treatments, the reviewers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review also confirms subjective reports of poor sleep and insomnia with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers used PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to search for relevant English-language articles published before August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They defined OCSDs as including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) disorders, and hoarding disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tic disorders include Tourette syndrome and chronic/persistent motor or vocal tic disorder. The team identified 42 papers: 23 on OCSDs, eight on CTDs, 10 on ADHD, and one on both CTDs and ADHD. They refer to these disorders collectively as CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-occurring objective sleep movement disorders were consistently reported in adults with CTDs or OCD, and similar subjective findings were documented for children with OCD, ADHD, or CTDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only a small number of studies included polysomnographic data, there was evidence of a sleep disturbance pattern with OCD, BFRB disorders, and CTDs. Subjective sleep latency problems and objective sleep spindle disruption were both common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence reviewed in this paper supports a bidirectional, additive increase in sleep and CSTC-condition symptoms,” the reviewers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to evidence that disordered sleep may be intrinsic to these CSTC-conditions, poor sleep can also impair functional connectivity and may result in structural changes in the fronto-striatal circuitry, likely further exacerbating CSTC-condition symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining treatments for sleep-related complaints in patients with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three potential approaches to treating sleep disturbances in patients with CSTC-conditions, the team notes: (1) treatment of the condition, which may indirectly treat sleep-related concerns; (2) treatment of sleep, which may indirectly treat symptoms of the CSTC-condition; and (3) treatment of both approaches simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective approach, however, may differ from person to person, contingent on the specific condition(s) and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers say careful treatment selection is particularly important for children taking medication for CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians must weigh “the potential long-term effects of an altered sleep architecture against the substantial risks of untreated psychopathology, which comes with its own significant sequelae,” they emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying medications that mitigate core symptoms while stabilizing or improving sleep architecture, as opposed to exacerbating existing sleep disturbances, is a critical avenue for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, the reviewers cite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medications are the first-line treatment for OCD and BDD, but they delay the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decrease the proportion of time spent in REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to understand if the degree to which an SSRI is helpful in treating OCD symptoms is moderated by its (positive or negative) impact on sleep architecture,” the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, it will be important to explore whether these SSRI-associated sleep-related atypicalities are solely secondary to the SSRI, or perhaps would have been likely to emerge independently and secondary to the CSTC-condition itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b3b6aab1acb8f7bdbcaaadbcbfb8b7b699aeb6b5adbcabaab2b5acaebcabf7bab6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Josh DeStefano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolterskluwer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Josh DeStefano – Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/abstract/2025/05000/disrupted_cortico_striato_thalamo_cortical.2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disrupted Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical Circuitry and Sleep Disturbances in Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Chronic Tic, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Margaret D.

Unfortunately, much of the current research to date has not employed polysomnographic methods for objective sleep-related assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should further clarify the neural association between these neuropsychiatric conditions and sleep disturbances to better guide potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the most effective treatments for subjective sleep-related complaints in patients with these conditions will be crucial, particularly for determining treatment course—whether to prioritize treatment of the underlying condition, the specific sleep symptoms, or both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:31:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5VNHg1V1FubkcwR1k0R0NRUFFWN3FsX1VYZF9kb3phWTEwb1Z2ZnktOFBPWVpRTF92aWxaU1IzaHlTQXRWRlhua01LT1doNm9MeVphYjFwSHd2WFhfS0JV</guid></item><item><title>维京DNA有助于揭示何时出现抗HIV基因突变： 9000年前在黑海附近- Live Science | Viking DNA helps reveal when HIV-fighting gene mutation emerged: 9,000 years ago near the Black Sea - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOYm40cEdPcEQ2QWdBYjRVZVhBNEg2d3ZqMk5pTDI0ZEpvWV9CTF9xRUNWOGVPaFNSWGlJU0l4SXh5T3NzSGNINm9qZnV2ZTBZN290VWFxeWpOaEFrNDZ3ekNWOGJQZ29DWEU1azN4VHpMS0FleUlJSk1lcXQ3aFA1U0hHMl94NjN5LW42dTZMQWQyMi1jX202R0JJTzJUUmxNaWNQbDNMcEs4QjQ0RFQ0dlN6WFB3OGNTN1JqYURoWWNwNkNVV2VhRVhpcjNNbTkyVklmcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gene variant that helps protect people from HIV infection likely originated in people who lived during the span of time between the Stone Age and the Viking Age, a new study of thousands of genomes reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out that the variant arose in one individual who lived in an area near the Black Sea between 6,700 and 9,000 years ago," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simon Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioinformatics expert at the University of Copenhagen and co-senior author of the study, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

However, attempts to identify its origin and trace its spread have previously come up short, since ancient genomes are often extremely fragmentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the research team identified the mutation in 2,504 genomes from modern humans sampled for the 1000 Genomes Project, an international effort to catalog human genetic variation. Then, they created a model to search 934 ancient genomes from various regions of Eurasia ranging from the early Mesolithic period to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Viking Age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from roughly 8000 B.C. to A.D. 1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By looking at this large dataset, we can determine where and when the mutation arose," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kirstine Ravn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's genetic detective work revealed that the person who first carried this mutation lived near the Black Sea around 7000 B.C., around the time &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early farmers arrived in Europe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via Western Asia. The researchers also discovered that the prevalence of the mutation exploded between 8,000 and 2,000 years ago, suggesting it was extremely useful as people moved out of the Eurasian steppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings contradict previous assumptions that the mutation emerged more recently. For instance, this means that the increase in the frequency of the mutation did not result from medieval plagues or from Viking exploration, which may have introduced pressure for humans' immune cells to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it's not being ransacked by HIV, the CCR5 protein helps control how immune cells &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;respond to signals called chemokines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, likely helping direct cells to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sites of inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that people who carried the special CCR5 variant had an advantage. "People with this mutation were better at surviving, likely because it dampened the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immune system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a time when humans were exposed to new pathogens," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leonardo Cobuccio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement.

A new review reveals how each hemisphere processes the opposite side of your field of vision, not only early on but even in higher-level cognition like attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separation gives us a “bilateral advantage,” increasing our capacity to track multiple objects across the visual field. The brain seamlessly coordinates the handoff of information between hemispheres, avoiding confusion as objects move across our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilateral Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing visual input across both hemispheres improves object-tracking capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial-Only Split:&lt;/strong&gt; The hemispheric divide applies to spatial info, not features like color or shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain hemispheres “handoff” visual targets like cell towers switching a call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People have a lot of misconceptions about what the brain’s left and right hemispheres do, but one well-known aspect of this division may be even more true than people realize: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain not only splits up visual spatial perception—processing what’s on our left in the right hemisphere and what’s on our right in the left hemisphere—it takes cognitive advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="The Brain’s Hemispheres and the Architecture of Perception" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvTmM9h15yg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new review by MIT neuroscientists explains what the field has learned about this division of labor, the trade-off it involves and how the brain ultimately bridges the divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People hear all these myths about the left brain being more analytical and the right brain being more artistic, or people being right-brained vs left-brained. Ninety-nine percent of that is nonsense,” said paper co-author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You think with your whole brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to visual spatial perception, the brain has evolved separate neural resources for the right vs left sides of gaze even in later stages of cognitive processing, Miller said. Why? To optimize its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for good reason,” said Miller, who co-authored the new review in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia &lt;/em&gt;with Picower Institute research scientist Scott Brincat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perceptual capacity is limited—you can only take in so much at once. If you’re your capacity is fully tied up on the right side of your gaze, you might miss a threat approaching on the left. Splitting resources between both sides helps avoid dangerous perceptual blind spots”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separated sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Miller was in graduate school, he said, he was taught that the brain neatly divided its visual perception of space between hemispheres until the information reached the prefrontal cortex where it became seamlessly blended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experiments by Miller and Brincat, as well as many other researchers, have been accumulating evidence to refine that view over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have shown that even in the prefrontal cortex, neural encoding of information about where an object is, is still biased toward the “contralateral” hemisphere, or the hemisphere opposite of where the object appears in the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, the two hemispheres appear to function surprisingly independently, even for high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is apparent in measurements of the brain waves produced by coordinated networks of neurons in each hemisphere. Gamma frequency wave power increases in frontal brain hemispheres when they consider the visual stimuli that appear on the contralateral side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, studies for decades (including one in 1971) have shown that people and animals can remember more things if their presentation is split between hemispheres rather than presented all on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists call this the “bilateral advantage,” though it is not perfect. People don’t track multiple things, even if split across both sides, as well as they track just one thing on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also exhibit individualized differences in perceptual capacity across the visual field. Miller has founded the startup company SplitSage to measure these differences with the goal of helping people with visually oriented complex tasks to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the studies that Brincat and Miller review in the new paper show that the split bias between hemispheres applies only to spatial information—the &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; something is. Other features like color or shape are processed by both hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the brain maintains a separation in its processing of spatial visual perception, even at the stage of allocating attention and juggling objects in working memory, why aren’t we confused or surprised when a bird flying from our left passes into the right side of our field of view? We also easily handle cases where our shifting gaze moves an object from one eye’s field of view to the other’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We experience a seamless world,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the brain accomplishes the “handoff” from one hemisphere to the other much like two cellular towers do for your phone as you drive around, according to neural activity measurements in studies such as one in 2014 and one that Brincat and Miller led in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a tracked target approaches the visual midline, the hemisphere about to receive the target shows a ramp-up of activity well before the crossing time, as if it is anticipating the target,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, activity in the sending hemisphere remains high well after the crossing. Thus, for up to a second or more, neural signals reflecting the target are shared across both hemispheres. It is as if both hemispheres are holding the baton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the “bilateral advantage,” there is a small performance cost when this transfer happens, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in interhemispheric connectivity or synchrony are apparent in neurological and psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders, the authors note. Brincat and Miller’s review emphasizes that such disruptions could affect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A foundational understanding of interhemispheric processing, combined with interventions translatable to human patients offers hope for developing novel network-level treatments,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#640005120d000e0b24090d104a010011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Brincat et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two cerebral hemispheres can often operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interactions between them are critical for cognition and have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological studies have long focused on a single hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we review recent studies showing neurophysiological evidence showing both independence and interactions between the hemispheres during complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:08:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1qNjFLZzF3am92Z2JKQmdiQkZ0cXZJVWFoclRwdTZYT2VsMVktanU5SWZnWnhpZXN2eWZJNHZlM2JoOHJMZlUtZlYwSWxLVEtBYzk0WUdsbW12UEdsTnpRei1nQTFsLWNwTnpVX1p5QW0</guid></item><item><title>加拉廷县麻疹病例更新- KBZK新闻 | Gallatin County measles cases update - KBZK News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBOdU9RY1lBSXctaXJnUy1mNF90OHlNZnVjNGxibVc3YVdtSWhqeW5wSWlrRmFKMkt2bUFQa2c3TUY5eDhkLUlrYjhFLTM1Y3NybG5ncEZ1aFlvNlpxZ1NYZWlnNUgwLXZXMlZLbTlDeGZ2RXZldG9hZTBCUFFEZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOZEMAN—The Gallatin City-County Health Department reported today that all eight cases of measles reported in April have recovered, and the individuals are no longer isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch how health officials responded to measles cases confirmed in Gallatin County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

It has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants, all healthcare workers, were asked to assess self-reported COVID-19–attributed symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Results were compared with COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and with non-COVID controls (uninfected participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all online respondents, 17.0% said they had experienced persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infections, similar to the 15.9% of telephone respondents. Forty-three percent of respondents with long COVID said their case was moderate, and 33% classified their long COVID as severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms among those with long COVID were fatigue, shortness of breath, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise, and smell or taste disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk 15% after first infection, 6% after second&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative risk of long COVID increased with the number of reported COVID-19 infections, rising from 13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.1% to 14.4%) for a single infection to 37.0% (95% CI, 33.0% to 40.9%) for three infections in the online survey, and from 11.8% (a single infection) to 29.5% (≥3 infections) in the telephone survey, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With both surveys combined, the risk of long COVID was two to three times higher after the initial infection (14.8%) than after first (5.8%) or second (5.3%) reinfections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms were reported 5 to 22 times more often by long COVID cases than by COVID controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Severe symptoms were reported 5 to 22 times more often by long COVID cases than by COVID controls, except for fever, cough, insomnia, anxiety, and depression (2.7 to 4.5 times)," the authors wrote.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk for long COVID was highest following infections with the ancestral strain and lowest after Omicron infections. However, because Omicron caused such widespread transmission, that strain was associated with the most long-COVID cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study indicates that long COVID risk is roughly two thirds lower following reinfection compared to first infection," the authors said. "This may be partly related to greater host-specific resistance among individuals who did not have long COVID following their first episode."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual flu shots could become a thing of the past under a new vaccine strategy developed and tested by University of Nebraska–Lincoln virologist Eric Weaver and his laboratory team.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Research findings &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59182-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; reveal a possible breakthrough. The study, "Epitope-Optimized Vaccine Elicits Cross-Species Immunity Against Influenza A Virus," describes a vaccine that protects against H1N1 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/swine+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; and can also protect against influenza in humans and birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research sets the stage for developing universal influenza vaccines so people won't have to go to the doctor and get a flu shot every year," Weaver said. "This vaccine will protect you against the different strains that are out there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swine vaccinated with the immunogens designed in Weaver's laboratory exhibited no signs of illness after being exposed to a commonly circulating flu strain; developed antibodies against a multitude of viruses from several decades and multiple species; and maintained their immune response throughout the six-month &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/longitudinal+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-experiment &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/regression+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;regression analysis&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the immunity would not dissipate for a decade, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Epigraph vaccine, named after the computer software used to design it, significantly outperformed a commercial vaccine used by the pork industry and a "wild type" vaccine based on naturally occurring strains with similar immunogens.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The newly published results confirm previous research that demonstrated the vaccine design protected against the H3 influenza subtype. The new results are particularly encouraging, Weaver said, because H1 swine flu variants are detected twice as often as H3 variants—and have nearly three times more genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This H1 subtype is the largest and most genetically diverse subtype in pigs," Weaver said. "It's also among the viruses that jumped from swine to humans to cause the 2009 swine flu pandemic. It's a big target and one of the harder targets to hit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza A virus regularly infects as much as 15% of the human population and causes thousands of deaths each year. Current vaccines often fail to provide long-lasting protection because of the genetic diversity and rapid mutation of proteins that help form the virus. The H1 and H3 subtypes, for example, reflect different mutations of hemagglutinin, the molecules of protein and carbohydrate that coat the surface of a virus and enable it to infiltrate the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge in controlling influenza is that it infects multiple species: birds, swine, horses and dogs, along with humans. Swine often act as a mixing vessel because they are susceptible to human and bird flu variants, contributing to the evolution of novel forms of the disease that can be transmitted back to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 swine flu pandemic, for example, resulted from a zoonotic transmission from hogs to humans. About 25% of the human population was infected with the new variant and more than half a million people died from it in the first year, according to some estimates. The 1918 Spanish Flu, 1957 Asian Flu and 1968 Hong Kong Flu pandemics also resulted from cross-species transmission to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"If we can prevent influenza in swine, we can also prevent zoonotic jumps from avians to swine to humans, or from swine directly to humans. We could basically cut off this evolutionary arsenal or advantage that the virus has," Weaver explained. "The ultimate goal is to eliminate or eradicate influenza."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaver's vaccine strategy, which has been patented, used the Epigraph software to analyze the genetic codes of more than 6,000 strains of influenza virus occurring from 1930 to 2021 and create a vaccine cocktail representing their most common epitopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epitopes are regions on a virus that trigger the immune system to produce antibodies to neutralize the virus and to send T-cells to destroy infected cells. As the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; evolves, some epitopes disappear, thus evading the immune response. The computationally derived Epigraph strategy increases the likelihood that the vaccine contains the epitopes needed to trigger an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt; and prevent illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data analysis showed the vaccines provided protection for human influenza varieties that emerged during the last 20 years and for swine influenza varieties that emerged over the past century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's an incredibly powerful thing," Weaver said. "The ultimate goal would be to have a significant impact on the disease burden in our society."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Weaver said he believes vaccine science is on the precipice of a major leap forward, thanks in part to improvements in gene sequencing technology and databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our ability to understand how viruses evolve has increased exponentially in the past 20 years," he said. "What I see on the horizon is a third wave, where we go from good vaccines to universal lifelong vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the swine study, four groups of five pigs were vaccinated with Epigraph, wild type, commercial or sham vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional antibodies were measured against four swine flu clades, including the 2009 swine flu pandemic variant, two representative human H1N1 strains from the 2009 pandemic and a representative bird flu strain. Epigraph-vaccinated pigs reached threshold immunity levels for all 12 strains tested, while wild type-vaccinated pigs showed immunity against eight of 12 strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercially vaccinated pigs had antibody responses three to five times lower than those observed in the Epigraph and wild type-vaccinated pigs, reaching threshold levels in only six of 12 strains tested. Importantly, the swine study also showed that the Epigraph vaccine induced significantly higher T-cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps include testing a vaccine to protect against both H1 and H3 strains of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;. Weaver hopes eventually to form a partnership with a biotechnology company to pursue a human vaccine. Although the results so far have been gratifying, Weaver said he is eager to see if other scientists confirm his results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We do the most stringent controls that we can possibly do, because we want to be absolutely certain—and I have no doubt that this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is better than the current vaccines," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/migraine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;migraine&lt;/a&gt; research has focused on treating headaches, no treatments have shown efficacy in alleviating early premonitory symptoms that often last for hours and can cause considerable dysfunction for people with migraine. Ubrogepant is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; that blocks the CGRP receptor on neurons, which are responsible for the transmission of pain, but its potential ability to treat premonitory symptoms of migraine had been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Goadsby and colleagues analyzed the effectiveness of ubrogepant as a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; for premonitory symptoms in 438 participants 18–75 years of age with at least a one-year history of migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into two groups for a double-blind study, and took a 100-milligram dose of either ubrogepant or a placebo once initial premonitory symptoms started, during which the participant was confident a headache would follow within one to six hours. During a second prodromal event at least seven days later, participants took the opposite treatment (ubrogepant or placebo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goadsby and colleagues found that when participants received ubrogepant, they self-reported improvements in their ability to concentrate one hour after treatment, reduced sensitivity to light two hours after treatment, and reduced fatigue and neck pain after three hours, compared with the placebo-treated group. Dizziness and sensitivity to sound symptoms were also reduced in ubrogepant-treated participants between four and 24 hours after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that ubrogepant may be an effective treatment for common premonitory symptoms, with improvements beginning possibly as early as one hour after dosing. However, additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on prodromal symptoms are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Or wondered if you need to get this probably minor thing checked out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our modern lives of overworking, poor sleep routines and general life stress all exacerbate a wide variety of &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are some things that, though seemingly small, may require a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Dr Lori Solomon, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at New York Medical College, and Dr Estelle Williams, ​​medical director for CityMD for the southern New Jersey region to get their thoughts on which symptoms should really not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going to the bathroom too frequently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up in the middle of the night needing to pee is totally normal, Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt; But if that’s something you’re doing two or three times per night – every night – that might be indicative of a more serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-frequent urination can be a &lt;a href="/topic/symptom"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “When your sugar is high, one of the ways the body tries to get rid of the sugar, is to get rid of it through the urine,” Soloman says. “During the day, you just go to the bathroom more often, but at nighttime, you often have to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eGgKya"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-36957"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that other worrying signs can be feeling more thirsty and a significant increase in appetite. “Those are the types of things I think need to be checked sooner rather than later,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any pain that wakes you up during the night could be a problem. While pulled muscles, physical injuries, or other discomforts may hinder someone getting to sleep – they shouldn’t be disturbing you once you’re asleep, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're waking up in the middle of the night with a headache, you've got a problem… because usually we don't wake up with headaches in the middle of the night,” she says. “If that's waking you up at night – I'm a little bit more worried about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headaches are “super common,” and shouldn’t necessarily be considered worrisome, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if a headache is accompanied by other things such as vision changes, nausea tingling in the extremities, weakness – those may be a sign that something neurological is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams cautions those who jump to label sudden, severe headaches as &lt;a href="/topic/migraines"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. “A migraine is actually a very specific &lt;a href="/topic/diagnosis"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and headache pattern, requiring neurologic evaluation,” she says. “It's good that you get evaluated if you're having a headache that's unusual for you, if it’s very intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 jIjruH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Headaches are super common, but if you’re experiencing extra symptoms including nausea, vision changes or weakness this can be a sign of something else.

I was just doing my regular activities and I became very winded and short of breath,’ get that checked,” she says. “I would also say, if you take a deep breath and you develop pain in your chest or your back that you've never had before, that can sometimes be a soft sign for a &lt;a href="/topic/blood-clot"&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism, that we certainly want to see for sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/fatigue"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; too – while common in many people due to hectic work schedules or other lifestyle commitments – should not be significantly interfering with things you would do day-to-day such as exercising, Solomon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very severe cases, fatigue can be symptomatic of &lt;a href="/topic/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea, and even some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one less obvious and very typical symptom of heart disease. “It's very common for people who are having a &lt;a href="/topic/heart-attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to think they're having indigestion,” Solomon says. “If you’re taking a walk and all of a sudden you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got some indigestion’, and then it gets better when you stop walking, that's your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fatigue and indigestion, unconnected to a big meal, is something that people should see the doctor about, she says. It could be due to a lack of blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says that bouts of indigestion-like symptoms – pressure or tightness – that last for 15 minutes or 20 minutes can be telling, especially for those who do not typically suffer from indigestion or heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people think ‘Oh, I just ate something weird, and I must have a bubble of gas in my chest,” she says. “That sensation of indigestion is something that can be an indicator of heart disease… It can be a masker of something more serious.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in your stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your bowels, says Williams, because being constipated or having diarrhea is something that's different is worth getting checked out. And while it may seem obvious, seeing blood in either your poop or pee is definitely something to see a doctor about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having a change of bowel habits – if you see black stool or a lot of blood when you’re using the restroom, I feel like that's perhaps not a subtle sign,” William says. “That's something a little more concerning that means you should come in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often associate blood in the stool as a hemorrhoid, but should not be ignored as it can be a common presentation for &lt;a href="/topic/colon-cancer"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general you generally don't want to see blood in the urine either,” she says. “But that's usually &lt;a href="/topic/kidney-stones"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; or urinary tract infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon also warns people to pay attention when things just don’t clear up on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there's a cough lasting more than four weeks, you generally want to see somebody about that,” Solomon says. “There's lots of reasons you can have a cough, but generally, if you have a cough after a cold, it generally goes away in a few weeks. So if it lasts longer than a month, we generally want to know about that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that things that have been happening for months that may seem innocuous may still be worth investigating. Losing weight unintentionally is definitely something worth mentioning to your primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 ccMPxj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="There are many reasons that a person can get a cough, though most generally go away in a week or so following a cold.

&lt;p&gt;Dry eye disease, which occurs when tears are unable to adequately lubricate the eyes, is a common symptom of not only Sjögren’s but a number of other conditions, the researchers noted. Here, the use of eye drops with MSCs was tested in a study in China involving patients with and without Sjögren’s whose symptoms did not respond to other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, per the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have demonstrated that MSC eye drops might offer clinical efficacy and manageable safety in treating refractory [dry eye disease] for the first time, potentially bringing a new perspective on the treatment of such patients,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial findings were detailed in “&lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04292-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A first-in-human, prospective pilot trial of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell eye drops therapy for patients with refractory non-Sjögren’s and Sjögren’s syndrome dry eye disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Testing eye drops containing mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of dry eye disease can include eye irritation and dryness, blurred vision, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eyes. Sjögren’s, a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the glands that produce tears and saliva, is a common cause of dry eye disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatments such as artificial tears, topical corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapies are available. However, the researchers noted, their efficacy “varies significantly among individuals,” and can “[cause] sight-threatening side effects,” with the outcomes for patients “often falling short of satisfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a team from the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School at Nanjing University sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MSC eye drops in adults with dry eye disease who did not respond to current treatments; these patients were considered to have refractory dry eye disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type of stem cells, MSCs can grow and give rise to other cell types in the body, such as those making up muscles, bones, cartilage, and fat. These cells can be isolated from several tissues, as well, including fat, bone marrow, and the umbilical cord. MSCs also can influence the activity of other cells, most notably immune cells, by releasing certain signaling molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted an open-label clinical trial (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05784519"&gt;NCT05784519&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojEN.html?proj=165917"&gt;ChiCTR2200058115&lt;/a&gt;) testing the stem cell eye drops in these patients, with follow-up at four weeks, or at about one month, and at one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This clinical trial represents a groundbreaking exploration into the preliminary therapeutic potential and safety of umbilical cord MSC eye drops for patients with refractory [dry eye disease],” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five study participants had been &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosed with Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, and 11 had dry eye disease but didn’t have Sjögren’s. All received eye drops with MSCs isolated from the umbilical cord, given twice daily for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;This clinical trial represents a groundbreaking exploration into the preliminary therapeutic potential and safety of umbilical cord MSC eye drops for patients with refractory [or hard-to-treat dry eye disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers used OSDI, or ocular surface disease index, scores as a patient-reported measure of eye discomfort. Tcorneal fluorescein staining (CFS) scores were used for evaluating eye surface damage. Additional assessments for tear quality and quantity included the Schirmer I test (SIT), tear meniscus height (TMH), and noninvasive break-up time (NIBUT), which measures the stability of the tear film on the eye’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the MSC eye drops significantly eased most signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in patients with and without Sjögren’s at four weeks, per the researchers. Benefits were particularly seen in terms of tear production, as measured by SIT and TMH, and reduced eye surface damage, as measured by CFS. Average NIBUT scores and self-reported OSDI scores also improved, but reached statistical significance only in patients without Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements across all measures were also seen one year after treatment in the group of patients who did not have Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Analyses suggest drops work by reducing inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed the function of the meibomian glands, which produce a fat-like substance that overlays the eye surface to prevent tear film evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At four weeks, the MSC eye drops had significantly enhanced the protective fatty layer and reduced meibomian gland obstruction in both patient groups, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of tears before and after treatment, the stem cell eye drops significantly reduced the levels of two pro-inflammatory immune signaling proteins, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-17A, in all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients without Sjögren’s, those with the disease had significantly lower levels of MUC5AC before treatment. MUC5AC is a protein found in human tear film that helps maintain eye surface lubrication. After treatment, the levels of MUC5AC rose significantly in Sjögren’s patients, per the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analyses suggested that MSC eye drops worked by reducing inflammation caused by a type of immune cell called Th17 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some patients experienced treatment-related adverse reactions, most were mild in severity and had a minimal impact on daily life. The most frequently reported adverse events were eye surface discomfort, such as foreign body sensation and stinging eye pain, all of which resolved within two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study validated that the treatment of refractory [non-Sjögren’s dry eye] and [Sjögren’s dry eye] patients with MSC eye drops is a feasible and safe application method, particularly showing good and enduring efficacy for tear deficiency and meibomian gland blockage,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted the small trial size as a key limitation of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To further validate the therapeutic efficacy and explore the underlying mechanisms of treatment, it is necessary to conduct randomized controlled clinical trials with a larger sample size and an extended follow-up period,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIG HARBOR, Wash. — The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department is investigating a suspected norovirus outbreak that sickened dozens of students and staff at a Gig Harbor elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple students at Discovery Elementary School in Gig Harbor showed signs of gastroenteritis on Thursday, according to the Peninsula School District. Staff sent the ill students home and notified the health department when the number of absences reached the reporting threshold.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 students were absent or sent home on Friday, the district said. Staff were also affected by the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Norovirus&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s spread through direct contact with an infected person, eating or drinking contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department is still investigating the cause of the outbreak, although it determined the school kitchen was not the source, according to the school district.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precaution, the school kitchen was temporarily closed to be sanitized. Meals will be prepared at another school, and bag lunches will be served at Discovery Elementary on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen staff must remain symptom-free for 48 hours before the kitchen can reopen, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district said it implemented enhanced cleaning protocols throughout the building and scheduled restrooms to be periodically closed during the school day for extra cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department recommended that students and staff should stay home until they have been symptom-free for 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with norovirus will develop symptoms within 12 to 48 hours of being exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norovirus can be prevented by washing your hands often, cooking shellfish thoroughly, washing fruits and vegetables, disinfecting surfaces and staying home if symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The research was led by a team of scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;, who constructed FaceAge, an AI tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts trained the tool on almost 60,000 images of healthy individuals and then tested it on more than 6,000 patients who were starting radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the typical cancer patient appeared about five years older than their birth certificate suggested, and that each additional year shortened their life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-selfie-to-biomarker"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From selfie to biomarker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge is a deep-learning network. It studies fine details – skin texture, muscle tone, and eye shape – then translates those patterns into a single number: your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-biological-age-may-predict-dementia-risk-better-than-birth-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process is automatic. If FaceAge receives a head-and-shoulders photo, it can predict an age that reflects the body’s wear and tear better than the chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How old a person seems has long guided doctors informally. Frail features can steer therapy toward gentler options; youthful vigor can justify aggressive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such judgments are subjective. FaceAge puts a more objective figure on that impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-face-age-and-cancer-prediction"&gt;AI, face age, and cancer prediction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, patients whose biological age topped 85 fared worst, even after the authors adjusted for sex, tumor site, and chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person’s biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful,” said Hugo Aerts, the director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work demonstrates that a photo, like a simple selfie, contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters – individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faceage-captures-hidden-signals"&gt;FaceAge captures hidden signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting how long a terminal patient has left is difficult. The researchers asked ten clinicians and scientists to view one hundred portraits of people who were receiving palliative radiotherapy, and to guess whether each person would be alive within months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when the panel knew chronological age and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-thrives-on-human-stress-as-it-spreads-throughout-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; type, their accuracy barely beat chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding FaceAge shifted the odds. With the AI number in hand, the group’s predictions improved markedly, suggesting FaceAge captures hidden signals that physicians miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-ai-to-see-face-age"&gt;Teaching AI to see face age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators began with public image banks that held 58,851 faces, each tagged with an age. Those photos came from everyday contexts, so the network first learned to recognize normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next the team applied FaceAge to clinical snapshots taken during routine treatment setup. Linking those pictures to medical records let the algorithm discover how appearance, disease, and outcome connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge still needs validation in larger and more diverse populations. The study cohort came from only two centers, and lighting or camera angles could skew results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmetic surgery, heavy makeup, or cultural differences in skin care might also confuse the model. The team plans to follow patients over time to see whether the FaceAge number changes as therapy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-early-detection-system"&gt;An early detection system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age,” said co-senior author Ray Mak, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual’s aging trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge illustrates how artificial intelligence can turn everyday data into medical guidance. A single selfie may soon complement blood tests and scans, giving oncologists a faster, less biased picture of a patient’s resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If further trials confirm the findings, clinics could upload photos and receive instantaneous biological age estimates that fine-tune treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faceage-beyond-cancer-care"&gt;FaceAge: Beyond cancer care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging underlies &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, dementia, and more. An image-based biomarker could therefore aid many specialties by identifying people who need lifestyle changes or preventive therapy years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key will be strict oversight. Algorithms trained on limited datasets risk embedding bias, and patient consent will be vital when personal images feed predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, FaceAge remains a research AI tool. Yet its promise is clear: the face you present to the camera may hold clues to how your body is coping with illness and time. Harnessed responsibly, that knowledge could guide decisions that extend life and improve its quality – one snapshot at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589750025000421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:52:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOVVk2VDdza1QtZEd0SHpOck94ZDVTSDdRZFZvS2luVEZLY2tmVzMxYlZqWE5TMVlhUjlHOWh4eldhSGl6Wkw5WUl2SGpSOWV2LUJwR3dpbEpLSUxFMEJVX0d3NHNkeDVNcDFlZDd0bDVvWVdHaThweGFrTlJYM3FWR1d3</guid></item><item><title>人工智能如何改善帕金森的护理-《今日帕金森新闻》 | How artificial intelligence could improve Parkinson’s care - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQN2VJT3ZoX1FVMXRDc3g4al9ET3UwdWtiT3BxckNGS1Z6RWJnVUQtb0IwZkxpUmNtYlBId3Y4U1NKVEJaMmFwZEZmMUI5WnE0TGhqTlZ4M0ZVam5NVGlZV2ZEM1dzV1Y1dmgzZ1hKaWtrYjJycGFBOVBOMjFhVHp5MFpoNW5uSWtCTkpmV1JyYk5kTm9rbGloMjdNZEVZLXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence, or AI, is everywhere today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; is good at taking large amounts of information and finding patterns in it. It’s also good at filling in gaps — sometimes with accurate information and sometimes with things &lt;a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/"&gt;it makes up&lt;/a&gt;! That’s why AI must always be used in concert with human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, its ability to recognize similarities and patterns in movement has great potential to help &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;treat Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. One example of that is a new software called &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/ai-video-analysis-tool-helps-clinicians-assess-parkinsons-symptoms/"&gt;VisionMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This software, which is open-source and available for free, uses AI to analyze video taken right from the built-in camera on a computer or a phone to detect changes in &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. That’s important because assessing progression in Parkinson’s disease can be inconsistent. Many neurologists use the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale to compare different stages of the disease. This scale can be subjective based on who’s doing the exam, and humans can miss subtle changes that AI can detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the software is still new, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00876-6"&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt; found that the software’s ratings were even more consistent than those from experienced neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/ai-technology-parkinsons-trial-help-monitor-gait-freezing/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; being conducted at Emory University’s Movement Disorders Center in Georgia is using AI’s data-processing capabilities to understand what causes &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/columns/mind-vs-brain-gait-freezing-perplexing-parkinsons-symptom/"&gt;gait freezing&lt;/a&gt; and to test treatments and ways of managing this common &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology is being used in a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of gamma sensory flicker, a noninvasive therapy originally developed to treat &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;. It’s based on the theory that flickering sound and light can potentially disrupt brain signals and ease symptoms. The study leads touted the “precision and consistency” of AI-powered symptom tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another application is one I’ve personally experienced. I went to see one of my doctors the other day, and they had new AI transcription software. The program recorded the appointment, developed an accurate transcription, summarized the discussion, and suggested links to preapproved content on our treatment plan, which my provider texted me before I could get to my car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study found that doctors spend as much as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7661623/#:~:text=Using%20EHR%20access%20logs%20from,telephone%20encounters%20and%20other%20activities."&gt;one-third of their time&lt;/a&gt; writing notes. By using AI, doctors can reduce time on paperwork and make visits more productive. If you’re anything like me, remembering everything you talk about in an appointment is difficult. After this visit, I had an instant summary and follow-up materials to help me remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the idea of using AI to monitor symptoms like gait issues. That’s long been a challenge for me, and it’s hard for me to see gait changes in myself. Having a consistent and objective “eye” could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI cannot be used alone in diagnosing or treating a disease like Parkinson’s. But if it can help extend the reach and consistency of evaluations and give patients more accurate assessments of their disease, I welcome it. We’ll always need doctors to oversee these tools, just like my column will always need a human editor, but it’s another way to potentially improve care for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tnk001b3b76b5ihju9o@published"&gt;One of my best friends is going through a difficult patch in her marriage. They have two young kids, both work full-time, and she definitely carries the mental load. She has said they don’t communicate well, and that she is open to marriage counseling. However, she said it’s one thing too many for her to take on, so for them to go, he has to make the effort to do it. Apparently, he has suggested counseling in the past but never followed through. I think if they don’t, they are headed toward divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tpk001c3b76z6mngq1s@published"&gt;Should I tell my friend’s husband he needs to do this, or stay out of it and watch them struggle? I’m not really friends with him, but we are cordial when we see each other. I don’t really want to get in the middle of it, but I also know she will lean heavily on me if they ever did get divorced, so part of me feels like I should tell him for my own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="8" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tuh001f3b76d6c8v541@published"&gt;Nope. Don’t say anything. For a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;ol data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmal98ysa001j3b76ci2ii4zk@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While counseling can be great, it isn’t a magic fix for a marriage, and it doesn’t guarantee that a couple will stay together. If it’s going to help, both people have to be invested in the process. Your friend and her husband lack the collective energy or willingness to make an appointment, which suggests they’re at least a bit checked out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is sort of like how a high school student who needs major hand-holding to schedule their SATs, write essays, and apply may not actually be ready to succeed in college, where they’ll have to manage all their work independently. This couple’s failure to book an appointment without outside encouragement makes me think neither of them is currently in the right frame of mind to work hard to repair their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He probably wouldn’t take your suggestion anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a secret you then have to keep from your good friend is asking for trouble. Especially a secret that involves private conversations with her husband. Even if your intentions are pure, there’s a lot of potential for it to become messy and hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if he opens up and tells you that for him to want to stay married, she’d need to get rid of two-thirds of the throw pillows in the house, or stop leaving so much hair in the bathtub? Are you going to keep passing messages back and forth indefinitely? You could get in over your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9a3zd001o3b76qihfdgdc@published"&gt;What you should do instead is develop a plan for how you want to be there for your friend during this time, whether it turns out to be a long rough patch in her marriage or a divorce. I can tell you’re worried she’ll demand too much of you, or will expect you to help her figure out how to set up her new life if they split up. So think about what kind of support you’d like to provide—meaning, what will make you feel good and not resentful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9a9th001t3b763pin6ukb@published"&gt;Get ahead of the situation and do that now, before you’re exhausted from your 12th session with her as an unpaid therapist or before she’s asked to come sleep on your couch while she looks for a new place, needs money for a lawyer, or is newly single and wants you to be her wing woman when she goes out looking for dates. Do it instead of just bracing for her overwhelming need.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxs00233b76r7bgigkl@published"&gt;I’m a 24-year-old woman and was born as the product of my dad’s affair with my mom. His wife, “Ava,” took him back after finding out because she said they had to stay together for their children. I lived with Mom most of the time and spent occasional weekends and holidays at Dad’s with Ava and my half-sisters. Ava hated me. She fed me food I was allergic to multiple times or fed me nothing if I wouldn’t eat the allergens, screamed at me for every little thing, and would give my half-sisters extra love, attention, and random gifts while smirking at me. She told me regularly I was going to be a failure like my mother (and this is how I learned of my mom’s drug problems!). Dad was useless and only spoke nicely to me when the others were out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxt00243b76qc5jpcxg@published"&gt;The only person who was kind to me was “Katherine,” my half-sister, who is near my age. She shared her presents and food, and we saw each other independently as teens. She’s a wonderful person, and we’re close as adults. We’re true sisters. Her older sister never acknowledges me. My mom died last year of an overdose and has left me a surprisingly large sum of money along with her house. It seems she won a lot gambling after I moved out at 18, because we were poor growing up. It’s been a lot to take in, honestly—my grief is complicated after years of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxu00253b767qucnyqq@published"&gt;So far, I’ve used the money to pay off debts, and I mean to buy a house. Katherine has been really struggling since the unplanned birth of her child, and I wanted to help her, so I’ve given her $10,000 along with letting her stay in my mom’s old house while she finds her feet. It feels great to pay back her kindness! The problem is that Dad and Ava have found out. They want “their share” of the money and feel my mom owed them for years of free child care. Ava called me first, pretending to be friendly, then threatening legal action against me! Dad has called me crying, wanting to know why I don’t care about my family anymore. He keeps bringing up that he gave me his old car in my teens as proof that he’s done a lot for me, and talking about all the child support he paid “despite how it hurt Ava.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmala9bua00563b760ydbksno@published"&gt;Prudie, I don’t owe them anything, right? Should I give a one-off gift to stop them from harassing me? Ava has sobbed to me that I don’t understand how hard it was for her, and that she’s sorry for taking things out on me. She says I can’t hold on to long-ago grievances forever. Is there any merit to this point, and can you advise on how I move forward?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxx00283b76anr9mqi3@published"&gt;You can hold on to long-ago grievances for a lifetime, if you choose. Especially if they’re about the way you were mistreated as a child. Even if you didn’t have this grievance, your dad and Ava wouldn’t be entitled to your money. You don’t owe people for raising you, and especially not for raising you on occasional weekends and holidays during which they intentionally fed you food that would trigger your allergies. The fact that they call what they did “free child care” when you were just a kid spending time with her father says a lot about how they see you: not as their child or a real member of their family. It’s also worth noting that your dad and Ava didn’t show any interest in repairing their relationship with you until they thought it might lead to a windfall for them. Their gold-digging couldn’t be more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxz00293b76lqa4akwn@published"&gt;Absolutely do not give them a cent. And block their numbers. I don’t say that lightly, but the absence of any real relationship combined with their threats of legal action makes this a pretty easy call. Enjoy your new house, your relationship with Katherine, and your savings account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Imagine an AI model that can use a heart scan to guess what racial category you’re likely to be put in – even when it hasn’t been told what race is, or what to look for. It sounds like science fiction, but it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ehjdh/ztaf008/8038011?login=true"&gt;My recent study&lt;/a&gt;, which I conducted with colleagues, found that an AI model could guess whether a patient identified as Black or white from heart images with up to 96% accuracy – despite no explicit information about racial categories being given. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a striking finding that challenges assumptions about the objectivity of AI and highlights a deeper issue: AI systems don’t just reflect the world – they &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/dec/bias-ai-amplifies-our-own-biases"&gt;absorb and reproduce the biases&lt;/a&gt; built into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it’s important to be clear: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7682789/"&gt;race is not a biological category&lt;/a&gt;. Modern genetics &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/9/1/232/6299389"&gt;shows there is more variation&lt;/a&gt; within supposed racial groups than between them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Race"&gt;Race is a social construct&lt;/a&gt;, a set of categories invented by societies to classify people based on perceived physical traits and ancestry. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250417-biological-reality-what-genetics-has-taught-us-about-race"&gt;These classifications don’t map&lt;/a&gt; cleanly onto biology, but they shape everything from lived experience to access to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, many AI systems are now learning to detect, and potentially act on, these social labels, because they are built using data shaped by a &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2024/07/racism-and-ai-bias-past-leads-bias-future"&gt;world that treats race as if it were biological fact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems are already transforming healthcare. They can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckdpg5p820xo"&gt;analyse chest X-rays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/is-artificial-intelligence-better-at-assessing-heart-health/"&gt;read heart scans&lt;/a&gt; and flag potential issues faster than human doctors – &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.119.009214"&gt;in some cases&lt;/a&gt;, in seconds rather than minutes. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/"&gt;Hospitals are adopting these tools&lt;/a&gt; to improve efficiency, reduce costs and standardise care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bias isn’t a bug – it’s built in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how sophisticated, &lt;a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics/cases"&gt;AI systems are not neutral&lt;/a&gt;. They are trained on real-world data – and that data &lt;a href="https://unu.edu/article/never-assume-accuracy-artificial-intelligence-information-equals-truth"&gt;reflects real-world inequalities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights"&gt;including those based on&lt;/a&gt; race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status. These systems can learn &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-66259618"&gt;to treat patients differently&lt;/a&gt; based on these characteristics, even when no one explicitly programs them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11542778/"&gt;One major source of bias&lt;/a&gt; is imbalanced training data. If a model learns primarily from lighter skinned patients, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260724000403?via%3Dihub"&gt;it may struggle&lt;/a&gt; to detect conditions in people with darker skin. 
&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq6147"&gt;Studies in dermatology&lt;/a&gt; have already shown this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even language models like ChatGPT aren’t immune: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-023-00939-z"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; evidence that some models still reproduce outdated and false medical beliefs, such as the myth that Black patients have thicker skin than white patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes AI models appear accurate, but for the wrong reasons – a phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00338-7"&gt;shortcut learning&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of learning the complex features of a disease, a model might rely on irrelevant but easier to spot clues in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine two hospital wards: one uses scanner A to treat severe COVID-19 patients, another uses scanner B for milder cases. The AI might learn to associate scanner A with severe illness – not because it understands the disease better, but because it’s picking up on image artefacts specific to scanner A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a seriously ill patient is scanned using scanner B. The model might mistakenly classify them as less sick – not due to a medical error, but because it learned the wrong shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same kind of flawed reasoning could apply to race. If there are differences in disease prevalence between racial groups, the AI could end up learning to identify race instead of the disease – with dangerous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the heart scan study, researchers found that the AI model wasn’t actually focusing on the heart itself, where there were few visible differences linked to racial categories. Instead, it drew information from areas outside the heart, such as subcutaneous fat as well as image artefacts – unwanted distortions like motion blur, noise, or compression that can degrade image quality. These artefacts often come from the scanner and can influence how the AI interprets the scan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, Black participants had a higher-than-average BMI, which could mean they had more subcutaneous fat, though this wasn’t directly investigated. Some research has shown that Black individuals tend to have less visceral fat and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2010.248"&gt;smaller waist circumference&lt;/a&gt; at a given BMI, but more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12601630/"&gt;subcutaneous fat&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests the AI may have been picking up on these indirect racial signals, rather than anything relevant to the heart itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because when AI models learn race – or rather, social patterns that reflect racial inequality – without understanding context, the risk is that they may reinforce or worsen existing disparities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about fairness – it’s about safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify training data&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23443-9_22"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that making &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8515002/"&gt;datasets more representative&lt;/a&gt; improves AI performance across groups – without harming accuracy for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: many AI systems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0933365721001512?via%3Dihub"&gt;are considered “black boxes”&lt;/a&gt; because we don’t understand how they reach their conclusions. The heart scan study used heat maps to show which parts of an image influenced the AI’s decision, creating a form of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11391805/"&gt;explainable AI&lt;/a&gt; that helps doctors and patients trust (or question) results – so we can catch when it’s using inappropriate shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat race carefully&lt;/strong&gt;: researchers and developers must recognise that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11626588/"&gt;race in data is a social signal&lt;/a&gt;, not a biological truth. It requires thoughtful handling to avoid perpetuating harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI models are capable of spotting patterns that even the most trained human eyes might miss. That’s what makes them so powerful – and potentially so dangerous. It learns from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/"&gt;the same flawed world we do&lt;/a&gt;. That includes how we treat race: not as a scientific reality, but as a social lens through which health, opportunity and risk are unequally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If AI systems learn our shortcuts, they may repeat our mistakes – faster, at scale and with less accountability. And when lives are on the line, that’s a risk we cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The 10th- and 12th-graders’ use of pouches in the 12 months and 30 days before the surveys also increased year to year. Males were also more likely to use pouches than females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S27BR6ZJ3RAUHNC4O3QANRTLVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Looking at race and ethnicity data, use was highest among White, non-Hispanic 10th- and 12th-grade teens — 9 percent had used a nicotine pouch at some point.

"The gut-brain axis is being expanded to become the gut-brain-microbiome axis," he says. Dr. Farhadi points out that the majority of serotonin, which is the main neurotransmitter that influences mood and happiness, is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6469458/#:~:text=Neurologic%20Pathway,the%20lumen%20of%20the%20gut.&amp;amp;text=The%20autonomic%20nervous%20system%20also,intrinsic%20primary%20afferent%20neuron%20excitability." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6469458/#:~:text=Neurologic%20Pathway,the%20lumen%20of%20the%20gut.&amp;amp;text=The%20autonomic%20nervous%20system%20also,intrinsic%20primary%20afferent%20neuron%20excitability." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="produced in the gut" data-node-id="19.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;produced in the gut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"Bacteria are in the vicinity and they are modulating the function of the gut," he says.

The museum sparked some outcry about public funding, but the community has warmed to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYOLF6FRLZDQDF44WZI67P5OJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Despite its ponderous official name, the museum is a colorful, trippy delight: Outside is a mosquito-themed playground, complete with a sliding board designed to look like oversize versions of common mosquito hiding spots — a barrel of water on a stack of old tires. There’s a climbing block made from a concrete culvert (prime mosquito breeding grounds), and a dragonfly-shaped riding toy with a sign that reads, “Dragonflies are good to have around because baby dragonflies eat baby mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KEL3KAJ6CJGJ3BYVHGGWHNM4IQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The education center is ostensibly aimed at children but also geared toward teaching adults a little more about the No. 1 insect killer of humankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5EI6RW5XYVEUJDPWNMRBAETASE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Florida has the distinction of being one of the most pestiferous places on the planet,” said Gordon M.

A lifelike&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;model&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of a yellow Labrador retriever named Albo — short for the type of mosquito that transmits heartworm &lt;b&gt;— &lt;/b&gt;sits in the front yard, near his water bowl. That’s another example of a mosquito attractant. So is a small but realistic pile of Albo’s droppings: a part of the exhibit that makes schoolkids squeal with delight, museum guides say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BS4VCWCW5F2DN3P7HKOQ3N7HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Across from that is a realistic slice of swampland: dark green, shadowy and damp, representing&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ideal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mosquito habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TJ3FG5NKJNH3LFWGD44H36CXKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both large displays have touch-screen computers set up that encourage visitors to try to spy mosquito hideouts. Push the right button, and a spotlight shines down on the water bowl, or the flower pot, or the birdbath and a half-dozen other common yard items. It makes the point that mosquitoes can lay eggs in even a teaspoon of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JPZPEGMIGRAJTPMU6CERDP5LXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A helicopter takes up a big space indoors.

Most of the state’s 67 counties and many cities across the state have districts that work full time to contain the insects, some of them with elected officials who oversee multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hQpAdy-isCenteredLayoutFullBleedImg-true article-body type-image subtype-StaffPhoto grid-full-bleed" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T3OBHLO2QBEA3HYM2IAG635UAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mosquitoes are disease vectors, which means they can transmit diseases between species. Among them: malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, yellow fever, and Zika virus. More than 700,000 people die each year from vector-borne diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJHRTU6YEJAQPGAFILDBHJP7EY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Controlling them is key to keeping Florida survivable for 23 million residents and 143 million annual visitors. The Anastasia Mosquito Control District of St. Johns County, founded in 1948, is one of the best-known agencies dedicated to mosquito control. Researchers there work with universities and governments around the world, along with groups such as the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZJZF4OJTLNC23BAMEGXZQUT56A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Executive Director Rui-De Xue had the idea of a building a mosquito education center after visiting one in China several years ago. Supporters envisioned it as another tool in “understanding the tiny yet formidable mosquito,” as the center’s visitor guide puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E652RKEIFVA3FJI6EW5COZKS2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There was pushback from some residents and county commissioners about using tax dollars, but the mosquito district — which has an annual budget of about $9 million — forged onward. The district’s board said it makes sense to educate the public about things people can do to control mosquitoes: clean birdbaths every few days, empty the dog’s outdoor water bowl daily, dump out anything that holds standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDIGQDK7G5E33JLRCVACA6KOOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To get past the consternation over what critics called a bug museum, the name became the Disease Vector Education Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5YH2R4KIJ5A57DRBIWAE3ILPVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Monzon said more than 11,000 people visited in the first year, many of them part of school groups. The museum closes Mondays and Tuesdays to host school field trips. The rest of the week, it’s open to the public with free admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HUVFQZCFFRCQZBK6ASS57W42CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sandra Gewehr visited when she was in town for the annual Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Control Workshop last year. She recommends it, calling it a “smart and unusual choice” for tourists, especially families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IVPXLC3GYRC43LCUAIWOJENI6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While the subject matter is serious, the center does an admirable job of making it approachable and fun for children,” said Gewehr, who is director of research and development at the European Mosquito Control Association and based in Greece. “There are elements designed specifically to engage younger audiences — things they can touch, see up close, and interact with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="633AL5UNFJENTGBI27ZQBSAT7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Patterson, a history professor at the Florida Institute of Technology as well as a mosquito book author, gave the museum designers some tips and mosquito information.

			&lt;p&gt;A migraine drug called ubrogepant doesn't just reduce the severity of a migraine attack – it also dials down the non-headache symptoms in the prodrome: the hours leading up to the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the conclusion reached after a large  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="161019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; tested hundreds of migraine patients taking the medication at the onset of prodrome symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ubrogepant-oral-route/description/drg-20481621"&gt;ubrogepant&lt;/a&gt; might be effective for treating the entire migraine as it evolves, rather than just the head pain – and narrows down the mechanisms behind the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a neurological affliction that affects an estimated &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00763-1"&gt;14 to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the global population, yet it remains poorly understood, and difficult to treat effectively. It's known for its searing, debilitating head pain, but the anatomy of a migraine is much more &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201"&gt;complex and longer-lasting&lt;/a&gt; than just the head pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, a migraine consists of three to four stages: the prodrome, during which the patient experiences symptoms such as light sensitivity, nausea, neck pain, and brain fog; aura, characterized by vision disturbances, including blind spots and flashing lights; the headache attack itself; and the postdrome, characterized by brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBvGbn1MuPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, this sequence of events can last up to &lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/how-long-does-a-migraine-attack-last/"&gt;more than a week&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most treatments focus on the headache portion, since it's the most debilitating. Even studies on treatments designed to be taken during the prodrome phase have concentrated on blocking the headache, rather than treating the prodrome itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by neurologist Peter Goadsby of Kings College London, a team of researchers has now conducted a trial on whether or not ubrogepant, a migtainte treatment available in the US under the brand name Ubrelvy, also works on the prodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists want to know not just how to treat the entirety of a migraine – although that's a desired goal – but to help determine what drives a migraine attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has long been argued whether migraine is primarily a disease of the brain or of peripheral, specifically vascular, origin," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;. "The new data firmly support a brain origin for migraine attacks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubrogepant is a drug that does not prevent migraine attacks, but reduces the severity of the pain associated with an attack. It belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide_receptor_antagonist"&gt;calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists.&lt;/a&gt; Ubrogepant, and other drugs belonging to the same class, block the action of CGRP, a peptide associated with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goadsby and his colleagues recruited hundreds of migraine patients for a double-blind study. The 438 study participants, aged between 18 and 75, and all with at least a one-year history of migraine, were put in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was given ubrogepant at the onset of prodrome symptoms; the other was given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="161019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. Then, during a second event at least seven days later, the groups switched. The patients initially given the drug were given the placebo, and vice versa. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew which group was receiving which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug or the placebo, the participants were tasked with reporting changes in their symptoms, which included photo- and phonophobia, dizziness, fatigue, neck pain or stiffness, and brain fog. The patients taking the drug experienced a significantly higher reduction in their symptoms than the patients taking the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_nA-IfOyp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hour after taking ubrogepant, patients reported brain fog easing. After two hours, photophobia, or sensitivity to light, decreased. After three hours, neck problems eased. Between four and 24 hours after taking the drug, phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) and dizziness lessened, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that CGRP receptor antagonists might be effective at treating prodromal migraine symptoms, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As premonitory symptoms can be disabling, their treatment alone is clinically relevant, beyond the consideration that treatment during the prodrome prevents headache onset and improves function over 24 to 48 hours, as demonstrated in the primary analysis of the study," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition: "Broadly, the findings of the clinical trial support imaging studies that have identified central nervous system sites as the locus of initiation of a migraine attack."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several routes forward from here. The study didn't look at the effects of ubrogepant on the aura and postdrome phases of migraine, which could warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work could also probe further to try and narrow down the cause of migraine, and determine whether CGRP receptor antagonists might offer relief for the entire course of a migraine event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ancient tomb in Greece does not hold the remains of Philip II, the father of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/39997-alexander-the-great.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/39997-alexander-the-great.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as some scholars think it does, a new study suggests. Instead, it contains the remains of a younger man who died before Philip II did, archaeologists propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the July 2025 issue of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106234" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106234" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also revealed that the tomb is the burial place of a young woman and six infants. Prior to this study researchers knew of the existence of the man, woman and at least one infant in the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have long scrutinized the tomb, which was discovered in 1977 at the site of Vergina (also called Aigai), in northern Greece. Known as "Tomb I," it is located beneath a large tumulus (burial mound) that has a shrine on top. It's near several other tombs, which are thought to hold other members of Alexander the Great's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scholars have suggested that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510906112" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510906112" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tomb I held the burial of Philip II&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although many other scholars believe that he was most likely &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.2307/630280" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.2307/630280" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buried in Tomb II&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was not studied in the newly published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that Tomb I has no doorway and was sealed off in ancient times, it's likely that the man and woman were buried together, at the same time, the researchers noted. Radiocarbon dating of their remains indicates that the man and woman lived sometime between 388 and 356 B.C., the researchers wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of their bones and teeth suggested that the man in the tomb was between 25 and 35 years old at the time of his death. Philip II, in comparison, was assassinated in 336 B.C., at about age 46. This suggests that the man buried in Tomb I is not Philip II, the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The bones from Tomb I that remain for the adult male (at left) and adult female (at right).

The dates mean that the infants are likely not related to the man or woman, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Tcv4whCFUgD5bj6LPb4SAE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Tcv4whCFUgD5bj6LPb4SAE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is evidence that disposing dead infants in old tombs, wells or underground voids is not an uncommon practice in the Roman period," study lead researcher &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://demokritos.academia.edu/YannisManiatis" target="_blank" data-url="https://demokritos.academia.edu/YannisManiatis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yannis Maniatis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the laboratory of archaeometry, of the National Center of Scientific Research Demokritos in Greece, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tomb was robbed in ancient times, and the people who lived in the area would have seen the openings left by robbers and decided to use them for the burial of infants, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-were-the-man-and-woman-buried-in-the-tomb-3"&gt;Who were the man and woman buried in the tomb?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's finds leave a number of questions unanswered. Namely, the researchers wondered, who are the man and woman buried in the tomb? To investigate, the team did a strontium and stable carbon analysis of the skeletal and tooth remains, which can provide information on a person's diet and where they lived as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man likely spent his childhood away from the Macedonian capital of Pella, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Vergina, the isotopic tests revealed. The woman — who died between the ages of 18 and 25, according to an anatomical analysis — likely spent her childhood living in or near Pella. Although their identities remain unknown, the tomb's opulence indicates that they were elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We assume that he must be a Macedon King who ruled and died decades before Philip II's assassination," Maniatis said. It's unclear which king that was, but candidates include Alexander II (reigned circa 370 to 368 B.C.) and Perdiccas III (reigned from 365 to 359 B.C.), the team wrote in the study. Both rulers had tumultuous reigns that dealt with war and infighting within the ancient kingdom of Macedon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-is-philip-ii-buried-3"&gt;Where is Philip II buried?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maniatis said the team is not certain where Philip II is buried. Many scholars have suggested that Tomb II at Vergina holds his cremated remains. Previous research done by other scholars has shown that Tomb II is a "two-chamber vaulted tomb found unlooted, with all the grave goods intact, containing the cremated remains of a male" who was around 44 years old when he died, Maniatis noted. However, he emphasized that Tomb II was not studied as part of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://duth.academia.edu/AntonisBartsiokas" target="_blank" data-url="https://duth.academia.edu/AntonisBartsiokas" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Antonis Bartsiokas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus of physical anthropology and paleoanthropology at the Democritus University of Thrace and one of the researchers who has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-tomb-really-does-hold-alexander-the-greats-father-controversial-study-claims" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-tomb-really-does-hold-alexander-the-greats-father-controversial-study-claims"&gt;&lt;u&gt;suggested Philip II is buried in Tomb I&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told Live Science that he and other supporters of this theory will reply in a journal article of their own and don't want to comment further at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to answer first to the journal," Bartsiokas told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world"&gt;Alexander the Great quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How well do you know the famous king and conqueror from the ancient world?&lt;/h2&gt;

patterns were recorded via wrist actigraphy, according to &lt;em&gt;Medical Xpress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the volunteer reported three hours of daily bedtime, the actigraph device signalled an average of 6.3 hours of sleep each night. The researchers collected her DNA samples and carried out whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants that could be making her a super sleeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mid-taboola"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a mutation – N783Y – in the salt-induced kinase 3 (SIK3) protein kinase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-the-study-found"&gt;What the study found&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified five mutations in four genes that are linked with short sleep in humans, as per a &lt;em&gt;Medical Xpress&lt;/em&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers say that one of these mutations alters the protein structure of SIK3. The mutation – N783Y – that changes the structure of this gene plays a key role in determining sleep and wakefulness, as per an &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists studied this mutation – SIK3-N783Y – in genetically modified mice, which were found to sleep an average of 30 minutes less each night, compared to other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After further analysis, they discovered that the mutation led to structural changes, impairing the protein’s ability to transfer key phosphate molecules to other proteins. This results in reduced duration of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newadd newtopadd newcontainer clearfix ad-background"&gt;&lt;span&gt;STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="lazyloadads" id="bodyad-13887827-4" data-desktop-adslot="/1039154/FSTPST_ENG/FSTPST_ENG_ROS/FSTPST_ENG_ROS_AS/FSTPST_ENG_ROS_AS_ROS_PG_1x1_4" data-desktop-adsizes="[[300, 250],[1, 1]]" data-mobile-adslot="/1039154/FSTPST_ENG_PWA/FSTPST_ENG_ROS_PWA/FSTPST_ENG_ROS_PWA_AS/FSTPST_ENG_AS_PWA_ROS_PG_1x1_4" data-mobile-adsizes="[[300, 250],[1, 1]]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img nw18-data-src="https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-12T182620.695-2025-05-505636e61df51173ff823e1c0d090c30.jpg" alt="sleep "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some people can thrive on just four hours of sleep.

but may also feel “worse” if they sleep more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed,” detoxifying themselves and repairing damage, study co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. “These people [natural short sleepers], all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists hope the latest study will help them improve sleep quality and design better treatments for sleep disorders. “These findings advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of sleep,” scientists wrote, adding that it gives “further support for potential therapeutic strategies to enhance sleep efficiency”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you are a short sleeper, now you know why you have that superpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newadd newtopadd newcontainer clearfix ad-background"&gt;&lt;span&gt;STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="lazyloadads" id="bodyad-13887827-5" data-desktop-adslot="/1039154/FSTPST_ENG/FSTPST_ENG_HEALTH/FSTPST_ENG_HEALTH_AS/FSTPST_ENG_HLTH_AS_ROS_MTF_300" data-desktop-adsizes="[[300, 250],[336, 280]]" data-mobile-adslot="/1039154/FSTPST_ENG_PWA/FSTPST_ENG_HEALTH_PWA/FSTPST_ENG_HEALTH_PWA_AS/FSTPST_ENG_HLTH_AS_PWA_ROS_MTF_300" data-mobile-adsizes="[[300, 250],[336, 280]]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With inputs from agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="livtv_and_video_widgt_wrap" data-livetv-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=FP2.0_fact_live" data-featured-video-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-videos-list?fields=title,pg_id,id,mongo_id,sources,duration,created_at,shows.slug,shows.title,author_byline.name,images,weburl&amp;amp;sortBy=created_at&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;count=10&amp;amp;filter=%7b%22shows.slug%22:%22vantage%22,%22video_type%22:%22vod%22%7d" data-category="health" data-env="PROD" data-page-url="www.firstpost.com/health/people-four-hours-of-sleep-mutation-natural-short-sleep-science-ws-e-13887827.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Firstpost</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 14:41:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
