The results did not paint a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The mice, especially the older ones, started to show behavioral changes eerily similar to dementia. The plastic particles crossed the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation in the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jaime Ross, the study's lead author, told the Post she was alarmed by how quickly the changes took place, saying: "I'm still really surprised by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This isn't just an isolated finding. The concern is that these plastic particles could be an environmental trigger for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Research Communications found that when mice with a high-risk gene for Alzheimer's, APOE4, were exposed to microplastics, they showed significant cognitive and behavioral changes that weren't seen in mice without the gene. This suggests that microplastics could interact with genetic predispositions to accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is made worse by daily exposure. We're constantly in contact with plastics, and another study has raised concerns about cytotoxicity from microplastics, especially from food containers that are heated or cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the science is alarming, the good news is that people are tackling this problem from every angle. It starts with simple choices, and there's a lot of &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helpful information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;helpful information&lt;/a&gt; available on how to use less plastic in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Innovation is also providing hope. To get these particles out of our environment, researchers have developed a new kind of filter designed to catch even the smallest bits of plastic that usually slip through water treatment systems. For plastics already in our bodies, scientists have discovered a promising new way to filter microplastics out of human blood using a method similar to dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the fight to protect our health, another study found that powerful antioxidants found in many fruits and flowers can counteract some of the dangerous effects that microplastic exposure can have on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the link between microplastics and cognitive decline is deeply concerning, emerging scientific breakthroughs in filtering our water, cleansing our bodies, and using natural compounds to protect our health offer a hopeful path forward in tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec7QW0GpshZ5tm1o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNUGZDTHp6YW1rNHBPSmU5cllIMkJkOWhqWUpCbzRnUzNWXzJBQ01iR3VWTkRHMGgweU41cnFiWEdkVVEydG9JOGlDQmJqc2J0cEVnOTNuNmwzMFo5eGt1MTRBczk5VDAzTldPNldkOTdWM1JnenFCYkNZQzRVR0R3aFJiS2c3Z3U5MWdDR0s5MWUxWlpjSzYtWTY1TXNqQQ</guid></item><item><title>受影响的寡妇在他们最喜欢的海滩的小牛水中划桨后，因食肉细菌而失去了丈夫-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15127087/Virginia-Beach-vibrio-bacteria-infection-dead-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A devastated widow has shared how she lost her husband to flesh-eating bacteria after he paddled in calf-deep water at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-a2274230-98c0-11f0-824e-2fed9f798c67"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; beach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a trip to the classic vacation spot in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They waded in the water and did not even go up to their knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that was all it took for a bacteria called vibrio vulnificus to make it into a small, open cut on Derek's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Virginia Beach was our absolute favorite place to go,' D'Arcy told &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/teachers-lesson-deadly-bacteria-vibrio/507-bc3404bf-30d6-45d1-aac7-284be29cd62e"&gt;WTSP&lt;/a&gt;. 'So its just so sad that the best place that we had is where he got sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days after the couple's trip to the beach, D'Arcy noticed a purple stripe on her husband's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The husband and wife sent his blood for testing, but by the time the test came back positive for vibrio another three days later, the infection had already spread across both his legs, causing severe damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which D'Arcy believes contributed to the rapid spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors determined that the only way to save Derek was by amputating his legs to stop the infection from spreading. Sadly, they didn't act quickly enough and just 12 hours after the surgery, the vibrio bacteria had spread Derek's chest, hands and head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that point, 'we knew we lost the fight,' D'Arcy said. Her husband would die around a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach where the husband was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria that would take his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Virginia Beach (pictured) was the couple's 'absolute favorite place to go'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vibrio infections are surprisingly common, and experts say one in five people who are infected will die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The widow hopes her story can serve as a warning to others about how quickly a person can die to the aggressive, flesh-eating bacteria and that awareness can save another family from experiencing a similar tragic and unexpected loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic doctors say vibrio is more common than people think, especially in the warmer months of May through October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections happen fairly often.  Most people survive but symptoms are very painful and many sufferers must face having limbs amputated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14983485/Deadly-flesh-eating-bacteria-spread-beaches-cases-surge-terrifying-rise.html"&gt;cases of vibrio infection rose into the double digits&lt;/a&gt; along the Gulf Coast and further up Atlantic Coast.  Experts believe the rising infections are caused by warming waters as the bacteria thrives in waters between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15065795/florida-mom-death-flesh-eating-bacteria-beach.html"&gt;a mother was left fighting for her life and almost lost her leg&lt;/a&gt; after contracting vibrio when she swam at Quietwater Beach in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also earlier this month,&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15056609/Vibrio-vulnificus-flesh-eating-bacteria-florida.html"&gt; a father contracted a vibrio infection after a fishing trip&lt;/a&gt;, which caused serious swelling and a burning sensation in his foot and ankle. It took three surgeries for doctors to stop the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in five people who are infected with vibrio will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="333" data-end="597"&gt;We live in a world where women are praised for being “strong” and “resilient.” On the outside, it looks like they’ve got it together—juggling careers, families, friendships, and everything in between. But here’s the truth: strength can sometimes mask exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="599" data-end="822"&gt;I’ve seen it in my own circles—women smiling through clenched teeth, showing up for everyone else while quietly running on empty. And maybe you’ve felt it yourself: that tug between appearing fine and actually being okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="824" data-end="1009"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always announce itself with a dramatic breakdown. More often, it slips in quietly, disguised as everyday habits and coping strategies. That’s why it’s so easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;If you’ve been wondering whether you—or someone you love—might be silently struggling, here are nine subtle signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1150" data-end="1181"&gt;1. She laughs everything off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1183" data-end="1415"&gt;Humor can be a brilliant coping tool. It allows us to soften the heaviness of life and connect with others. But when every struggle is brushed aside with a joke or a quick laugh, it may be less about joy and more about deflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1417" data-end="1625"&gt;I once caught myself laughing while telling a friend, “Oh, I barely slept all week, but who needs rest, right?” The truth was, I was completely depleted. That kind of humor isn’t lighthearted—it’s a shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1627" data-end="1964"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.peacheycounselling.ca/blog/the-mental-health-effects-of-masking-how-you-feel?.com"&gt;“masking,”&lt;/a&gt; and it often prevents deeper conversations. Friends and coworkers hear the joke and move on, never realizing there’s pain beneath the surface. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice the humor doesn’t quite land as joy—it lands as avoidance. And avoidance is one of burnout’s favorite hiding spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1971" data-end="2000"&gt;2. She’s always “too busy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2002" data-end="2157"&gt;Ever notice how some women keep their calendars packed to the brim? Work meetings, social gatherings, errands, volunteer work—anything to stay in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2159" data-end="2412"&gt;On the surface, it looks like ambition. But sometimes busyness is just burnout in disguise. When you’re constantly running from one task to another, there’s no space left to sit with uncomfortable feelings. Busyness becomes a distraction from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2414" data-end="2759"&gt;As Rudá Iandê notes in &lt;em data-start="2437" data-end="2500"&gt;&lt;a class="decorated-link" href="https://thevessel.io/laughing-in-the-face-of-chaos-book/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="2438" data-end="2499"&gt;Laughing in the Face of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “the more we try to escape or numb the chaos within, the more powerful the currents become.” His words hit me hard because I used to fill every spare hour just to avoid slowing down. Stillness can feel scary when your emotions are screaming for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2761" data-end="2931"&gt;Here’s the paradox: the very thing that looks like high functioning is often a sign that someone is hanging on by a thread. She’s not thriving—she’s outrunning herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2938" data-end="2985"&gt;3. Her sleep patterns are all over the place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3165"&gt;Sleep is often the first casualty of burnout. She may collapse into bed early but wake at 3 a.m. with racing thoughts. Or she may stay up late scrolling, dreading the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3349"&gt;Sleep disruption doesn’t just mean feeling groggy in the morning. It means her nervous system is stuck in overdrive. Even when her body begs for rest, her mind refuses to shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3351" data-end="3545"&gt;I’ve been there—lying in bed, exhausted but wired, rehearsing tomorrow’s to-do list over and over. For women pretending to be fine, poor sleep becomes the quiet evidence that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3547" data-end="3778"&gt;Research consistently &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e012816?.com"&gt;links burnout to insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and left unchecked, it creates a vicious cycle. The less she sleeps, the more drained she becomes—and the harder it gets to admit she’s struggling. Burnout thrives in that silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3785" data-end="3823"&gt;4. She avoids talking about herself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3825" data-end="4004"&gt;Have you ever noticed how some women are brilliant at steering the spotlight away from themselves? Ask how they’re doing and suddenly you’re talking about your own life instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4006" data-end="4212"&gt;This isn’t just politeness. It’s self-protection. Talking about herself might open the door to emotions she’s not ready to face. So she avoids vulnerability and instead turns the conversation back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4214" data-end="4415"&gt;It’s easy to mistake this for being “selfless” or “a great listener.” But if you scratch beneath the surface, it’s often a way of hiding. Pretending to be “fine” feels safer than admitting she’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4417" data-end="4558"&gt;This is one of the trickiest signs because it often looks like strength. But avoidance, in this case, is exhaustion wearing a polite smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4565" data-end="4598"&gt;5. She downplays her struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4784"&gt;A woman might casually mention, “I’ve just been a little tired lately,” when in reality she’s hanging on by a thread. Or she might frame serious stress as “just one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="5048"&gt;This isn’t denial—it’s survival. Admitting the full weight of her exhaustion feels overwhelming, so she minimizes it. Unfortunately, the more she downplays, the more isolated she becomes. Others assume she doesn’t need help, and the cycle of silence continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5050" data-end="5363"&gt;This is where Rudá Iandê’s insight rings true: “When we let go of the need to be perfect, we free ourselves to live fully—embracing the mess, complexity, and richness of a life that's delightfully real.” I’ve noticed how often women feel pressure to be “low-maintenance,” as though asking for support is a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5365" data-end="5438"&gt;But constant minimization is not strength—it’s a quiet cry for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5445" data-end="5478"&gt;6. Her body carries the weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5480" data-end="5617"&gt;Burnout rarely stays in the mind. It makes its home in the body: tension headaches, tight shoulders, stomach issues, unexplained aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5619" data-end="5799"&gt;I once went through months of stress that showed up as constant migraines. It took me ages to realize my body was trying to tell me what my mouth wouldn’t say: “You’re not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;Experts in somatic psychology emphasize that our bodies speak for us when we won’t. A woman insisting she’s fine while constantly battling physical symptoms isn’t lying—she may genuinely not connect the dots yet. But the body rarely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;A recent Swedish study found that people with high burnout &lt;a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A1742868/FULLTEXT01.pdf?.com"&gt;report many somatic symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—headaches, back pain, stomach problems, trouble sleeping—far more often than people without burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6043" data-end="6195"&gt;When physical pain becomes routine and excuses like “just stress” or “nothing serious” get repeated, it’s worth asking whether burnout has taken root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6202" data-end="6230"&gt;7. She withdraws socially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6452"&gt;On paper, she’s still present—she shows up at gatherings, sends birthday texts, maybe even posts on social media. But her engagement is surface-level. Conversations feel flat. She’s there, but she’s not &lt;em data-start="6435" data-end="6443"&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6616"&gt;Emotional burnout can make even lighthearted interactions feel draining. So while she might maintain appearances, she may quietly dread every social obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6618" data-end="6759"&gt;The irony? Many women fear that pulling back entirely will “let people down.” So they perform presence while secretly longing for solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6761" data-end="6915"&gt;Withdrawal doesn’t always look like disappearing. Sometimes it looks like her being “fine” in public and collapsing in private the moment she gets home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6922" data-end="6955"&gt;8. She relies on small escapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6957" data-end="7140"&gt;Wine at night. Endless streaming binges. Scrolling until her eyes blur. None of these things are inherently bad. But when they become daily rituals, it often signals deeper fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7142" data-end="7291"&gt;As one therapist explained in a seminar I attended, avoidance often masquerades as relaxation. What looks like “self-care” may actually be numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7293" data-end="7461"&gt;When the coping strategies pile up—snacks, wine, social media, shopping—it’s not indulgence. It’s a quiet attempt to silence the exhaustion she doesn’t want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7463" data-end="7656"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always scream—it whispers through little habits that add up over time. Pay attention to what she reaches for at the end of the day. It’s often the clue to what she’s avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7663" data-end="7695"&gt;9. She’s overly accommodating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7850"&gt;Have you met women who always say yes, always bend, always prioritize others? From the outside, it looks generous. But inside, it can feel suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7852" data-end="8062"&gt;I’ve been there myself—saying yes to everyone else while my own needs went unmet. What I learned, painfully, is that people-pleasing often stems from emotional exhaustion. It’s easier to comply than to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8064" data-end="8317"&gt;As Iandê reminds us, “Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life’s challenges.” A woman constantly saying yes isn’t thriving—she’s running on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8319" data-end="8476"&gt;Over-accommodation may look like compassion, but in reality, it’s a signal she’s too tired to hold boundaries. And boundaries are what keep burnout at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8483" data-end="8500"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8502" data-end="8661"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always look like collapse. Sometimes it looks like a woman smiling, joking, and assuring everyone she’s fine—while quietly unraveling inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8663" data-end="8827"&gt;The danger in ignoring these signs is that burnout compounds. The longer it goes unacknowledged, the harder it is to recover. That’s why awareness is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8829" data-end="8978"&gt;If you see yourself in these patterns, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Burnout is not a personal failing—it’s a human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8980" data-end="9209"&gt;Start small. Rest without guilt. Speak honestly, even if your voice shakes. And most importantly, remember this: you don’t have to keep pretending you’re fine. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to admit that you’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

He can say for a fact that autism exists in the community, contrary to President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs statement Monday that the Amish have ‚Äúessentially no autism.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Trump‚Äôs remarks perpetuate a false belief that autism rates are lower among the Amish, a misconception that Mitchell says resurfaces periodically.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The reality, he says, is that there is no good data on rates of the neurological disorder in the Amish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;But he knows firsthand from working with Amish people in the Lancaster area that they, too, struggle with autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúThere have not been any good studies to ascertain what the frequency is, so we don‚Äôt really know, but anecdotally, yes, there is autism in the Amish,‚Äù said Mitchell, a genetic epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He did a literature search within the last six months, and found only one study that did a systematic assessment of autism in the Amish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The study screened 1,899 Amish children across two communities in Holmes County, Ohio, and Elkhart-Lagrange County, Indiana,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;according to preliminary data presented at the &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html"&gt;International Meeting for Autism Research in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;They found a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That was lower than the general population‚Äôs estimated prevalence of 1 in 91 at the time; however, the difference could have been due to caregivers answering screening questions differently due to ‚Äúcultural norms and customs,‚Äù the paper noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúIt certainly dispels the myth that there is no autism in the Amish, at the very least,‚Äù Mitchell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Autism may be underdiagnosed among the Amish because they tend to handle health issues internally, within their communities, and seek professional medical care only for pressing problems, Mitchell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Some may not consider behavioral health issues such as autism an emergency medical concern. Many also do not have health insurance, which means they pay out of pocket any time they go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He added that it‚Äôs hard to compare the study‚Äôs prevalence rate with the general population because the study only looked at Amish children and did not use the same autism screening tool to assess the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That would be like giving different tests to students in a class and then trying to rank them by their scores. The questions should be standardized to ensure an accurate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúWhat you would really need to do is administer that same questionnaire, maybe, to the general population, and see what you get,‚Äù Mitchell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Therefore, the data isn‚Äôt enough proof of there being lower rates of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;Administration zeros in on autism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At a White House news conference on Monday, the Trump administration announced sweeping actions to address rising rates of autism.

								&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health announced Monday it will break from federal guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine and endorse the recommendations of medical associations instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s panel of vaccine advisers opted not to give any recommendation on the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead it’s an individual choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/?p=3755105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine advisers change COVID shot guidance, calling them an individual choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices this year and replace them with his handpicked appointees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, MDH officials are endorsing the advice of three independent medical associations: the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836/AAP-recommends-all-young-and-high-risk-children?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, these associations recommend that all people six months and older should be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine unhindered, with strong recommendations for children from six to 23 months, pregnant women, and children and adults with high-risk conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said her agency is “following the science” by endorsing the advice of these health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a unique moment where vaccine information from federal health leaders leaves important information gaps for Minnesotans,” Cunningham said. “These independent medical associations have all looked at the science and concluded that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective and important for people across the lifespan.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/health-medical/as-trump-administration-clamps-down-on-vaccines-walz-signs-order-to-expand-access/"&gt;As Trump administration clamps down on vaccines, Walz signs order to expand access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/hcp/pharmacists.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standing orders for pharmacists&lt;/a&gt;, comes after Gov.

Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

			&lt;p&gt;What gives rise to human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="175128" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;? Are some parts of the brain more important than others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists began tackling these questions in more depth about 35 years ago. Researchers have made progress, but the mystery of consciousness remains very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;recently published article&lt;/a&gt;, I reviewed over 100 years of neuroscience research to see if some brain regions are more important than others for consciousness. What I found suggests scientists who study consciousness may have been undervaluing the most ancient regions of human brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;defined by neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; as the ability to have subjective experience, such as the experience of tasting an apple or of seeing the redness of its skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-consciousness-work-duelling-scientists-tested-two-big-theories-but-found-no-winner-255610"&gt;theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the outer layer of the human brain, called the cortex (in blue in figure 1), is fundamental to consciousness. This is mostly composed of the neocortex, which is newer in our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human subcortex (figure 1, brown/beige), underneath the neocortex, has not changed much in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438824000400?via%3Dihub"&gt;last 500 million years&lt;/a&gt;. It is thought to be like electricity for a TV, necessary for consciousness, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another part of the brain that some neuroscientific theories of consciousness state &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44"&gt;is irrelevant&lt;/a&gt; for consciousness. This is the cerebellum, which is also older than the neocortex and looks like a little brain tucked in the back of the skull (figure 1, purple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HumanBrainCerebellumCortexSubcortex-e1758598683378.jpeg" alt="Diagram of human brain showing the positions of the Cortex, Subcortex and Cerebellum" class="wp-image-175133 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1, the human brain (made with the assistance of AI). (Peter Coppola/CC BY SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain activity and brain networks are disrupted in unconsciousness (like in a coma). &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;These changes&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What brain stimulation reveals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of my analysis, I looked at studies showing what happens to consciousness when brain activity is changed, for example, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632334/"&gt;applying electrical currents&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94051-5#Sec2"&gt;magnetic pulses&lt;/a&gt; to brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments in humans and animals showed that altering activity in any of these three parts of the brain can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;alter consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Changing the activity of the neocortex can change your sense of self, make you hallucinate, or affect your judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the subcortex may have extreme effects. We can &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199905133401905"&gt;induce depression&lt;/a&gt;, wake a monkey from anaesthesia, or knock a mouse unconscious. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Even stimulating the cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, long considered irrelevant, can change your conscious sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this research does not allow us to reach strong conclusions about where consciousness comes from, as stimulating one brain region may affect another region. Like unplugging the TV from the socket, we might be changing the conditions that support consciousness, but not the mechanisms of consciousness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I looked at some evidence from patients to see if it would help resolve this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage from physical trauma or lack of oxygen to the brain can disrupt your experience. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Injury to the neocortex&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://karger.com/ene/article-abstract/84/3/157/125434/Cognitive-and-Behavioral-Disorders-in-Patients?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;make you think&lt;/a&gt; your hand is not yours, fail to notice things on one side of your visual field, or become more impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born without the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614135/"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5964834"&gt;the front of their cortex&lt;/a&gt;, can still appear conscious and live quite normal lives. However, damaging the cerebellum &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211002061?via%3Dihub"&gt;later in life&lt;/a&gt; can trigger hallucinations or change your emotions completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm to the most ancient parts of our brain can directly cause unconsciousness (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/126/7/1524/299341?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;although some people recover&lt;/a&gt;) or death. However, like electricity for a TV, the subcortex may be just keeping the newer cortex "online", which may be giving rise to consciousness. So I wanted to know whether, alternatively, there is evidence that the most ancient regions are sufficient for consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rare cases of children being born without most or all of their neocortex. According to medical textbooks, these people should be in a permanent vegetative state. However, there &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;are reports&lt;/a&gt; that these people can feel upset, play, recognize people, or show enjoyment of music. This suggests that they are having some sort of conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reports are striking evidence that suggests maybe the oldest parts of the brain are enough for basic consciousness. Or maybe, when you are born without a cortex, the older parts of the brain adapt to take on some of the roles of the newer parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some extreme experiments on animals that can help us reach a conclusion. Across mammals – from rats to cats to monkeys – surgically removing the neocortex leaves them &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1999.tb00621.x"&gt;still capable&lt;/a&gt; of an astonishing number of things. They can play, show emotions, groom themselves, parent their young, and even learn. Surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425003343?via%3Dihub"&gt;even adult animals&lt;/a&gt; that underwent this surgery showed similar behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the view that the cortex is necessary for consciousness, as most major theories of consciousness suggest. It seems that the oldest parts of the brain are enough for some basic forms of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer parts of the brain – as well as the cerebellum – seem to expand and refine your consciousness. This means we may have to review our theories of consciousness. In turn, this may influence patient care as well as how we think about animal rights. In fact, consciousness might be more common than we realized.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264609/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/tylenol-autism-trump-rfk-pregnant-fever-n0w3fv7t0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen — known in Britain as paracetamol, and the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of concerns it may increase the risk of autism in unborn children. But millions of mothers use paracetamol to manage pain and fevers during their pregnancies because it’s the only drug available to them to safely do so. Or at least, that’s what they’ve been told for the past few decades, but apparently no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HHS’ rationale for the new Tylenol warning is based on a systematic review led by Harvard Dean of Public Health Andrea Baccarelli. Dr. Baccarelli’s &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-announcement-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; contends that there is a “strong, consistent association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ADHD/ASD/other NDDs”. The review emphasised that this result was exceptionally robust, that it stood strong in studies controlling for bundles of different confounders, with negative control exposure periods, and with propensity score matching. The only problem is that &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/you-cant-just-control-for-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;none of these methods&lt;/a&gt; are reliable and the authors actually ignored some good evidence that contradicts their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main failing point of the review is that its authors knew about good evidence in the form of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;sibling control studies&lt;/a&gt; — studies where scientists compare a sibling who is exposed to Tylenol &lt;i&gt;in utero &lt;/i&gt;to a sibling who wasn’t exposed to it — and they ignored those results. But those studies were the strongest; it just happens to be the case that those studies didn’t find anything alarming. To me, that seems like the correct explanation for why the authors were &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/174283509/does-tylenol-cause-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;so gung-ho&lt;/a&gt; to attack them on spurious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest, highest-quality &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used almost 2.5 million births from Sweden between 1995 and 2019, used great measures of Tylenol exposure in a country where most Tylenol use is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13003" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by prescription&lt;/a&gt;, and they found much the same as the other non-causal studies: mothers who used more Tylenol during pregnancy have children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders more often. But they went further than replicating that purely correlational association. In fact, they showed that, when comparing differentially exposed siblings, the one exposed to Tylenol was no more likely to have any disorder than the one who was not exposed. In other words, the association isn’t causal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="94" data-end="388"&gt;The review was plagued by non-sequiturs. It cited weak evidence as if it were strong. The authors failed to quantitatively synthesise the findings of the studies they referenced. Worse, they botched the table entries and even cited studies in ways directly contradicted by the studies themselves. The review was lazy, but it ostensibly supports what some people really want to believe: that Tylenol causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bastardised faux-science masquerading as real information, millions of pregnant women will be scared into avoiding Tylenol or any brand of paracetamol, even when it might be the drug they need. Mothers who need to break a fever or manage pain have no alternatives: opiates aren’t acceptable, and Ibuprofen isn’t safe before foetuses have undergone about two trimesters of growth. If it were true that Tylenol is causing autism, then there might be some debate to be had about the risk-reward calculus for letting pregnant women use it, but there isn’t. The science is abundantly clear: Tylenol &lt;i&gt;does not &lt;/i&gt;cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our public health authorities get scientific questions wrong, suffering follows. Who will cry out for the mothers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                                                        &lt;hr&gt;

                            &lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p class="staticendofarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is one reason, aside from cultural and religious considerations, some people kick off their shoes at the door. But while gross, the germs on your shoes are unlikely to cause illness, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a small, widely cited study, researchers found that fecal bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, which can make you sick if they are ingested or make their way into a cut in your skin, were commonly present on the bottoms of shoes. And when those shoes came into contact with clean flooring, 90-99 percent of the bacteria were transferred to it. (The study was not peer reviewed and was funded by a shoe company marketing washable shoes.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The first three or four steps when you walk in the house are the most contaminated on the floor because you’re bringing all that stuff from outside and walking on the floors,” said Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other studies have reported that &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can also be found on the bottoms of shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We live in a germy world,” and bacteria and viruses can be found on nearly any object, including our shoes, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. But there aren’t any instances in the scientific literature of pathogens being transmitted from the soles of shoes to noses or mouths in high enough numbers to initiate infections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That’s why we don’t have public health recommendations that people sanitize their shoes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Schaffner, who sometimes wears street shoes in his own home, said it is more notable that “our hands can pick up germs, and then we touch our mouths, noses and eyes. That’s the mode of inoculation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Going shoeless at home has another benefit, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When you wear shoes all the time, it may lead to deconditioning of the deeper muscles of the foot, said Amiethab Aiyer, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in foot and ankle conditions at Johns Hopkins. “Their relative strength and relative conditioning could lapse over time,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From the perspective of maintaining strength and conditioning of the musculature in the feet, and to avoid the germ elements, it may be helpful to not wear shoes around the house,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From a cultural perspective, Aiyer, who is Indian American, said he and his family do not wear shoes in the house, both for cleanliness and out of respect for the home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, some people shouldn’t go barefoot at home. For example, if you have poor circulation or conditions such as neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the feet that can be caused by diabetes or chemotherapy, it can lead to the loss of protective sensation that may affect your ability to detect objects under foot, Aiyer said. Additionally, people who are at increased risk of falling may need traction or improved perceived balance that shoes can provide, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_else_you_should_know" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

However, if you are concerned about dirt or germs, here are tips from experts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-wash shoes with soap and warm water to remove dirt and debris, particularly from the soles of shoes. Mix water with a small amount of dish soap and a washing powder (sodium carbonate), and give the bottoms “a good thorough scrub with a strong bristle brush,” said Zachary Pozniak, co-owner of Jeeves New York, a dry cleaning and shoe cleaning and repair service. Insoles that are removable can be handwashed and air-dried before placing them back in the shoe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disinfect the soles with a spray or wipe to help kill germs. Look for products registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to kill particular pathogens such as norovirus, a highly contagious germ that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness. For better control when using disinfectant sprays, spray a clean towel with the solution and wipe the soles of the shoes rather than spraying directly onto the shoe, Pozniak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Machine wash shoes only when the manufacturer label states so. Before washing shoes in the machine, pretreat stains by hand in the sink, Pozniak said. Do not wash materials such as leather or suede.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air dry unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Clothes dryers can ruin shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bottom line: Our shoes can carry germs into the house, but they alone are unlikely to cause illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBxY19mS05OOXcyRC1tZl9vMS1HQ0VmWXJXdk41VVdySTVBdFRpaHl6eW5xVnpuR2hQd1Fsd3JCVUl5UjZfTDR5c09vbGktTy1jRV9SNmFySGg4a2FyMC0xWDdhMlVKT1hCMEI0a2xOTGtDZUVONXY0</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的研究人员表示，美国的耐药“噩梦细菌”病例正在上升-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome," said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-resistant-infections-new-antibiotics-needed-high-cost-preventing-development/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-become-a-bigger-killer-than-cancer-60-minutes-2019-04-21/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance," said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections "is definitely underestimated," Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

But one reported infection in the Bear River Health Department district, which encompasses Box Elder, Cache and Rich counties, shows the highly contagious disease has spread north months after the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Officials say people in the area may have been exposed to the virus at the Chick-fil-A off of State Road 165 in Providence, in Cache County, if they were there between 6:30-9 p.m. on Sep. 11. Those at the Budge Clinic, 1350 N 500 East in Logan, between 3-6:30 p.m. on Sep. 15 may have also been exposed, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department says those exposed at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the restaurant should watch for symptoms — like a high fever and cough, or a rash — through Oct. 2, and those exposed at the clinic should be on the lookout through Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Cache County is the fourth county that the department has confirmed cases in during the current outbreak, which began in June with a single&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;case in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Of the confirmed measles cases, 25 have been in the Southwest Utah district (consisting of Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington Counties), three in the Southeast district (Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan counties), seven in Utah County and one in the Bear River district, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Three of those districts — Bear River, Utah County and Southwest Utah — have also seen &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/"&gt;measles in their wastewater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;within the past month, the health department reports. These other districts without confirmed cases have also found measles in sewage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Davis County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salt Lake County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summit County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TriCounty, which consists of Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Wastewater in the Central Utah and the San Juan districts has not been tested, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Dr. Leisha Nolen, the state’s epidemiologist, said the wastewater&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;results mean people should be aware that measles could be found in areas of the state without confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are active symptom watches in effect for those who visited the Chick-fil-A and clinic in Cache County, as well as for individuals who were at Water Canyon High School, in Hildale in Washington County, on Sep. 3. That watch in southern Utah ends Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Sep. 16, there were 1,491 confirmed measles cases in 42 jurisdictions across the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Last year, the CDC says the U.S. saw only 285 cases. Weekly cases throughout the nation spiked this year in March, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear within one to two weeks of exposure, according to the health department, and can consist of a high fever and cough, runny nose or red eyes. After four days of fever, the department says a rash will normally appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those who develop symptoms should stay away from other people and call their healthcare provider before going to their doctor, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The best way to prevent measles, according to the health department, is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine from their healthcare provider.

At the end of the study, the average score increased by almost three points, from 25 pre-test to 27.7 post-test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessments are required and a person may have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro-walking positively influences cognitive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances executive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also highlight that cognitive impairment is becoming more common among older adults, driven by the aging global population and the increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a beneficial effect on cognitive health, retro walking has also been found to have many other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glazier and Dr Ko wrote: '&lt;span&gt;It can strengthen the muscles in the back; increase strength and flexibility in the hamstrings; strengthen the ankles; improve balance, posture and coordination; and even ease lower back pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to a decreased range of motion in the knees and hips, retro walking can be kinder to those joints.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking backward can also increase the energy you use by 40 percent, upping calorie burn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And without being able to see in front of you, your body has to rely more on something called proprioception, the built-in sense of where you are in space. This can fine turn coordination and stability and strengthen your ability to focus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better stability and balance is crucial in older adults as it can prevent falls and the potentially deadly complications that result.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing his top five health hacks for helping to slow down aging in his brain and hopefully reduce his risk of dementia, Bain-Kim, who founded the start-up Lifeforce, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-startup-founder-habits-to-protect-brain-aging-alzheimers-2025-9"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; he relies on specific diets and workouts, as well as supplements and sound sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular exercise boosts blood flow to the brain to help clear out substances that could cause dementia, and quality sleep can also help the brain clear out potentially harmful deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research has shown that certain diets or lifestyle habits can also boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, Daily Mail details the longevity expert's top tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine, long popular with bodybuilders, is now attracting fans looking to boost their cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplement is made from three amino acids, glycine, arginine and methionine,  and provides extra fuel to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies suggest that this extra fuel could also be used by the brain, with the energy potentially helping to fend off cognitive decline and protect against stress caused by sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40395689/"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found dementia patients who took 20 grams of creatine a day for eight weeks had a slight increase in cognitive function compared to those who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim believes that people already take far too many supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid its potential brain health effects, he said he added this supplement to his daily routine because he felt it might help to lower his risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine is widely available in powder and pill forms, with users advised to take around three to five grams per day. One serving costs as little as 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA does not regulate creatine supplements, and experts urge people to buy the supplement from a reputable source to reduce the risk of it also containing impurities or ingredients that could be harmful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In previous cases, some creatine supplements have been&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://goliathlabs.com/blogs/articles/does-creatine-have-lead?srsltid=AfmBOoon6xbI3QoKZnvT83tXUZJvLhETvj85ggEQbljcBUpxv-ib4gRu"&gt; found to contain&lt;/a&gt; trace amounts of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And people with kidney disease, affecting about 37million Americans, are advised to consult with their doctor before taking the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of Ozempic. Bain-Kim says he microdoses on the drug to boost his brain health and longevity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MICRODOSING OZEMPIC&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing weight while on Ozempic and similar drugs can boost heart health and slash the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some studies have also suggested that taking the drugs could help to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836412?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that patients who take liraglutide and semaglutide, the active ingredients in Mounjaro and Ozempic, have a lower risk of dementia compared to those not on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also some evidence that it may slow down brain shrinkage, a normal part of aging that begins around age 40 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim said he started to take a GLP-1 medication after hearing about this potential benefit, and he now microdoses one of the weight loss drugs, though he did not specify which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microdosing is when someone takes a very small amount of a drug in order to benefit from its effects while minimizing any risks or side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether the benefit is linked to improvements caused by weight loss or to the drugs themselves, but experts say that maintaining a healthy weight can help to reduce someone's risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE LIGHT CARDIO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that more time spent exercising can help to flush substances out of the brain that may raise the risk of suffering from dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has overwhelmingly shown that exercising can help to reduce the risk of dementia by boosting blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some experts now say that doing more Zone 2 cardio exercises, such as running at a pace where you can maintain a conversation, can be more beneficial than pushing yourself to your maximum capacity in every workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible that focusing on Zone 2 cardio can lead to people exercising for longer periods, boosting blood flow to the brain over a longer time period, which can help to flush out substances that could cause dementia and boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim still lifts weights but said he recently doubled down on the lighter cardio, such as light jogging or biking, to improve his brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He does two sessions of light cardio every week, he said, and plays competitive pickleball regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zone 2 cardio is equivalent to exercising at about 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maximum heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from the number 220. This means that a 30-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute and a Zone 2 heart rate of around 113 to 132 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;FOLLOW THE 'MIND' DIET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have touted the Mediterranean diet as a way to boost cognitive health for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Bain-Kim says he recently switched to the Mediterranean-Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MIND is an eating plan developed by Harvard researchers to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested it can slow decline, including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 1,000 adults that showed slower cognitive decline among those on the diet compared to those not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302368"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; on the diet that tracked 2,000 cognitively unimpaired people for three years found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain size between those on and not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MIND diet emphasizes fibers and healthy fats such as omega-3s that can support brain health by helping the brain form and maintain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet consists of at least six servings of leafy greens, at least five servings of nuts, at least four of beans, two or more servings of berries and one serving of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel or sardines per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on the diet also use olive oil as their primary cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this diet may reduce the risk of dementia by cutting inflammation levels and improving the health of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE QUALITY SLEEP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep is also being touted as a way to prevent dementia, with experts saying it can also remove potentially dangerous toxins from the brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep has recently become the cornerstone of every 'longevity athlete's' fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Bain-Kim is no exception, saying that for peak health and performance he tries to sleep about seven hours and 45 minutes every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tracks with the CDC's recommendation, which states everyone needs between seven and nine hours every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone appreciates a good night's sleep, but for me that's now core to my strategy because of the brain protection benefits of getting enough sleep,' he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's become the non-negotiable for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest sleep can help ward off dementia by allowing the brain to clear harmful proteins, such as beta-amyloid, which build up in the organ during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-may-nudge-the-brain-toward-dementia-researchers-find-265216"&gt;study found this month&lt;/a&gt; that people suffering from chronic insomnia, or struggling to sleep, were twice as likely to develop dementia as healthy adults who slept normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They found that millennials — born between 1981 and 1996 — appear to be aging biologically faster than previous generations, based on biomarkers in blood that indicate the health of various organs. That acceleration was associated with a significantly increased risk — up to 42 percent — for certain cancers, especially those of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" data-contentid="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Much of the work in this area is in its early stages and has not proved a direct cause and effect in humans. The evidence comes from epidemiological studies, which look at patterns of disease in large populations; observational studies, which track people’s behaviors and exposures without intervening; and animal models which are sometimes, but not always, good proxies for people. Such research is difficult to interpret and especially prone to overstatement or misreading of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Ad" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Ad/Ad.js" data-style="stitches" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-icAbLfl-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="LVWUOP2BZJB3XK2BPCT4RWXITU" data-contentid="LVWUOP2BZJB3XK2BPCT4RWXITU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and population health at Stanford University, said research that searches for correlations across large datasets is highly susceptible to producing spurious results.

Women giving birth in the second half of the 20th century were treated with drugs not as an exception, but a new standard.

However, as researchers revisit this era with new methods and by examining how events unfolded over an extended period&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;— and with the discovery of the link between morning sickness drug thalidomide and birth defects in the 1960s — a more complicated story has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Ad" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Ad/Ad.js" data-style="stitches" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-icAbLfl-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="RQBY262QMJAIVA4655BPD7APV4" data-contentid="RQBY262QMJAIVA4655BPD7APV4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;What if a drug’s real risk may not be apparent in the days or weeks after birth, but only show years — or possibly decades — later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7CDNC2RQ6JGE7EMA7F3OP3QJX4" data-contentid="7CDNC2RQ6JGE7EMA7F3OP3QJX4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Caitlin Murphy, a professor and cancer epidemiologist at the University of Chicago, found herself wrestling with exactly this question.

The mid-century period, Murphy knew, was a golden age of medical intervention in pregnancy: a time when hormonal treatments, sedatives and experimental drugs were widely prescribed to expectant mothers, often with little long-term follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="TIL6AOEM2VGRHKYJ5IQ7CISOAE" data-contentid="TIL6AOEM2VGRHKYJ5IQ7CISOAE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;By linking these prenatal medical records to statewide cancer registries, Murphy determined that children whose mothers had taken bendectin, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jncics/article/7/2/pkad021/7071583?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;an anti-nausea drug&lt;/a&gt;, during pregnancy were 3.6 times more likely to develop colon cancer as adults, when all other factors were taken into consideration. Even more startling was that children of women who received &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/featured-science-from-endo-2021/drug-used-during-pregnancy-may-increase-cancer-risk-in-mothers-adult-children?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;a different medication to prevent miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, had more than double the overall lifetime cancer risk.

The emergence of new drugs that slightly slow its progression, along with the discovery of biomarkers that pave the way for &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-03-11/scientists-develop-early-detection-video-game-for-alzheimers-and-dementia-symptoms.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-03-11/scientists-develop-early-detection-video-game-for-alzheimers-and-dementia-symptoms.html"&gt;early detection&lt;/a&gt;, has renewed hope for tackling a condition that affects 50 million people worldwide. After decades of setbacks and the failure to find effective treatments for a dementia that destroys memory and individual autonomy, the scientific community is watching with anticipation the diagnostic and pharmacological revolution underway. A panel of experts published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease"&gt;series of articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday detailing these advances, while also addressing the major controversy surrounding the new treatments — the first to alter the course of the disease, but criticized for being expensive, having side effects, and showing only modest efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Juan Fortea, head of the Neurobiology of Dementia group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and co-author of one of the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; articles, says Alzheimer’s research is at a “paradigm shift.” “We are not curing the disease,” he clarifies, “but it is the first time in human history that we have managed to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The driving force behind this scientific turning point is a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html"&gt;new generation of drugs&lt;/a&gt; that eliminate beta-amyloid protein, which accumulates in diseased brains, and slow disease progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Albert Lleó, head of Neurology at Sant Pau in Barcelona, emphasizes that this is just “the beginning of the journey”: “There are 138 more drugs under investigation. These are the first of many to come.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Researchers are also exploring, for example, the potential of semaglutide, which has already revolutionized obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The drugs that have raised all hopes are called lecanemab and donanemab. In clinical trials, the first slowed disease progression by 27%, and the second by 35%. Both are approved in the United States and other countries, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA), more conservative, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html"&gt;took time to approve lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; (giving approval a year ago after initially rejecting it) and is still reviewing donanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Both drugs have been surrounded by controversy, even within the scientific community. First, because of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html"&gt;potential side effects&lt;/a&gt; — for example, lecanemab has been linked to cerebral hemorrhages and the deaths of two patients — but also because of doubts about the clinical benefit: what does reducing disease progression by 27% really mean for a family’s day-to-day life? Other concerns include the price (estimated at around $25,000 per patient per year) and the fact that the drugs are only intended for very specific patients in the very early stages of the disease, with specific characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; series, the authors — some of whom disclosed conflicts of interest due to ties with the pharmaceutical companies producing these drugs — analyze this “range of reactions” and the “skepticism” these drugs generated in the scientific community, asking whether the same would have happened with other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They even compare efficacy, cost, and impact of the new Alzheimer’s drugs with those of other biologic drugs for different conditions. For instance, with lecanemab and donanemab, serious adverse effects occurred in 1 in 300 and 1 in 65 patients, respectively; but in trials of pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy) for lung cancer, side effects occurred in 27% of cases. Another comparison: the reduction in disability from anti-amyloid drugs in Alzheimer’s is similar to that observed in trials of biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Based on the history of other biologic drugs in different diseases, the authors argue that the magnitude of effect may be very similar. In those cases, they note, prices were also high and the drugs were not free of side effects. Regarding the limited access to a very specific group of patients — experts estimate that for now only 5% of people with Alzheimer’s will benefit — the authors point out that in multiple sclerosis, for example, the use of innovative drugs was limited to 36% of patients in 2017 and rose to 74% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“What these authors are putting forward isn’t a direct comparison with other diseases, but rather a demonstration that there are other therapies in medicine that have a comparable magnitude of effect, but Alzheimer’s has characteristics that undervalue these advances,” says David Pérez, head of Neurology at the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Madrid, who was not involved in this series. He refers to a handful of factors, ranging from scientific skepticism to social prejudices, which have created a climate conducive to controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Pérez notes, for example, that the history of Alzheimer’s drug development has been “bumpy,” marked by successive failures that planted a seed of distrust in the scientific community. The controversy over aducanumab, a drug approved in the U.S. under controversial circumstances but which failed commercially and was later withdrawn by the manufacturer, did not help. “It was approved in a twisted way, without clear benefit, and that generated an atmosphere of mistrust,” Pérez explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Nihilism and ageism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There is also “a lot of nihilism” surrounding this disease, says Lleó: “Many times, the diagnosis is not made accurately, and since there is no treatment, the public feels no need to demand a diagnosis or timelines the way they do for stroke or cancer. Sometimes, the symptoms are considered part of normal aging. All of this contributes to the perception of a disease in which there is little that can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Another factor affecting the debate, according to Pérez, is ageism: “This is a disease that primarily affects older people, who cannot raise their voices and demand anything from society. These patients are a vulnerable group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The scale of the disease, the experts consulted add, has also fueled doubts at the policy and regulatory level. “If it weren’t such a prevalent disease, if it didn’t cause a strain on the healthcare system, on costs, and on procedural changes, some of the controversy wouldn’t have arisen. If it were a rare disease, we have little doubt that this would have been approved without any controversy and very quickly,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This first generation of drugs presents a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html"&gt;challenge for healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;. Both in identifying patients who can benefit — which requires diagnostic and biomarker tests to confirm the disease, as well as genetic studies to rule out incompatible mutations — and in the treatment and follow-up itself: the therapy is intravenous, administered in a day hospital, and requires regular MRIs to monitor for potential hemorrhages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Seeing patients in outpatient consultations, once every six months or once a year, is one thing; lecanemab treatment is another. It involves infusions every two weeks in a day hospital, plus four MRIs per year and numerous visits… A patient goes from one or two relatively short visits per year to 24, 30, or 35 visits. Imagine the workload this represents. It will be challenging for the system to adapt, but since it will [initially] involve only a minority of patients, the system can gradually adjust,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The experts consulted emphasize that potential side effects are manageable. Regarding clinical benefit, Fortea notes that “that 30% translates into the patient gaining six months over 18 months.” In other words: “To progress to the next phase, you progress 30% more slowly. You maintain more autonomy and quality of life because we are slowing a disease that causes significant disability. We are not curing the disease. Patients get worse, but at a slower pace,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an interview with EL PAÍS, Cristina Maragall, president of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation, argued that for both the scientific community and families, “it is essential that these medications begin to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Diagnostic revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Therapeutic advances, however, are only one part of this scientific transformation shaking up Alzheimer’s research. The other pillar — diagnostics — is also advancing by leaps and bounds, particularly with the development of biomarkers that identify biological traces of the disease ever earlier. The authors estimate that the arrival of plasma biomarkers, which detect traces of the disease in the blood — with a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html"&gt;simple blood draw, like a routine test&lt;/a&gt;, biochemical signals of the disease can be identified — “will lead to a new diagnostic revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;These tools are “crucial” for confirming the diagnosis at all stages of the disease, says Fortea. He explains that when clinical evaluation and neuropsychological testing confirm mild cognitive impairment, in 60% of cases it will be Alzheimer’s, but in the remaining 40% it will not; and depending on the situation, the patient’s progression and prognosis will be very different. “Therefore, I absolutely need a biomarker to identify who has Alzheimer’s. Otherwise, I won’t know what’s happening,” he says. According to Fortea, in asymptomatic contexts, the only way to select individuals who have Alzheimer’s will also be the biomarker. “The day there are preventive treatments, that biomarker will be our only tool to identify these people,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Fortea is very optimistic about the med-term advances: “We can now diagnose the presence of proteins [related to Alzheimer’s] in the brain of cognitively healthy people. We still can’t predict with certainty whether or when all of these people who have these proteins in their brains will develop the disease, and that’s why population screening isn’t recommended, but this isn’t science fiction. These are clinical trials that are underway and will be published in 2027. In two years, we’ll know if removing amyloid in people without symptoms slows the onset of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;If this is the case, he says, “conducting &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html"&gt;population screenings&lt;/a&gt; and trying to prevent it would be justified.” “We’re not there yet, but we have diagnostic tools that work and clinical trials are underway. This doesn’t end with these two approved drugs; there are many more to come, not only in these stages of the disease but in others as well. The disease in five years may be unrecognizable from the perspective of how we treat it, prevent it, and what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Experts also predict more advances in the field of prevention. In fact, a scientific review identified 14 risk factors — including smoking, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, and pollution — to avoid in order to prevent nearly half of all dementia cases. “There is potential in prevention,” argues Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, ISGlobal researcher and author of one of the articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet &lt;/i&gt;series: “We have already seen a study that has shown that a lifestyle intervention — physical exercise, nutrition, cognitive and social activity — has an impact on cognitive decline in people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:18:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>您什么时候需要接种流感疫苗？根据美国疾病控制与预防中心（ CDC ）的数据，现在是最佳时机- AL.com</title><link>https://www.al.com/news/2025/09/when-do-you-need-to-get-your-flu-shot-heres-the-best-time-according-to-cdc.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NRXTS2V42VABFIPSREBCFWKHEE"&gt;The best way to prevent the flu and serious complications is by getting a flu vaccination every season.

It is advised to consider September through October as the prime time for flu vaccinations. Receiving the vaccine in July and August is not recommended, except in specific cases where the person will not be able to get the shot in September or October, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should get the flu vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PQU3K62W3JFVHNLCJPH5PZRL6A"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7305a1.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that everyone 6 months or older receive a flu vaccine. The effectiveness of the vaccine varies depending on how closely the virus strains in the vaccine match those currently circulating. However, the CDC says vaccination is the most important protection from contracting influenza and potential complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What flu vaccine options are available? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5W5SCASSRHNRO4FHW5CWWBTDM"&gt;There are a few choices when it comes to available flu vaccines offered at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health clinics. Trivalent influenza vaccines, which protect against three different strains of the virus, are recommended for all age groups. However, those over 65 are at a higher risk of complications from the flu so the CDC recommends an enhanced vaccine to provide better protection. The Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray vaccination option last year called FluMist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CMLHKZ74YJF7NGSFKNGIWPKD54"&gt;For those with egg allergies, the vaccine is available in egg-free formulations.

Well, a recent report from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm about the rising prevalence of the biting insects in the United States and the potentially deadly disease they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say Chagas disease should be declared endemic in the U.S. because it is now a constant occurrence. The disease is caused by a parasite spread in the droppings of infected triatomine insects, commonly known as kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is not spread person to person, but it can spread through contaminated blood, organs, food and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs got their name because they usually bite people in the face and around the mouth area at night while they’re asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/allergy/video/why-ragweed-allergy-symptoms-may-be-worse-in-fall" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs were once mostly found in the tropics, but with climate change causing warmer temperatures around the globe, the blood-sucking insects are now more prevalent in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; says kissing bugs have been found in 32 states, mostly in the South. Chagas disease has been found in pets like cats and dogs, as well zoo and wild animals in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in eight states: Texas, California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts point out that because the disease is not well known and doctors aren’t looking for it, cases are likely significantly higher. The nature of the disease also contributes to the unknown number of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate symptoms of Chagas disease can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the infection can linger for years, and many people will not show any of those symptoms. About 20% to 30% of those who get the disease will develop much more serious problems like an enlarged heart, colon or esophagus, heart failure and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/news/climate/video/tropical-trees-help-cool-the-planet-climate-change" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s caught early, Chagas disease can be treated with two types of antiparastic medication.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korean researchers have uncovered compelling evidence that oral bacteria, once colonized in the gut, can affect neurons in the brain and potentially trigger Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The joint research team, led by Professor Ara Koh and doctoral candidate Hyunji Park of POSTECH's Department of Life Sciences, together with Professor Yunjong Lee and doctoral candidate Jiwon Cheon of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, collaborated with Professor Han-Joon Kim of Seoul National University College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oral+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oral bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1–2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases. Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson's differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of Streptococcus mutans—a well-known oral bacterium that causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dental+caries/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental caries&lt;/a&gt;—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, S. mutans produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced S. mutans into the gut or engineered E. coli to express UrdA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt;, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson's symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/motor+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt;, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease," said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It highlights the potential of targeting the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson's treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

However, more research is needed before it becomes a standard recommendation. For now, it works best as a supportive measure, not a stand-alone predictor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key takeaway is simple: a larger neck size may signal higher cardiovascular risk, particularly in men and in individuals with existing health issues. It should encourage deeper evaluation, lifestyle changes, and timely medical guidance rather than cause panic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我们的宝宝直到8个月才完全健康—现在他可能会在10岁时死于一种罕见的疾病，即使他的神经科医生从未听说过-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/baby-totally-healthy-until-8-120000426.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jack Drury came out swinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Born at just 33 weeks, the preemie shocked doctors by breathing on his own and leaving the NICU for his New Jersey home just 17 days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They reassured us that he would be fine,” his mom, Kelsey Drury, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And for a while, he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Drury is the only child of Tim and Kelsey Drury. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But over time, Jack stopped hitting milestones — and the joy of early triumph gave way to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then came the devastating news: The Drurys’ only child had a rare, terminal disease so aggressive, most kids don’t live to see their 10th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was having dreams of planning his funeral,” said Kelsey, 34, recalling the dark days after Jack’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, against all odds, there’s a flicker of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In New Jersey, a grassroots group is racing to launch the first clinical trial for a gene therapy that could give Jack — and others like him — a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Early signs, growing concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys first noticed something was off around 8 months, when Jack still hadn’t rolled over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He just kind of laid there and played, batting at objects that were above him,” Kelsey said. “Cognitively, he was there, he would laugh and look at you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, it was easy to dismiss — Jack was born two months early, and preemies often &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Preemie-Milestones.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take longer to meet developmental milestones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;take longer to meet developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack developed normally until a few months before turning 1. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He was right on target as far as fine motor skills and babbling,” Kelsey said. “But that was around the same time we started to notice that he was progressively getting more and more delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys enrolled Jack in feeding, physical and occupational therapy at 10 months, but no one could explain why he was falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We would do hours of PT, then go home and work on exercises. There was no progress at all,” Kelsey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Eventually, he just never crawled,” she added. Instead, he mastered “butt scooting” to get around their South Amboy home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At 18 months, things took a turn. Suddenly, Jack couldn’t put weight on his legs, let alone walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, children with Jack’s disease lose their motor skills. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I used to call him spaghetti man because when we’d try to get him to stand, his legs just collapsed,” Kelsey said. “That’s when we grew concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Hope and despair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family was referred to a neurologist for genetic testing — but the lab lost Jack’s samples. For six long months, the Drurys were left in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,” said Tim Drury, Jack’s father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On July 1, a month after Jack turned 2, they got the diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/infantile-neuroaxonal-dystrophy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy&lt;/a&gt; (INAD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;INAD is a rare genetic disorder that causes fat-like substances to accumulate on the nerves, disrupting signals and slowly stripping children of muscle control, vision, speech and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For a child to have INAD, both parents must pass on a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene. Carrier screening is available, but the process can be complex because INAD is so infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease. Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed, according to the &lt;a href="https://rarediseases.org/organizations/inadcure-foundation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Organization for Rare Disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Organization for Rare Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are just a handful of children in the US living with INAD. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diagnosis was crushing — a disease so rare, even their own doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Not only did we not know about it, but the neurologist who shared the genetic results with us admitted she hadn’t heard of it before,” Tim, 37, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their pediatrician and therapists were just as clueless. But one doctor had heard about the &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:INADcure Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;INADcure Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed the Drurys in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It turns out, out of all the places in the world, the only foundation looking toward a potential treatment — and aiming for a cure — is based right here in New Jersey,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, the nonprofit has worked with scientists to develop a gene therapy designed to deliver a healthy copy of the PLA2G6 gene — the one affected by INAD — to the cells that need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The goal is to address the root cause of INAD, with the hope of slowing or stabilizing disease progression,” &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/mission/ourteam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Leena Panwala;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Leena Panwala&lt;/a&gt;, the foundation’s founder and president, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy treatments for INAD are showing promise. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the time the Drurys connected with the organization, preclinical trials in mice had shown promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Those that received the treatment did well, had longer lifespans and showed more motor function compared to the mice that didn’t,” said &lt;a href="https://www.atlantichealth.org/find-a-doctor/darius-adams-1972506749" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Darius Adams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Darius Adams&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical and biochemical geneticist on the foundation’s Scientific Medical Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The nonprofit signed a deal with a drug manufacturer to produce the treatment, with Adams expressing “cautious optimism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Facing the unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One major hurdle remained: The foundation needed $450,000 to pay the manufacturer before the gene therapy could be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys funneled their emotions into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drurys live in South Amboy, NJ.

Kelsey expected them to receive a trickle of donations — not a tidal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It took us six days to close the gap on the $450,000,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What started as gifts from family and friends quickly snowballed into support from the community and even celebrities like “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Danielle Cabral and Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The INADcure Foundation is waiting on FDA approval to launch the clinical trial, with enrollment set to begin as soon as it gets the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They have a goal to start this early next year,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But with just 10 spots available, his son’s place isn’t guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Jack is one of the younger participants globally that they’re aware of, so I think there’s certainly potential that he’ll be part of this study,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The treatment will cost about $200,000 per child. Jack’s Miracle Mission is working to raise $2 million to cover the full cost of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack continues to go to physical, occupational and speech therapy weekly. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For children like Jack, knowing that this is a degenerative disease, they will lose skills and they’ll never get them back,” Tim said, noting that Jack can no longer scoot and is now struggling to hold his bottle and feed himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We need therapy for Jack to start as soon as possible,” Tim stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the treatment isn’t a cure, it could buy patients more time as the search for one continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Slowing progression could help children retain abilities longer, reduce complications and improve quality of life — outcomes that matter profoundly to families,” said Panwala, whose daughter has INAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Joy amid uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As they wait to learn whether Jack will secure a spot in the trial, the Drurys have shifted their focus to making every day with their son count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the Drurys’ son could die by age 10. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We all have a time that eventually ends,” Tim said. “Jack’s might be shorter than most of ours, but I want to fill the time that he does have here with as much love and joy as I can possibly provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Jack, that means “Baby Shark” on repeat, impromptu dance parties, Ms. Rachel on TV and belly laughs so hard they give him hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Kelsey and Tim, it’s in every smile, every snuggle — and the outpouring of love from strangers who’ve rallied for their little boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You see a lot of headlines in the news today about all of the hardships people face and the evil things that people do, but there’s an incredible side of humanity that we’ve been opened up to,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People have the capacity to do incredibly kind things for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOYWtqMF92U1k5TXdwdERDVDA3Y2c2d21JOFpTSkpndXBaRHdWU0ZYNnNEYXJmRW9QVGROdUtFdGlYRDVRUmlxcDR0LU1zZEV4cTdNLUd1TFlOUnhEam1LWEY3WTBkN19MRlFoZXBrMGg3MlJHeDFaTGlTUy1RaW55WVhEOTF0Zw</guid></item><item><title>如果让人们在家里穿上发芽的鞋子，会发生什么-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/23/shoes-spread-germs-house/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJDYOM5DTJH4JPC7RQ7SASCGIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is it true that your shoes can spread germs to the floors in your home and make you sick?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:45:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPTFpmakFSVC1oSFdpN016ang2azNaLTY3eEdPdE5VZ3Vnb0hDU1Nma0UwMzRRNlgxWnU4S2p4S0lMQUgwaG91U3JuZ1NuOTRULXVFV0hUUXJBUFVZOFNiRUtsMHNVY2FyazBkemhSTlpjOGw3Qy1sX0JnNmZqV2pWTXVn</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州南部大草原犬死亡疑似瘟疫- KKTV</title><link>https://www.kktv.com/2025/09/23/plague-suspected-southern-colorado-county-following-mass-prairie-dog-die-off/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LA PLATA COUNTY, Colo. (KKTV) - A mass die-off of prairie dogs in a Colorado county has health officials concerned that it could be the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;La Plata County Public Health Department (LPCPH) announced Monday that it was investigating several once-active prairie dog colonies where there was now little to no activity detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While for many, the word “plague” conjures up images of plague doctors and the “Bring Out Your Dead” scene from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” the scourge of 14th century Europe remains alive and thriving in 21st century America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But unlike the time of the Black Death, in modern times the plague is highly manageable if caught and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The plague bacterium -- commonly bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic -- can be transmitted by fleas and wild rodents, so animal die-offs like what is suspected in La Plata County with the prairie dogs can be a huge red flag that the plague is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is frequently detected in rock squirrels, prairie dogs, wood rats, and other species of ground squirrels and chipmunks,” LPCPH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s often caused due to fleas and so fleas can be carried on animals such as rodents, prairie dogs, our pets like dogs and cats, and then when [animals] come around humans, when we interact with them, [fleas] will jump off and they will bite the individual and then that’s how the individual will get plague,” a health official explained to 11 News last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LPCPH said it first became aware of the prairie dog die-off in August. To date, no confirmed testing has been done, but the department’s observations at the colonies over the last several weeks led it to release its concerns to the public Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Public health staff conducted an onsite investigation leading to suspicion of plague presence in the area,” it said in a news release. “... There may be additional plague exposures in public areas and on private land that we are not yet aware of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The health department is advising the public not to take matters into its own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Residents should not eradicate or kill prairie dogs on their property as this increases the risk of exposure to plague-infested fleas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Instead, it advises people to adhere to the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Wear repellant and appropriate clothing when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Keep pets away from wildlife and protected from fleas with veterinarian-approved topical medications, flea collars, or other methods of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Avoid sleeping alongside your pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not feed or handle wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not handle dead animals or animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Treat known rodent sites around your home with flea powder or a suitable insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms of plague include sudden fever and chills, severe headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and feeling ill. Plague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated quickly to avoid serious complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since pets can contract the plague and pass it on to their humans, the health department says to alert your veterinarian immediately if your pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or an abscess or swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Most human cases of the plague in the United States occur in western states: California, southern Oregon, western Neasa, northern New Mexico, northern Arizona and southern Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;No human cases of the plague have been reported in Colorado this year.

There are also a probable 10 additional cases and deaths, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 September, the DRC’s Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the &lt;i&gt;Zaire ebolavirus&lt;/i&gt;, the most dangerous and common of Ebola virus strains, which was also responsible for the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has issued a call for US$21 million to support the response of the DRC’s government. The agency says that priorities are sending health workers to affected communities, identifying cases as early as possible, increasing community engagement, providing treatment and reducing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A viral leap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the precise source of the outbreak is not known, researchers say that it probably arose from a spillover event, in which the virus transfers from an infected animal, such as a bat, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not identical to previous strains that have been identified, which strongly suggests that it’s a new spillover event,” says epidemiologist Peter Horby of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is currently confined to four regions of Kasai province: Bulape, Mweka, Mushenge and Kakenge. These areas are remote and isolated, making it challenging for responders to reach them, Horby says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the big problem is that the patients — because it’s an isolated area and it’s very rural — are presenting very late, with quite advanced disease and have very restricted health-care systems, so the mortality rate is very high,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this makes tackling the outbreak difficult, “the remoteness may shield the outbreak [from] other settings”, says Henry Kyobe Bosa, who leads the Ebola and COVID-19 response for Uganda’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"When in reference to sexually transmitted infections," explains Dr. Melissa Suarez, an obstetrics and gynecology physician with Inspira Health in New Jersey, it is specifically &lt;em&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/em&gt; that causes infection in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"About 80% of people with chlamydia don't develop symptoms," notes Dr. Michael Shen, an internal medicine physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Brooklyn. But when symptoms do occur, they typically appear within one to several weeks after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These may include pain or &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/23/what-causes-kidney-stones/84266272007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;burning during urination&lt;/a&gt;, abnormal discharge such as mucus or pus from the penis or vagina, pain at the cervix ("the deepest part of the vagina that leads to the uterus," explains Shen), testicular or rectal pain and in some cases, infection of the uterus that causes lower abdominal pain and fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because the infection is so frequently asymptomatic, routine testing is essential. Diagnosis usually involves a laboratory test that detects the bacterium’s genetic material from either DNA or RNA. These tests can be performed on urine samples or swabs taken from the vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum or throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Left untreated, chlamydia can cause serious complications, particularly in women. These include pelvic inflammatory disease, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/09/17/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-shortage/74529722007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;chronic pelvic pain&lt;/a&gt;, ectopic pregnancy and even infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How do you get chlamydia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The bacteria that cause chlamydia spread through direct contact, "most commonly during sexual interactions including, but not limited to, vaginal, anal and oral sex," says Suarez. Less common but still important routes of transmission include mother-to-child spread during childbirth, which can cause &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/01/23/is-pink-eye-contagious/77687115007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;eye infections&lt;/a&gt; or pneumonia in newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because of how chlamydia is spread, it can infect extragenital sites such as the rectum and throat, especially if these areas are exposed during sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Certain groups face higher risk of transmitting or getting chlamydia, including adolescents and young adults, people with multiple or new sexual partners, those who do not &lt;a href="/in-depth/life/health-wellness/2022/05/15/healthy-sex-daily-experts-google/9617807002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;use condoms consistently&lt;/a&gt; and individuals whose partners have STIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How is chlamydia treated? Is chlamydia curable? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Chlamydia is treatable and curable with antibiotics that are "usually taken for about a week," says Shen. With proper treatment, most infections clear within one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It is important to complete the full course of the antibiotic, and recent sexual partners should also be notified and treated to prevent reinfection or further spread, says Alexander. People undergoing a course of treatment should abstain from sexual activity until they and their partners have finished medication and all symptoms have resolved. "Individuals are re-tested between four weeks to three months later to confirm that reinfection has not occurred," says Suarez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While antibiotics eliminate the infection itself, supportive measures can ease discomfort until the medication takes effect. Over-the-counter &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/01/06/is-tylenol-an-nsaid/77112041007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;pain relievers&lt;/a&gt;, warm compresses or heating pads for abdominal or pelvic pain, staying hydrated and getting adequate rest can help manage symptoms in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, chlamydia is one of the most common STIs, but it is also one of the easiest to diagnose and cure. "You can decrease your risk," says Shen, "by using condoms consistently, having a sexual safety conversation with new partners and doing regular STI testing with your doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:06:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNWnJNWHUxSlpJVzMyNlhHMEczb3d2NjN5aTV4ci1JV09sMGhFUGhXT00tREd1Rm1GQ09qc2NZWTN0bUFOUzR1T3VqdHU0bWZSYnFJOXZoRElqMFJSR1lxUmlCS0RVck1oVTVMNHlrRTlPUzY5TG5HTFgzNTdscE1DcG9oMEpUamswODdOQzN6Sk5DdEg0VGNmdg</guid></item><item><title>生姜真的能缓解胃部不适吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/well/eat/ginger-upset-stomach-nausea-vomiting.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPeVp1eVdIclBzaDhBcFA0UWE3ZFpCOVRmekRncXBfbGhiRTFrdUdObFBGSWNIYWFYYmlWZW9zVFFrczB2c3lwUURuLTl4eHpIcjlIS2lLdFlBVHVLZTRIVS1zcWFsRkJDb2tCTTFqaG9iVi01anN2a0VXRHVWMHdhSUlHYjlYWG1JQkJhdnR3</guid></item><item><title>长寿规则对女性来说是不同的吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/well/women-longevity-advice.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1jQnZseWJBQVJaaXM2LTlFYnVKMDFSMnI0MGJaUTc5OGVkblN2QnBhQ0NnckE0TEx1NU54dGs4aG5hZms1OGMzM0NTeVVCaXhjdFg5RjJseDZWOFgxb3l0R0lQSlRXU1BDNnd0QnZaU29hNnROa3c</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现被忽视的痴呆症贡献者- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-uncover-overlooked-contributor-to-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new model of vascular dementia reveals hidden disease processes and raises urgent questions about the role of microplastics in brain health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia, a form of cognitive decline caused by disease in the brain’s small blood vessels, is common but has been studied less intensively than &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, which is marked by abnormal plaques and protein tangles in neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A University of New Mexico researcher aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper highlighted by the editors of the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, Elaine Bearer, MD, PhD, the Harvey Family Endowed and Distinguished Professor in the UNM School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology, introduces a framework to define and classify different types of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes the approach will help researchers better understand the disease’s variants and speed the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multiple Risk Factors and New Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes have been linked to vascular dementia, but other contributing causes, including &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-scientist-devises-new-way-to-identify-microplastics-in-brain-tissue-from-dementia-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the recent discovery of significant quantities of nano– and microplastics in human brains&lt;/a&gt;, remain poorly understood, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been flying blind,” she said. “The various vascular pathologies have not been comprehensively defined, so we haven’t known what we’re treating. And we didn’t know that nano– and microplastics were in the picture, because we couldn’t see them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer identified 10 different disease processes that contribute to vascular-based brain injury, typically by causing oxygen or nutrient deficiency, leakage of blood serum, and inflammation or decreased waste elimination. These cause tiny strokes that harm neurons. She lists new and existing experimental techniques, including special stains and novel microscopy, to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the paper, Bearer used a specialized microscope to meticulously study tissue from a repository of brains donated by the families of New Mexicans who had died with dementia, employing stains that highlighted the damaged blood vessels. Surprisingly, many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease also had disease in the small blood vessels of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suspect that in New Mexico maybe a half of our Alzheimer’s people also have vascular disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Toward Better Diagnosis and Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer contends a methodical approach to identifying different forms of vascular dementia will help neurologists and neuropathologists more accurately score the severity of the disease in both living and deceased patients and advance the search for potential treatments — and even cures. To make that happen, the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_8b74678badcaea2726bdd807c7d5f988" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; (NIH) has raised the possibility of forming a consensus group of leading neuropathologists to work out a new classification and scoring system, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a fresh area of concern is the unknown health consequences of nano– and microplastics in the brain, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nanoplastics in the brain represent a new player on the field of brain pathology,” she said. “All our current thinking about Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias needs to be revised in light of this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I’m finding is that there’s a lot more plastics in demented people than in normal subjects,” she said. “It seems to correlate with the degree and type of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of plastics also was associated with higher levels of inflammation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer’s work builds on years of collaboration with Gary Rosenberg, MD, professor of Neurology and director of the UNM Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), which &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-alzheimers-research-grant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;won a five-year $21.7 million NIH grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that supported Bearer’s research. Rosenberg, a longtime chair of the UNM Department of Neurology and also director of the UNM Center for Memory &amp;amp; Aging, has published extensively on the association of vascular disease with dementia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we started thinking about putting this ADRC together, I thought one of the things I should look at is the vasculature, because nobody’s done it systematically and comprehensively, and we have a world’s expert here at UNM,” Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Describing the pathological changes in this comprehensive way is really new. What I’m hoping will come out of this paper is working with other neuropathology ADRC cores across the country to develop consensus guidelines for classifying vascular changes and the impact of nano– and microplastics on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This versatile high-protein dip is the perfect companion for your favorite veggies.

Whether served as an appetizer or a quick snack, this protein-packed Caesar dip makes eating more veggies effortless.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This cottage cheese snack jar is a high-protein snack that layers creamy cottage cheese with crunchy bell peppers and crispy chickpeas. Cottage cheese provides protein and calcium, while chickpeas add extra plant-based protein and fiber to keep you feeling full until your next meal. A sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning brings bold flavors in every bite.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This easy, high-protein snack tastes just like a Reese’s peanut butter cup. You can conveniently make it in the yogurt container for quick cleanup. Alternatively, if you don’t have a single-serve container, scoop 1/2 cup yogurt from a larger container into a small bowl. Any nut or seed butter would work well in this four-ingredient recipe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Create a creamy on-the-go snack by combining protein-packed cottage cheese with sweet chopped peaches. When peaches are out of season, opt for frozen or experiment with an alternative such as chopped strawberries or orange segments. Elevate the flavor profile by adding a hint of vanilla extract or cinnamon to the cottage cheese. For those with a sweet tooth, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup is the perfect finishing touch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With a focus on fiber-rich beans, vegetables and healthy fats, this creamy bean dip is suitable for those following the Mediterranean diet. Tangy sun-dried tomatoes add a pop of acidity and make this dip reminiscent of Marry Me Chicken. We use carrots, peppers, radishes and snap peas for dunking, but you can use your favorite crunchy veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk and Greek-style yogurt provide a solid protein base for this chocolate-strawberry protein shake. Sweet strawberries, sliced banana and rich cocoa powder create a sweet flavor without needing any added sugar. Tossing in a few ice cubes chills the shake down and gives it a refreshing, frosty texture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pumpkin pie spice energy balls are everything you could want in a snack: classic pumpkin spice flavor with a satisfyingly chewy texture with bits of crunch from seeds and nuts throughout. It’s worth seeking out cashew or almond butter to make these—they have a more neutral flavor that lets the spices and pumpkin shine, but any nut butter will work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This blueberry-banana peanut butter parfait is a delicious layered breakfast that combines fruit, yogurt and nutty goodness. Sliced bananas and juicy blueberries are stacked between creamy yogurt and swirls of peanut butter for a sweet and satisfying meal. Chunky peanut butter adds a bit of crunch for extra texture, but smooth peanut butter blends in beautifully if you prefer a silkier bite.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tomato toast features a creamy ricotta cheese spread and, of course, juicy ripe summer tomatoes. A serrated knife makes cutting thin slices of the heirloom tomatoes easier when they are on the softer side. If you have cherry tomatoes on hand, they will work well too, either sliced or blistered under the broiler.

                One emerging hypothesis explaining food allergies is that food particles first get into the body through a disrupted skin barrier, and the immune system in turn tags food proteins as an invader—something to be fought.

   &lt;p&gt;Food allergies have risen in the United States over the last few decades. Research suggests that 40 years ago the prevalence of food allergies was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1323893016301137" target="_blank"&gt;less than 1%&lt;/a&gt;. But today that number is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm" target="_blank"&gt;closer to 6%&lt;/a&gt;. But this trend is not present in all countries — and what people are allergic to varies globally.

Paying attention to subtle changes and acting promptly is the best defence against colon cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Subtle' warning signs of bowel cancer are 'often overlooked', Dr Jack Ogden (pictured), a GP at The Lagom Clinic in Bristol, told the Daily Mail &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dame Deborah James, nicknamed the 'bowel babe' raised more than £11.3mn for Cancer Research and is credited for increasing awareness of the disease, which killed her in 2022 aged 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first, commonly overlooked sign is iron deficiency anemia, which can present as 'unexplained fatigue, pale skin or shortness of breath', Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anemia is a condition when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to pump oxygen around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause symptoms like chest pain, heart palpitations, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because tumours can bleed, causing iron loss and cause inflammation that produces a protein which interferes with iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, constipation, diarrhoea, or suddenly noticing narrower stools with no clear cause, is another key easy-to-dismiss subtle bowel cancer sign, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pencil-thin stools can be an indicator that a tumour is obstructing the colon causing it to squeeze stool into a thinner shape, Dr Ogden added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, losing weight without changing diet or exercising more is the third pain free sign, that may indicate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, he said it doesn't have to be sudden—it can also be subtle or gradual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often this weight loss can be caused by increased metabolic demand, loss of appetite and tumours preventing the absorption of nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating and abdominal discomfort, equally, is the fourth 'subtle' sign of the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may present itself as 'persistent cramping' or feel full quickly after eating, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fifth sign, he warned, was blood in the stool—which isn't always necessarily as obvious as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood can be dark or hidden and only detectable via stool tests, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If stools are dark red or black it can be a sign bleeding is taking place higher up in the bowel due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, bright red blood is most commonly caused by haemorrhoids, also known as piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, anyone experiencing these symptoms for three weeks or more is advised to speak to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;James Van Der Beek, who lives in Texas , revealed in November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023, aged just 46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel cancer symptoms can also be caused by other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, but it's important to get checked so the disease can be spotted as early as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the vast majority of bowel cancer diagnoses affect those aged over 50, rates in older age-groups has either declined or held stable while diagnoses in younger adults have risen by 50 per cent over the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates that over half (54 per cent) of bowel cancer cases in the UK are preventable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have suggested obesity, antibiotic over-use, mobile phone radiation and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water are potential triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent global review found rates of colorectal cancer—also known as bowel cancer —in under-50s are climbing in 27 out of 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England has one of the steepest increases, with cases in younger adults rising by an average of 3.6 per cent a year, while in the US, the rate is going up by around two per cent annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we sleep, the body releases its '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"&gt;growth hormone&lt;/a&gt;', building up and repairing muscles and bones – but the details of how and why have been something of a mystery, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of brain circuitry in mice, researchers led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) have found special mechanisms and feedback loops that regulate growth hormone release &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;while we sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could help us better treat conditions that come with sleep problems, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174439" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delayed-rem-sleep-may-be-an-early-signal-of-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding sleep is the key to understanding a whole host of aspects of our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;Better Sleep Could Help Your Brain Flush Out Dementia-Linked Toxins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Xinlu Ding, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg" alt="Mouse experiments diagram" class="wp-image-174442 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed the release of growth hormone in mice during sleep/wake cycles. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That directly recorded neural activity, logged during multiple sleep-wake cycles in mice, revealed that growth hormone was released in different ways during &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"&gt;REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt; and non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While growth hormone was increased in both phases, the neurons promoting and inhibiting its production shifted in terms of their influence. There was also a feedback loop involving neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain linked to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Daniel Silverman. "Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair, and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides its main job – promoting growth – growth hormone manages how glucose and fat are processed in the body. Without the right amount of the hormone, through a lack of sleep, the risk of obesity, diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; can increase. That adds to the number of ways that the new discoveries could be linked to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the locus coeruleus also plays a part in managing how alert the brain is while we're awake. It's possible that the mechanisms revealed here are affecting cognition &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/where-does-brain-fog-come-from-new-evidence-could-solve-the-mystery"&gt;during the day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more research is needed to determine all this for sure, and while there's good reason to believe that human brains and mice brains operate in the same way in these areas, it still needs to be proven. Ultimately though, new treatments for poor sleep could follow, which is something so many of us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type. This circuit could be a novel handle to try to dial back the excitability of the locus coeruleus, which hasn't been talked about before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h1 itemprop="headline"&gt;Bat Found In Local Residence Tests Positive For Rabies&lt;/h1&gt;
                    
                        &lt;h6&gt;By Craig Manning
                             | 
                                Sept. 23, 2025&lt;/h6&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) announced on Monday that a bat recently found inside a local residence had tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services had tested the bat for rabies “after possible human exposure.” Per a GTCHD press release, “all individuals identified as exposed” are now receiving “the necessary post-exposure medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread through bites or scratches from infected animals, rabies is a virus that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the CDC describes&lt;/a&gt; as “deadly if people don’t receive medical care before symptoms start.” However, because the rabies virus needs to travel all the way to the brain before symptoms emerge, the virus has a lengthy incubation period during which it can be prevented. The CDC website notes that roughly 100,000 Americans are vaccinated against the virus each year, following potential or confirmed exposures. Comparatively, fewer than 10 deaths from the virus are reported each year in the United States, thanks to vaccination and prompt medical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid rabies exposure, GTCHD recommends avoiding contact with wild animals, particularly those with higher likelihood of carrying the rabies virus, including bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Other recommendations include keeping pets vaccinated against the virus, sealing openings in the home that might allow bats to gain entry, and never handling bats or other wild animals with bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where people do find bats in their home, they are urged not to release the animal back into the wild, but to “safely contain the bat without directly handling it in any way and contact GTCHD at 231-995-6051 to discuss testing and possible exposure.” Those who believe they have been bitten or scratched by an animal, or who have had any contact with a bat, should seek medical attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the GTCHD press release, this bat is the 33rd in Michigan to have tested positive for rabies this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="88" data-end="216"&gt;I’ve noticed a funny pattern among people (myself included): certain tiny, non-negotiable rituals reveal a lot about who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="218" data-end="261"&gt;Case in point? The die-hard night showerer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;If you absolutely must rinse off before your head hits the pillow—no matter how busy, tired, or late it is—there’s a good chance the traits below will feel familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;Think of this as a mirror, not a verdict. Use it to understand yourself better, and maybe to smile at how delightfully consistent you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="569" data-end="583"&gt;Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="585" data-end="611"&gt;1. You thrive on ritual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="613" data-end="745"&gt;Do you get oddly calm the moment steam fills the bathroom and the day starts sliding off your shoulders? That’s the power of ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;Night showerers often have a built-in “shutdown sequence.” It’s not just about getting clean; it’s the predictable cue that tells your brain, “We’re done here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/you-do-not-rise-to-the-level-of-your-goals-you-fall-to-the-level-of-your-systems"&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1060" data-end="1235"&gt;Your shower is a system—reliable, repeatable, and stabilizing. Even if your day was chaos, this one habit stays the same, and that steadiness quietly supports everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1237" data-end="1281"&gt;2. You genuinely care about sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;If you swear that you sleep better after a warm rinse, you’re not imagining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;A warm shower or bath an hour or two before bedtime can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/3495/"&gt;help your body cool itself afterward&lt;/a&gt;—a signal that it’s time to sleep—leading to faster sleep onset and potentially better sleep efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1718" data-end="1875"&gt;The nightly shower says you don’t treat sleep like an afterthought. You protect it. You set it up. You respect that tomorrow’s focus begins the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1877" data-end="1910"&gt;3. You’re highly sensory-aware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;Clean skin. Fresh pajamas. Cool sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;For many night showerers, the textures and temperatures matter. You likely notice small bodily cues—residue from sunscreen, sweat from a commute, a hint of smoke from that restaurant—and want a reset before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2165" data-end="2319"&gt;That sensitivity isn’t “picky;” it’s data. You use it to make your environment work for you. And when your senses feel settled, your mind can settle, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2321" data-end="2385"&gt;4. You’re big on boundaries (even if you don’t announce them)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;I used to work as a financial analyst, and back then I brought the office home in my head—even after I stopped bringing home the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;Switching off was hard. When I started writing, I kept the habit of a firm evening shower. It’s my line in the sand: emails go silent, decisions can wait, and my time becomes my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;If you’re a nightly shower person, you probably do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;The shower is your door-closing moment—no drama, no speeches, just a quiet boundary that says, “Today is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2891" data-end="2923"&gt;5. You’re a planner by nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Rituals make planning easier. Maybe you set out tomorrow’s clothes after drying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Maybe you do your skincare, refill the water on your nightstand, and cue up an alarm. There’s a sequencing to your evening, and the shower anchors it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3162" data-end="3325"&gt;This doesn’t mean you’re rigid. It means you’re intentional. You know that small, consistent steps—wash, wind down, lights out—beat last-minute sprints every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3327" data-end="3364"&gt;6. You self-soothe in healthy ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;Stress relief doesn’t need to look heroic. It can look like turning the water a degree warmer and letting your shoulders drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;The shower is a miniature sensory deprivation chamber: white noise, steady warmth, no notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;I’ve had entire plot knots for articles untangle in those five minutes. The combo of solitude and sensory comfort is restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;You’re not numbing out; you’re resetting your nervous system without burning hours or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3819" data-end="3903"&gt;7. You hold yourself to personal standards (and they’re yours, not anyone else’s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Some people feel fine climbing into bed with the day’s dust. Others—maybe you—just can’t. It’s not about judgment; it’s about alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Your actions match your internal standards, and that builds quiet self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;Author &lt;a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast/podcast-episode-little-happier-outer-order-contributes-to-inner-calm/"&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/a&gt; says, “Outer order contributes to inner calm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;A nightly shower is “outer order” at its simplest. It’s a tidy, tactile way to say, “I take care of me.” That message compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4405" data-end="4439"&gt;8. You carve out micro-solitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;If you’re a parent, caregiver, manager, or the go-to person in your group, uninterrupted minutes are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;The shower is often the only guaranteed alone time you get all day. No one is asking for snacks, numbers, or answers in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;This micro-solitude is more than a break. It’s a brief return to yourself—thinking your own thoughts, processing your own feelings, catching up with your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;People who always shower at night understand the value of those tiny pockets of privacy and guard them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4957" data-end="5013"&gt;9. You’re consistent because it’s part of who you are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;Here’s what I see with clients and readers who are steadfast night showerers: the habit isn’t powered by willpower anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;It’s identity. You’re “the kind of person who wraps the day with a rinse,” full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;Identity-based habits are durable. When life gets messy, you still do the thing—not because someone told you to, not because an app reminded you, but because it’s who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;That consistency leaks into other areas: you follow through, you keep promises, you show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5501" data-end="5549"&gt;A few everyday payoffs you probably recognize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5551" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5551" data-end="5679"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5553" data-end="5679"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5553" data-end="5573"&gt;Better mornings.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s less rushing because you’ve already handled hygiene and prep. You start cleaner, lighter, calmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5680" data-end="5840"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5682" data-end="5840"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5682" data-end="5708"&gt;Fewer friction points.&lt;/strong&gt; No debating whether to shower before coffee, breakfast, or that early meeting. One less decision means more brain for what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5841" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5843" data-end="5973"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5843" data-end="5866"&gt;Improved self-talk.&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds small, but doing what you said you’d do—every single night—nudges you toward “I can rely on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5975" data-end="6000"&gt;Common myths to ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6002" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6002" data-end="6162"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6004" data-end="6162"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6004" data-end="6035"&gt;“Night showers waste time.”&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, they often save time by bundling wind-down, stress relief, and hygiene into one ritual—freeing up morning bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6163" data-end="6320"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6165" data-end="6320"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6165" data-end="6197"&gt;“It’s just a hygiene thing.”&lt;/strong&gt; Hygiene is part of it, sure, but the deeper value is psychological: boundary-setting, sensory regulation, and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6321" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6323" data-end="6493"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6323" data-end="6368"&gt;“Real discipline means morning routines.”&lt;/strong&gt; Real discipline means routines that work. For you. If your evening structure is what keeps the wheels on, that’s discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6495" data-end="6544"&gt;How to make your night shower work even harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6546" data-end="6609"&gt;If you’re already committed, a few tiny tweaks can level it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6611" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6611" data-end="6741"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6741"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6613" data-end="6647"&gt;Keep it short and intentional.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for the minimum time that makes you feel reset. You’re after restoration, not rumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6742" data-end="6942"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6744" data-end="6942"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6744" data-end="6788"&gt;Pair it with a single “tomorrow” action.&lt;/strong&gt; After toweling off, place your running shoes by the door, load the coffee maker, or put your badge in your bag. The habit stacking makes mornings easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6943" data-end="7092"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6945" data-end="7092"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6945" data-end="6981"&gt;Let scent do some heavy lifting.&lt;/strong&gt; A consistent, mild scent (think eucalyptus or unscented if you’re sensitive) can become a sleep cue over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7093" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7095" data-end="7212"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7095" data-end="7131"&gt;Choose a final “lights-out” cue.&lt;/strong&gt; After the shower: dim lamps, one page of a book, then bed. The sequence matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7214" data-end="7238"&gt;A quick personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;Trail running is my happy place. It also means dirt under my fingernails and the occasional splash of creek water on my calves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;On those evenings, the shower isn’t optional—it’s a reunion with myself. As the mud swirls down the drain, so does the mental clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;I step out feeling like I’ve returned to my baseline. If you know that feeling, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7594" data-end="7610"&gt;Final thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7612" data-end="7822"&gt;If you always shower before bed, you’re not just “particular.” You’re building a life scaffolded by small, meaningful actions that help you think clearly, sleep deeply, and show up as the person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7824" data-end="7906"&gt;And that’s the bigger story: not hygiene, but identity. Not steam, but self-trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7908" data-end="7919"&gt;Sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications used many years earlier can still influence the human gut microbiome, according to a large-scale study conducted by the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined stool samples and prescription records from more than 2,500 participants in the Estonian Biobank’s Microbiome cohort and discovered that most medications tested were associated with shifts in gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these changes persisted for years after patients had stopped taking the drugs. The influence was not confined to antibiotics; antidepressants, beta-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and benzodiazepines also left lasting microbial “fingerprints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Importance of medication history in microbiome research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences,” said Dr. Oliver Aasmets, lead author. This highlights that it is critical to account for drug usage history when studying links between the microbiome and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_494685" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494685" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-494685" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-777x518.jpg" alt="Researcher Handling Lab Samples" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-777x518.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-494685" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Credit: Karl-Erik Piirimees&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, benzodiazepines, which are commonly prescribed to treat anxiety, were found to influence the gut microbiome to a degree similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The study also revealed that medications within the same drug class, such as diazepam and alprazolam, can vary in the extent to which they disturb microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Confirmed long-term microbial shifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up samples from a subset of participants confirmed that starting or stopping certain drugs caused predictable microbial shifts, suggesting causal effects. Despite the small sample size of the second time-point analysis, the authors were able to verify long-term effects of proton pump inhibitors, selective &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_80cb7583dd5c79ce1410aa9892b052bf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;serotonin&lt;/span&gt; reuptake inhibitors, and antibiotics, such as penicillins in combination and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a comprehensive systematic evaluation of long-term medication effects on the microbiome using real-world medical health records,” said Professor Elin Org, corresponding author. “We hope this encourages researchers and clinicians to factor in medication history when interpreting microbiome data.”&lt;/p&gt;

For those in the aspirin group, there was a 7.7 percent chance of cancer coming back within the three years covered by the study. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;the placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the chances were 14.1 to 16.8 percent, depending on the type of mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karolinska Institute surgeon Anna Martling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg" alt="Cancer risk graph" class="wp-image-175096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-548x415.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-600x454.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Aspirin was linked to a lower risk of recurring cancer.

At the same time, research has also highlighted associations between aspirin and an elevated risk of other health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-the-dangers-outweigh-the-benefits-when-it-comes-to-a-daily-aspirin"&gt;including internal bleeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that cancers are already screened for critical mutations, which in this study accounted for a little over 1 in 3 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/what-is-colorectal-cancer.html"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt; – a substantial number of cases that could potentially be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Martling. "This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast, music-driven breathwork was shown to induce psychedelic-like states, shifting brain blood flow and reducing negative emotions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants described feelings of unity, bliss, and euphoria, suggesting breathwork may offer a safe, natural alternative to psychedelics in mental health treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breathwork While Listening to Music&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises performed to music may bring about feelings of deep bliss, while also altering blood flow in areas of the brain involved in processing emotions. This finding comes from a study published recently in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Amla Kartar of the Colasanti Lab in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, U.K., and her colleagues. The research showed that these changes can take place even when the body shows signs of a stress response, and they are linked with a reduction in reported negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, breathwork has become increasingly popular as a way to ease psychological distress. Certain approaches that involve faster or deeper breathing, often paired with music, can create altered states of consciousness (ASCs) similar to those brought on by psychedelic drugs. One form, known as high ventilation breathwork (HVB), may provide a drug-free option for achieving these effects, with fewer legal and ethical barriers to widespread use in therapy. Despite its growing appeal, the biological processes and personal experiences behind HVB-induced ASCs have not been studied in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exploring Altered States of Consciousness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Kartar and her team investigated how HVB produces ASCs in people with experience practicing the technique. They collected self-reported data from 15 online participants, 8 in-lab participants, and 19 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Each person completed a 20- to 30-minute session of continuous, rhythmic breathing set to music. Within half an hour after the session, participants filled out questionnaires describing their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation, as indicated by a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating a potential stress response. In addition, HVB-evoked ASCs were associated with a profound decrease in blood flow to the left operculum and posterior insula – brain regions implicated in representing the internal state of the body, including breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite HVB causing large and global reductions in blood flow to the brain, there was a progressive increase in blood flow during the session to the right amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are brain regions involved in the processing of emotional memories. These blood flow changes correlated with psychedelic experiences, demonstrating that these alterations may underlie the positive effects of this breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Oceanic Boundlessness and Psychedelic Parallels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a reduction in fear and negative emotions, with no adverse reactions. Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which is a term coined by Freud in 1920 that describes a set of related feelings including spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7a35a078a0055cdc610debfd9ae5eb2e" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, their study was novel and exploratory and requires replication by future research including larger sample sizes and a control group to separate the effects of music on the brain. Despite these limitations, the findings provide a better understanding of HVB and direct research to investigate its therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mapping the Brain During Breathwork&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Our research is the first to use neuroimaging to map the neurophysiological changes that occur during breathwork. Our key findings include that breathwork can reliably evoke profound psychedelic states. We believe that these states are linked to changes in the function of specific brain regions involved in self-awareness, and fear and emotional memory processing. We found that more profound changes in blood flow in specific brain areas were linked to deeper sensations of unity, bliss, and emotional release, collectively known as “oceanic boundlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Kartar, lead author, adds: “Conducting this research was a fantastic experience. It was thrilling to explore such a novel area – while many people anecdotally recognize the health benefits of breathwork, this style of fast-paced breathing has received very little scientific attention. We are very grateful to our participants for making this work possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Natural Path to Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alessandro Colasanti, P.I., adds: “Breathwork is a powerful yet natural tool for neuromodulation, working through the regulation of metabolism across the body and brain. It holds tremendous promise as a transformative therapeutic intervention for conditions that are often both distressing and disabling.”&lt;/p&gt;

But perhaps it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 report from the influential Lancet Commission suggests that up to one-third of AD cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00646-x"&gt;could be prevented simply by avoiding certain risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-alzheimers-day-heres-how-far-weve-come-in-search-of-a-cure"&gt;World Alzheimer's Day: Here's How Far We've Come in Search of a Cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;14 modifiable risk factors&lt;/a&gt; encompass: traumatic brain injury, hypertension,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, low physical activity levels, too much alcohol consumption, too little education, vision loss, hearing loss, social isolation, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this comprehensive list is rooted soundly in science, it's not easy for members of the general public to monitor and manage 14 separate health targets – especially when prevention efforts need to start decades before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that needs addressing. Tackling this problem requires a prevention model that is simple and memorable – something the public can easily embrace, understand, and follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are successful examples that can serve as a template. Stroke prevention associations, for instance, have successfully adopted the &lt;a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/signs-of-stroke"&gt;FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; to teach stroke warning signs. AD prevention needs a FAST equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIELD (Sleep, Head Injury prevention, Exercise, Learning, and Diet) may fill that role. SHIELD brings together the most significant, overlapping dementia risk factors into five core pillars, offering a clear and effective strategy for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a foundational element of SHIELD. Maintaining healthy sleep habits is a key protective factor against dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; supports &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-023-02229-9"&gt;brain function, memory, mood, and learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufficient (less than five hours per night) or poor-quality sleep (frequent awakenings), especially in midlife, increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Chronic poor sleep leads to a build-up in the brain of amyloid-beta protein, which is implicated in the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/IJG.0000000000001169"&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; also increases the likelihood of obesity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.20513"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and depression, all risk factors for AD. If you're currently sleeping four to five hours per night, consider changing this habit to avoid increasing your risk for developing dementia in later life. Sleep is a vital tool for brain protection and AD prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Head injury&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention is, rather surprisingly, often overlooked in conversations about dementia. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200662"&gt;strong links between traumatic brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, including concussions, and higher AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such head injuries can occur in a wide variety of settings, not just professional sports. Intimate partner violence, for example, is unfortunately common in our society and is a frequent, but neglected, cause of head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention should start early and continue throughout life, as damage can accumulate over time. Broader safety measures (such as improved helmet designs, stronger concussion protocols in youth and adult sports, and efforts to prevent head injuries in all settings) can play a significant role in protecting long-term brain health and avoiding AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A woman with grey hair using exercise equipment." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-working-out-in-a-gym-dHHcDjMcN_I"&gt;Unsplash/Centre for Ageing Better&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is perhaps the most powerful lifestyle habit for reducing the risk of AD. Exercise directly addresses multiple major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and depression. It also supports the growth of brain cells, memory and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, physical inactivity remains common, especially in high-income countries, where it &lt;a href="https://barlowbooks.com/our-books/save-your-mind/"&gt;may contribute to as many as one in five AD cases&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise is not just "heart medicine," but "brain medicine" too. Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging and can help avoid AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning, both in and out of school, remains one of the strongest protective factors against dementia. Lower educational levels, such as not finishing secondary school, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70072-2"&gt;linked to a significantly increased risk for dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning contributes to the brain's "cognitive reserve," which is the brain's ability to function well despite damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with AD &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00014"&gt;maintained better mental function&lt;/a&gt; if they had continued learning throughout life. Public health messaging should promote life-long learning in all forms – from reading and language learning to engaging hobbies that keep the brain active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never too early (or too late) to learn another language or to challenge your brain. Boosting your cognitive reserve boosts your brain against AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet also plays a major role in brain health and dementia prevention. No single food prevents dementia. Rather, a combination of nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;A healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; can lower dementia risk by emphasizing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish, while restricting processed foods, red meat, and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to dietary patterns like the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu5114566"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has shown promising results in protecting against cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is a brain/heart-healthy eating style inspired by the traditional diets of people in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasizes plant-based foods with olive oil as the primary fat source, while limiting red meat, processed foods, and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg" alt="foods in the mediterranean diet" class="wp-image-175110 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been linked with a decrease in Alzheimer's disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADm60xzS1M/"&gt;Aamulya/Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we eat influences brain inflammation and brain vascular health – all of which are increasingly tied to AD. A healthy diet shouldn't feel restrictive or like a punishment for trying to improve brain health. Instead, it can be framed as a positive investment in long-term independence, clarity, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simplifying the science, the SHIELD framework offers a realistic and research-backed approach to brain health. Until a cure is discovered, prevention is the strongest tool. Concepts like SHIELD provide a starting point for achievable prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease should not be seen as inevitable. The statistic that there will be more than 130 million people with AD by 2050 must not be accepted as predestined. With the right decisions and actions, we can work towards AD prevention by protecting the minds and memories of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Twiss, a fourth-year undergraduate student in Life Sciences at Queen's University, co-authored this story.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265053/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
