But according to the acid reflux dietician, drinking too much water too quickly, especially at meal times can also exacerbate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sip slowly—especially during meals. Think gentle hydration, not flooding your stomach,' she advised her followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Aim to hydrate between meals instead of right before or right after eating,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst drinking a glass of water with a meal is unlikely to have a negative impact for most people, it can make acid reflux symptoms worse because it increases the overall volume of the stomach's contents—putting pressure on the valve that stops stomach acid from flowing back up the oesophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kitty Broihier, a registered dietician and mindful eating instructor, drinking water with a big meal can add to stomach distension and a bloated feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that gastric distension—often referred to as bloating—increases the amount of stomach acid reaching the esophageal sphincter, and forces acidic stomach juices to come back up, causing a burning sensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the online publication &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://foodguides.com/blogs/from-the-experts/why-water-might-be-causing-your-heartburn-the-science-behind-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Food Guides&lt;/a&gt;, she warned: 'As good as water is for you, it's apparent that drinking a lot of water at once will make the distention worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same goes for drinking water during a meal,' she added. 'Don't wait until the evening to compensate for not drinking enough water during the day.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It always best to drink room temperature water, Ms Pelletier added, because water at this temperature can be absorbed more easily by the body, and is comfortably consumed without causing thermal shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're still dealing with reflux despite doing "everything right", hydration habits might be one of the missing pieces,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may be able to advise on lifestyle changes or prescribe medication and investigations to combat the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But left untreated acid reflux can lead to a condition called Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a condition which triggers some of the cells in the oesophagus to grow abnormally—increasing the risk of oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as doctors warned earlier this year that millions may be hooked on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce the amount of acid in the stomach, limiting the distressing symptoms of heartburn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when patients stop taking the tablets, which include omeprazole and lansoprazole, the reflux returns even worse than before, experts have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates between 3 and 13 per cent of Barrett's oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translate to someone with the condition having an 11-times greater risk of being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer than someone without Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, CRUK estimates about three in five of the near 9,500 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed in Britain each year are preventable. By 2040, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15035953/cancer-research-uk-shock-report-risk.html"&gt;experts predict&lt;/a&gt; there will be 147,000 cases of oesophageal cancer in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:47:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOanhya0E5ZUNSZXdwUW5DWkg4eHAzc2dFNGdSeDN2LUF0Q1R0ekEwU3djWDdydXptd1VvbzBJcXRFN2xjX3BrZ1pBTndNLUlyeGU5aF9lU2RkT2pOcFBqZGRQMGpPNVZ0SlprS2lMSU5JYjRlVi1GbW1QUGFsOHZxSXozOWdXbVlRVkUySGR3QXh4RUnSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnpmNF9oU3EwWThpUWV2NHF4UXYwOUdiZXJNeEhKWjdUOWVoM2V6UTA4WlNrUC1HRS1PLXU2dHJxREtrUU0xcFlnRWMwUDd1QVVjWFpiT016cjlWbURBT3RjN3dqNHF3R3RZMnlxVHgwQTJSWG02dDZEUnRRTFI1NzNmSy1BbHFMSkpEelFRX094SV9yMFJVdWc</guid></item><item><title>5个令人惊讶的迹象表明您可能正在心脏病发作-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/04/heart-attack-symptoms-surprising/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGZEUYDVG5GMXBGMBSAQQQ27OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One night, Lindsay Shanks sat up from bed and felt a sharp pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H7UBMEAAMJG6JBIPLXATZVJ534" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It felt like someone stabbed me right between my shoulder blades,” said Shanks, who was 37 at the time. “My hands started tingling, and I got really nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:04:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPZHNLVm1hckljZnJOSmwtV0R0WjhrdnFjeVF2LVR0ZWxvaXhBN2REVEVwb2lYdzNrQk9LejU1QnR5blpUVTZrQlU5RUpqODZvcUl1dzN6WHN1VmRLNUxCd2VMMk9pUHhMR2NlQnlfZE00emVjbUs3LVMxRkhhOUVSU2VJRFhvZFJkUzJmdw</guid></item><item><title>肌酸补充剂是否就是他们想要的一切？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526053/are-creatine-supplements-all-that-theyre-pumped-up-to-be</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements have long been popular among iron-pumping gym bros. But these days, interest in creatine has exploded, as social media influencers tout the benefits of creatine for everything from adding muscle to boosting cognition and even helping to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's the supplement of the year," wellness influencer Bobby Parrish said in a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6pYXDyK/" target="_blank"&gt;recent TikTok post&lt;/a&gt;. "Creatine is legit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a compound&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20a%20%EE%80%80compound%20that%20comes%20from%20three" target="_blank"&gt; made&lt;/a&gt; from three amino acids that your muscles use as a source of energy. Your body makes some creatine, and it also comes from red meat, chicken or fish.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But can maximizing your creatine with supplements really deliver all the health benefits influencers claim? Here's what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements can help grow muscle and improve athletic performance. Some claim it could prevent age-related bone and muscle loss, improve brain function when you're sleep deprived and boost cognition in other ways, or even protect against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Decades &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5469049/#Sec4" target="_blank"&gt;of research&lt;/a&gt; have shown that taking supplements to maximize the amount of creatine stored in muscles can help to add lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, providing quick bursts of energy to "do a few extra reps on a bench press or finish a little bit stronger in a road race," says &lt;a href="https://exss.unc.edu/faculty-staff/abbie-smith/" target="_blank"&gt;Abbie Smith-Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And combining creatine with carbohydrates can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/" target="_blank"&gt;boost endurance and speed recovery&lt;/a&gt; from a hard workout, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, you could increase your creatine stores by eating more, but "the problem with that is we're talking like 2 pounds of raw beef every day and not many people are willing to do that," says &lt;a href="https://healthsciences.nova.edu/faculty/human-performance/antonio-jose.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jose Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Hence, supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to adding lean muscle mass, Antonio says the evidence for creatine supplements is "overwhelming." They work — but Antonio says there's a big caveat: "You can't just take creatine and then you put on lean mass." In other words, you actually have to work out.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A review of 35 studies found that when creatine supplements were combined with resistance training, adult men added around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35986981/" target="_blank"&gt;2 to 3 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of lean body mass. For older people especially — since we tend to lose muscle mass as we age — that could be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6921011/#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20the%20current%20literature%20allows%20us%20to,to%20prevent%20and%20treat%20frailty%20and%20sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt;, Smith-Ryan says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also some newer research suggesting creatine supplements may help with bone health, though that evidence is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328222001442#:~:text=The%20current%20body%20of%20research,no%20exercise%20intervention%20is%20used." target="_blank"&gt;still emerging&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.pbrc.edu/news/media/2025/hannah_cabre_qa.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Cabre&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist and postdoctoral fellow at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. She notes that exercise in general helps maintain healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any time we're exercising, moving, lifting weights, the muscles are pulling on the bones, which is what actually increases their bone density. So if you're helping the muscle, you're also helping the bone," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for other potential benefits of creatine supplements — such as helping &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7915263/" target="_blank"&gt;regulate blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; in people with Type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11275561/" target="_blank"&gt;improving memory&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9" target="_blank"&gt;brain function better when you're sleep deprived&lt;/a&gt; and boosting brain health in other ways? Antonio says the early evidence suggesting those benefits "isn't strong, but it's certainly interesting."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Smith-Ryan agrees. "I would say as a scientist, I would love more data." Still, she says, if you want to try creatine supplements, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Creatine is not going to be the magic bullet," she adds. "But I do think that it's a low-hanging fruit that has minimal side effects."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antonio notes that vegans and vegetarians are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/" target="_blank"&gt;more likely to see a benefit from creatine supplementation&lt;/a&gt;, because they don't get as much, if any, creatine from their diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are taking creatine supplements to boost your performance at the gym or in the sports field, just know the boost might be small. "It's not going to make you necessarily a better baseball player or a better football player. But it will help you train harder," Antonio says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Creatine is considered very safe for adults, though if you have kidney disease, you should talk to your doctor before taking it, says &lt;a href="https://www.challiance.org/doctors/profile?n=7" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches supplement safety. He recommends buying supplements that contain creatine monohydrate — the most widely studied form — as the&lt;em&gt; only&lt;/em&gt; ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone wants to use supplements, we need to know exactly what ingredient we're getting and exactly the precise dose," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that studies have found that products sold as preworkout sports supplements can often be adulterated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10570429/" target="_blank"&gt;prohibited ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. So he says if you do try a creatine supplement, make sure it's certified by a third-party certification program; he recommends &lt;a href="https://www.nsfsport.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NSF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cohen says while creatine supplements might mean the difference between winning and losing for a competitive athlete, "for recreational activities and certainly to stay healthy for the long term, I don't personally think there's a role for creatine that's been proven as of yet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And not everyone will see a difference in their performance after supplementing with creatine. Cohen points to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2004/08000/ACUTE_CREATINE_MONOHYDRATE_SUPPLEMENTATION_.39.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;that suggests that, due to individual biological differences, as many as 20% to 30% of people won't respond to creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;If you want to try it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two strategies for getting started on creatine supplements for muscle-building benefits. One is what's called a loading dose, says Antonio, which involves taking 5 grams of creatine four times a day for seven days. This will quickly build up creatine stores in muscles, but might cause some gastrointestinal distress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why Antonio and Cabre both say they often recommend the second strategy, which is to take 5 grams of creatine daily. It will take longer for the creatine to saturate the muscles, so you need to take this daily dose for at least four and preferably eight weeks before noticing a difference in terms of lean muscle mass, says Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Once someone has been on creatine for a while, 3 to 5 grams a day is generally considered the maintenance dose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you want to try creatine, but you understand what the potential benefit is — that you might be able to do a heavy, repetitive activity a little faster and you choose to try it for that reason — that's reasonable," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NORFOLK, Va. — A Trantwood Elementary student between the ages of 5 and 12 has contracted measles, the first child in Hampton Roads and the fourth overall case in the state for this year, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;have &lt;/strong&gt;received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;have never &lt;/strong&gt;received a measles-containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries) &lt;strong&gt;you may be at risk of developing measles. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who might have been exposed and is at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider promptly to discuss questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone should watch for measles symptoms for 21 days after the date of your potential exposure&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, stay home and isolate immediately, and contact your healthcare provider right away.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need to seek healthcare, call ahead of time before going to the doctor's office or emergency room to notify them you may have been exposed, and ask them to call the local health department. This will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with an immunocompromising condition should contact their healthcare provider if they have questions or if they develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have only received &lt;strong&gt;one dose&lt;/strong&gt; of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of infection is very low. However, VDH says in order to reach the highest level of protection, you should speak with your doctor about getting a second dose of the vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles appear in two stages, VDH said. The first stage involves a fever of over 101 degrees, a runny nose, watery and red eyes, and a cough, appearing between a week and two weeks of exposure. The second stage occurs between three to five days after symptoms appear, when a rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears to four days after it appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Beach City Public Schools said the child who contracted measles attends Trantwood Elementary. Below was the letter sent to families on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trantwood Elementary School families and staff,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are writing to inform you that there was a reported case of measles at Trantwood Elementary School. The known date of onset for the illness was Tuesday, Aug. 26, the second day of school. Please refer to the letter linked here and below from the Virginia Department of Health for more detailed information about the illness and prevention measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We understand this is a very concerning situation. The health of our students and staff is of the utmost importance to us. Please know we are working very closely with the Virginia Department of Health to address this situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School is open under normal operations tomorrow for those who have been vaccinated. Unvaccinated students and staff, including those who have a medical or other exemption to vaccination, must not attend school through Sept. 16, 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson also said the student rides the bus, specifically Bus 21, which serves Trantwood, Linkhorn Park Elementary, and Lynnhaven Middle School.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

					
				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Under Governor Maura Healey’s direction, the Department of Public Health (DPH) issued a standing order Wednesday to ensure that anyone in Massachusetts over the age of 5 can get a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/tag/COVID-19-vaccine/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; booster shot despite federal limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/standing-order-for-dispensing-and-administration-of-covid-19-vaccine-2025-2026"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; authorizes pharmacists in Massachusetts to administer the COVID vaccine to “all eligible persons.” Standing orders for physicians to determine eligibility and record administration of the vaccine can be found on the DPH’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/08/27/why-getting-a-covid-19-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-more-complicated-this-year/"&gt;So far&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA has only approved the newest round of seasonal COVID vaccines for people aged 65 and older or younger people who have a health condition that makes them more vulnerable to the virus. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/05/27/rfk-jr-says-covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would no longer recommend the vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter what happens with Robert Kennedy and the federal government, we are going to make sure vaccines remain available in Massachusetts,” Healey said in a statement Wednesday. “At my direction, our Commissioner of Public Health issued an order on Friday to allow pharmacies to continue to provide COVID vaccines to Massachusetts residents. We are working to ensure that all pharmacies make the vaccine available as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new restrictions are part of a long string of anti-vaccine actions from Kennedy, who fired every member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. In August, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/08/05/kennedy-rfk-jr-pulls-500-million-in-funding-for-vaccine-development/"&gt;pulled $500 million of funding&lt;/a&gt; and canceled 22 projects to develop vaccines using mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of Kennedy’s movements against the COVID vaccine are already being felt in some states, including Massachusetts. CVS &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/08/29/cvs-holds-off-on-offering-covid-vaccines-in-16-states-including-mass/"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the pharmacy chain would not be offering the vaccine in 16 states or in the District of Columbia due to “the current regulatory environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a recommendation from the Advisory Committee has made it drastically more difficult to get a booster shot in some states. As long as the standing order remains in effect, however, pharmacists in Massachusetts will be able to administer the shot without the CDC panel’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the order, pharmacists can administer Moderna’s mNEXSPIKE vaccine and Novavax’s Nuvaxovid vaccine for people 12 and older. For children ages 5 through 11, they can administer Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine or Pfizer’s COMIRNATY vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="260" data-end="303"&gt;Trends have a funny way of circling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="305" data-end="558"&gt;What your grandparents once did to pass the time is suddenly all over TikTok and Instagram. Some of these hobbies were seen as outdated, maybe even uncool for a while—but now they’re back in the spotlight, rebranded and thriving with a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="560" data-end="612"&gt;Let’s dive into seven of the most surprising ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="619" data-end="641"&gt;1. Vinyl collecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="643" data-end="847"&gt;There was a time when vinyl was considered dead. CDs were the future, then MP3s, then streaming. But here we are again, flipping through records at local shops or digging through crates at flea markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="849" data-end="1041"&gt;For boomers, records were everyday items—just how you listened to music. For Gen Z, it’s about slowing down, owning something tangible, and celebrating music in a way that feels intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1043" data-end="1340"&gt;As Jack White once said, “Vinyl is the purest form of music you can get.” It’s less about convenience and more about ritual: sliding the record out, placing it on the turntable, and letting the needle drop. That kind of physical connection with music is something streaming just can’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1342" data-end="1641"&gt;There’s also the social side. Record fairs and independent stores have become gathering places again, not unlike the way boomers once swapped LPs with friends. I’ve been to shows where the merch table includes limited-run vinyl pressings, and it’s clear the appeal isn’t nostalgia—it’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1643" data-end="1920"&gt;It’s more than nostalgia, too. Neuroscience shows that music strongly &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/music-emotional-memory-28964/?.com"&gt;engages the amygdala and hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;—areas essential to emotional memory. That helps explain why a scratched Fleetwood Mac LP your parents played still hits differently than the same track streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1927" data-end="1949"&gt;2. Film photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1951" data-end="2100"&gt;I still remember the first time I developed photos in a darkroom back in high school. It felt like magic watching the image slowly appear on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2102" data-end="2382"&gt;For a long time, digital cameras and then smartphones made film feel unnecessary. But Gen Z is bringing it back with gusto. They’re buying vintage cameras, experimenting with expired rolls of film, and posting grainy snapshots that feel more authentic than polished iPhone pics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2384" data-end="2602"&gt;It’s not about getting the “perfect” shot—it’s about embracing imperfection, waiting to see the results, and valuing the surprise. There’s something deeply human about not being able to delete a bad photo right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2604" data-end="2798"&gt;As Susan Sontag once wrote, “All photographs are memento mori.” Gen Z seems to understand that intuitively. A film photo isn’t just an image; it’s proof of a moment, locked into physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2800" data-end="3020"&gt;The patience involved matters too. In a world of instant gratification, waiting for film to develop introduces anticipation—something psychologists link to higher dopamine release when the final result finally arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3027" data-end="3056"&gt;3. Thrifting and upcycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3058" data-end="3159"&gt;Thrift stores used to be where boomers went out of necessity. Now they’re treasure hunts for Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3161" data-end="3416"&gt;This generation has made secondhand cool again—not just for affordability but also for sustainability. They’re not just shopping thrift; they’re flipping clothes, repurposing furniture, and upcycling in ways that would make a 1970s DIY enthusiast proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3418" data-end="3639"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but the psychology of ownership changes when you’ve invested time in transforming something. That jacket you re-dyed or that chair you refinished? It’s not just yours—it’s part of your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3641" data-end="3870"&gt;Economists call this the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect?.com"&gt;“IKEA effect”&lt;/a&gt;—the tendency for people to overvalue things they’ve put effort into creating. Gen Z is applying that principle at scale, mixing fashion with identity and creativity with eco-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3872" data-end="4060"&gt;And unlike boomers, they’re sharing the process online. TikToks of thrift flips regularly get millions of views, proving that the creativity is just as important as the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4067" data-end="4082"&gt;4. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4084" data-end="4253"&gt;Boomers grew up with backyard gardens partly out of practicality. Food prices were lower when you grew it yourself, and homegrown tomatoes always tasted better anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Gen Z is rediscovering gardening too—but often for entirely different reasons. Beyond food, it’s become a mental-health ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Experimental research in the &lt;em data-start="157" data-end="187"&gt;Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found that just 30 minutes of gardening led to significantly &lt;a href="https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/gardening-promotes-neuroendocrine-and-affective-restoration-from-?.com"&gt;stronger reductions in cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (the stress hormone) and a full restoration of positive mood compared to indoor reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4521" data-end="4721"&gt;Balcony gardens, indoor herb pots, even TikToks of “cottagecore” aesthetics—all point back to something boomers did without giving it much thought: connecting to the earth and growing your own food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4723" data-end="4986"&gt;When I was traveling through Japan a few years ago, I noticed how many people maintained tiny balcony gardens in dense cities. That image stuck with me, and it’s the same trend I now see online: Gen Z carving out little sanctuaries of green in urban apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4988" data-end="5163"&gt;The beauty of this trend is that it’s not only grounding (literally), but it also taps into a sense of self-sufficiency that’s psychologically reassuring in uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5170" data-end="5199"&gt;5. Knitting and crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5201" data-end="5304"&gt;Once dismissed as something only grandmothers did, knitting and crocheting are back with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5306" data-end="5523"&gt;Scroll through Etsy or Instagram and you’ll see handmade sweaters, funky hats, and creative designs that look nothing like the beige scarves of the past. Gen Z isn’t just following patterns—they’re reinventing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5788"&gt;I picked up knitting while traveling through Iceland years ago, and there’s a kind of meditative flow to it. Loop by loop, row by row, you’re literally creating something from nothing. For a generation bombarded by screens, that slowness is a form of rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5790" data-end="6067"&gt;Clinical psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who coined the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi?.com"&gt;“flow,”&lt;/a&gt; once noted that people feel happiest when fully absorbed in an activity that challenges them just enough. Knitting is a perfect example—it’s simple but demands focus, and the payoff is tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6258"&gt;Even better, the community aspect is alive again. Online forums, TikTok “stitch clubs,” and in-person meetups have turned what was once a solitary activity into a vibrant social movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6265" data-end="6278"&gt;6. Bowling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6280" data-end="6456"&gt;Bowling alleys used to be the quintessential Friday night outing for boomers. Then they went through a bit of a decline—replaced by multiplexes, malls, and later video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6458" data-end="6663"&gt;But now? Bowling is making a comeback. Retro aesthetics, neon-lit alleys, and even boutique “luxury” bowling venues have captured Gen Z’s attention. It’s social, it’s silly, and it’s refreshingly analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6665" data-end="6971"&gt;Psychologists note that &lt;a href="https://realitypathing.com/why-do-group-activities-enhance-social-connections/?.com"&gt;group activities&lt;/a&gt; grounded in shared goals—like trying to knock down pins together—forge powerful bonds. Participating in light‑hearted, collective challenges like bowling encourages emotional cohesion and connection, especially in a generation that prioritizes experience over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7264"&gt;I was reminded of this on a trip to Portland, where a friend dragged me to a vintage-style bowling alley complete with old-school scoring sheets and craft beer. The vibe wasn’t competitive—it was collaborative, goofy, and strangely wholesome. Exactly the sort of night Gen Z is hungry for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7271" data-end="7287"&gt;7. Book clubs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7289" data-end="7517"&gt;Boomers joined book clubs to socialize, exchange ideas, and maybe drink a little wine. Gen Z is picking up that same tradition, only now it’s mixed with online communities, Discord servers, and TikTok’s famous “BookTok” trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7519" data-end="7824"&gt;I’ve seen twenty-somethings organize meetups around classics like &lt;em data-start="7585" data-end="7606"&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and contemporary works like Colleen Hoover novels. It’s less about academic analysis and more about connection—sharing emotional takeaways, swapping recommendations, and using books as a bridge to real conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="8051"&gt;As noted by author Zadie Smith, “The very reason I read is so I can live more than one life in more than one place.” Gen Z has tapped into that sentiment in a big way, turning reading into both a personal and social ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8053" data-end="8255"&gt;It’s also a reaction to digital fatigue. Reading, by its nature, forces you to focus on one narrative. When paired with a club or discussion, it satisfies two cravings at once: solitude and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8262" data-end="8280"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8282" data-end="8308"&gt;What’s old is new again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8310" data-end="8459"&gt;Gen Z isn’t simply copying boomer hobbies; they’re reimagining them through their own lens—sustainability, mindfulness, creativity, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8461" data-end="8570"&gt;It’s a reminder that trends don’t really disappear. They just wait for the right moment to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8572" data-end="8686"&gt;So maybe the next time you’re tempted to dismiss something as “outdated,” ask yourself: is it actually timeless?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 4, 2025, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/28/robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-cdc-00533906"&gt;testify before the Senate Finance Committee&lt;/a&gt;, where he is expected to face questions about his vaccine policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days prior, on Sept. 1, 2025, President Donald Trump demanded pharmaceutical companies &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/01/trump-cdc-truth-social-covid/"&gt;to prove that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the CDC was “being ripped apart over this question.” It was his first public acknowledgment of the chaos roiling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-director-monarez-out-confirmed-rfk-jr-rcna227620"&gt;amid the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent resignations of four high-level agency officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/rfk-resign-cdc-susan-monarez-fired"&gt;public health experts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5483021-hhs-employees-call-for-rfk-resignation/"&gt;HHS staffers&lt;/a&gt; are calling for Kennedy to be fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turmoil comes about a month after &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;HHS announced US$500 million in funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; for 22 research contracts on mRNA vaccine technology. The agency said it will instead pour these funds into research on a traditional approach to designing vaccines that was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/a-brief-history-of-vaccination"&gt;first used more than 200 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. With such vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.immunology.org/public-information/vaccine-resources/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine-infographics/types-covid19-vaccines"&gt;called whole-virus vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, a person’s immune system is &lt;a href="https://www.immunology.org/public-information/vaccine-resources/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine-infographics/types-covid19-vaccines"&gt;presented with the whole virus&lt;/a&gt;, often in weakened or inactivated form. This switcheroo &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5384934/trump-universal-flu-vaccine"&gt;has puzzled many scientists&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://microbiology.washington.edu/people/faculty/deborah-fuller"&gt;As a vaccinologist&lt;/a&gt; who has &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eNprtJEAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;studied and developed vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for over 35 years, I  see that the science behind mRNA vaccine technology is being widely misstated. This incorrect information is shaping long-term health policy in the U.S. – which makes it urgent to correct the record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are mRNA vaccines less safe than whole-virus vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS defended its cancellation of mRNA vaccine research based, in part, on a nonpeer-reviewed compilation of selected publications called the &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf"&gt;COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” harms research collection&lt;/a&gt;. This document lists about 750 articles claimed to describe harms caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. However, the vast majority of these articles aren’t about vaccines but about the harms of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And notably absent from it is the huge body of data &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.45602"&gt;showing mRNA vaccines actually prevent these harms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Spike proteins on SARS-COV-2 can cause tissue damage – and although mRNA vaccines produce them in small amounts, they prevent the virus from replicating to produce them in large amounts.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_medical_animation_coronavirus_structure.jpg"&gt;https://www.scientificanimations.com/wiki-images/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the document being used to justify RFK Jr.’s claims about mRNA vaccines highlights 375 studies reporting that the virus’s spike protein alone, which is produced when the virus replicates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1616106"&gt;can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage&lt;/a&gt;. This is true. But the document marshals this evidence to support the claim that mRNA vaccines, which are designed to produce spike proteins, cause the same harm – which is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While viral replication results in uncontrolled production of a large amounts of the protein, the way it’s produced by the mRNA vaccine is very different. The vaccine produces a &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2023/07/mrna-vaccine-spike-protein-differs-from-viral-version.html"&gt;small, controlled amount of spike protein inside a few cells&lt;/a&gt; – just enough to induce an immune response without causing damage. And by blocking the virus’s replication, it reduces the amount of spike protein in circulation, actually having the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about side effects like myocarditis?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports flagged a type of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/myocarditis"&gt;heart swelling called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; as a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, particularly for young men ages 18 to 25 after a booster dose. A 2024 review identified &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12101193"&gt;about 20 cases out of 1 million people&lt;/a&gt; who received the vaccine. However, that same study found that unvaccinated people had an elevenfold higher risk of getting myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, another 2024 study showed that people who &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.16380"&gt;developed myocarditis after vaccination had fewer complications&lt;/a&gt; than those who developed the condition after getting infected with COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do mRNA vaccines make the SARS-CoV-2 virus resistant?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another claim from the &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf"&gt;compilation of supposed mRNA vaccine harms&lt;/a&gt; that was cited as a reason for cutting funding for mRNA technology is that mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo"&gt;cause mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus&lt;/a&gt; that make them resistant or less susceptible to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a virus replicates in its host, it produces millions of copies of its genetic material. Mutations are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/rfk-jr-is-wrong-about-mrna-vaccines-a-scientist-explains-how-they-make-covid-less-deadly-262776"&gt;copying errors that occur naturally&lt;/a&gt; during the replication process. These acquired mutations produce new variants, which is why both the COVID-19 mRNA and the whole-virus flu vaccine get updated annually – to keep up with natural changes in the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowing down viral replication decreases the rate at which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800964-2.00017-3"&gt;a virus can acquire new mutations&lt;/a&gt;. Since both mRNA and whole-virus vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00544-9"&gt;stop or slow the virus from replicating&lt;/a&gt;, both types of vaccines help reduce the emergence of resistant viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viruses can mutate to escape from antibodies, but the mRNA vaccines are not causing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211021"&gt;the emergence of more virulent strains&lt;/a&gt;, likely for at least two reasons. First, mRNA vaccines induce immune responses that can attack the virus at multiple spots, so it would have to come up with many mutations at once to escape the vaccine’s defenses. Second, even if the virus could acquire all these mutations, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-will-not-produce-worse-variants"&gt;they would likely weaken it&lt;/a&gt;, making it unable to cause or even transmit disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;mRNA vaccines versus new SARS-CoV-2 variants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766"&gt;announcing cuts to mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; on Aug. 5, 2025, claimed that mRNA vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses and that HHS was moving toward “safer, broader vaccine platforms that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;remain effective even as viruses mutate&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both whole-virus vaccines and mRNA vaccines protected against COVID-19 and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223"&gt;prevented hospitalization and death&lt;/a&gt; for millions of people worldwide between 2020 and 2024, but there’s clear evidence that the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/23510/estimated-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/"&gt;mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt; provided &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac288"&gt;significantly better protection&lt;/a&gt; than whole-virus vaccines. And for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2022.2122582"&gt;are more effective against new variants&lt;/a&gt;, which emerge as viruses mutate, than whole-virus vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;mRNA vaccines’ superpower is that they can be updated and manufactured very quickly, unlike traditional whole-virus vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.2002083"&gt;started with exceptionally high efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, exceeding 94%. When the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/covid-variants-timeline-6741198"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the spring and fall of 2021, mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2023.2167410"&gt;became less effective in preventing infections&lt;/a&gt;. However, they remained &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.4299"&gt;highly effective in preventing severe illness&lt;/a&gt;, whereas in unvaccinated people the rates of severe illness and hospitalization remained high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because mRNA vaccines induce the immune system to make &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.737083"&gt;both antibodies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72619"&gt;specialized immune cells called T cells&lt;/a&gt;. These elements can recognize multiple parts of the virus, including ones that don’t change, enabling significant protection against new variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the mRNA vaccines have a superpower that no other type of vaccine can currently match: They can be &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Production"&gt;quickly updated and manufactured&lt;/a&gt; within two to three months. To develop a whole-virus vaccine, researchers must first &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60412-6/fulltext"&gt;spend months isolating and propagating the virus&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, making an mRNA vaccine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.01.020"&gt;requires just sequencing the virus’s genetic code&lt;/a&gt; – a process that today takes just hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a new pandemic began today, mRNA vaccines are currently the only type of vaccine that could be developed quickly enough to disrupt its spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of mRNA vaccine technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, when scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02483-w"&gt;first started developing mRNA vaccine technology&lt;/a&gt;, they recognized its potential to overcome &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/viiii/infographics/how-does-mrna-vaccine-compare-traditional-vaccine"&gt;major limitations of whole-virus vaccines&lt;/a&gt; – namely, slow production time and more limited ability to protect from new viral variants. Today, mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent or treat diseases including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-mrna-and-dna-vaccines-could-soon-treat-cancers-hiv-autoimmune-disorders-and-genetic-diseases-170772"&gt;HIV and cancer, as well as autoimmune and genetic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2024.115419"&gt;this technology can be further improved&lt;/a&gt;. New mRNA vaccine technologies are aimed, among other things, at making mRNA vaccines easier to store to allow for faster distribution and reduce their short-term side effects, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2025.102595"&gt;eliminate the rare risk of myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2025.102654"&gt;more quickly block a respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health is funneling money away from new mRNA technologies toward a single project &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/hhs-nih-launch-next-generation-universal-vaccine-platform-pandemic-prone-viruses"&gt;developing universal vaccines&lt;/a&gt; based on traditional whole-virus vaccine technology. &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/working-towards-a-universal-influenza-vaccine/"&gt;Universal vaccines are urgently needed&lt;/a&gt; to provide broader protection against ever-changing respiratory viruses, such as influenza, that are major pandemic threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study in mice and ferrets &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167"&gt;showed that a universal flu vaccine NIH plans to support has promise&lt;/a&gt;. However, multiple studies of potential &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm0271"&gt;universal flu vaccines based on mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; show &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12060664"&gt;even more potential&lt;/a&gt;. Such vaccines could induce broader immunity than whole-virus vaccines by eliciting antibody and T-cell responses that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-make-a-universal-flu-vaccine-a-microbiologist-explains-the-challenges-and-how-mrna-could-offer-a-promising-solution-195807"&gt;target an even wider range of flu viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to square those benefits with the fact that HHS and NIH have named the planned new universal vaccine platform “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html"&gt;Generation Gold Standard&lt;/a&gt;,” insisting that it represents a new standard in science and transparency. The effort seems more akin to eliminating all e-bike technology and telling everyone who seeks one to get by with a single brand of a 10-speed bike: Getting to the intended destination may still be possible, but it will be slower and harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the case of abandoning mRNA vaccine research, it may lead to lives needlessly lost, whether due to potential medicines untapped or to pandemic unpreparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

It changes with your activity, stress, and even how hydrated you are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, though, monitoring your heartrate meant using special devices like hospital monitors or smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSC&lt;/a&gt;), have shown that something as common as Wi-Fi can measure this vital sign with surprising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system, called Pulse-Fi, transforms ordinary wireless signals into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-tracking-apple-watch-is-helpful-but-not-always-right/"&gt;health trackers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promises a future where people can monitor their heart health without strapping on devices or relying on costly hospital machinery – all of this can be achieved using Wi-Fi devices that already exist in most homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-wi-fi-the-basics"&gt;Understanding Wi-Fi – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi works by sending information through the air using radio waves, the same type of waves that carry music to your car radio. The difference is that Wi-Fi uses much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024169940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher frequencies&lt;/a&gt;, which lets it carry far more data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside your router, a tiny transmitter turns digital information – like a video or a message – into patterns of radio waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your phone or laptop has an antenna and receiver that catch those waves and turn them back into the pictures, sounds, or words you see on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like tossing a ball back and forth, but instead of a ball, the “catch” is a stream of invisible energy carrying coded information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those radio waves don’t travel forever, though. Walls, floors, and even water in the human body can block or weaken them, which is the basic premise behind Pulse-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-wi-fi-into-pulse-fi"&gt;Turning Wi-Fi into Pulse-Fi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Santa Cruz team included Professor Katia Obraczka, Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia, and visiting high school researcher Pranay Kocheta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they created a low-cost method that pairs Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers with machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9287836/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wi-Fi waves&lt;/a&gt; move through space, bouncing and bending around objects. When those waves encounter the human body, tiny signal shifts occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi’s algorithms analyze those faint disturbances to pick out the rhythm of a heartbeat while filtering out unrelated movements or environmental noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The signal is very sensitive to the environment, so we have to select the right filters to remove all the unnecessary noise,” Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heartbeats-measured-in-seconds"&gt;Heartbeats measured in seconds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 118 participants, and the results were impressive. After only five seconds of analysis, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi measured &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/increased-heart-rate-makes-us-feel-time-passing-faster/"&gt;heartrate&lt;/a&gt; with an error margin of just half a beat per minute. Longer monitoring improved accuracy even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested people in varied body positions – sitting, standing, lying down, and even walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of position, the system worked reliably. Hardware placement in the room also made little difference, proving the system’s adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost components powered the tests. ESP32 chips, which cost under ten dollars, performed well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi devices, though more expensive, achieved even better results. Commercial-grade Wi-Fi hardware could improve performance further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-distance-doesn-t-break-accuracy"&gt;Distance doesn’t break accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another breakthrough was range. Pulse-Fi measured heart rate accurately at distances up to three meters, or nearly ten feet. Additional tests suggest it can perform even farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found was that because of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/machine-learning-could-revolutionize-drug-discovery/"&gt;machine learning model&lt;/a&gt;, that distance apart basically had no effect on performance, which was a very big struggle for past models,” Kocheta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing was position – all the different things you encounter in day to day life, we wanted to make sure we were robust to however a person is living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-pulse-fi-datasets"&gt;Creating Pulse-Fi datasets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train their system, the team needed data. No existing dataset captured heartbeat effects on Wi-Fi signals from ESP32 devices, so they built their own. In the UC Santa Cruz Science and Engineering Library, they carefully set up ESP32 units alongside standard oximeters to generate parallel data streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pairing provided a dependable “ground truth” for training, ensuring that every &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smartwatches-can-now-detect-cardiac-arrest/"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt; recorded through Wi-Fi could be accurately matched with the medically verified heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then trained a neural network to recognize which subtle signal changes represented heartbeats, focusing on even the faintest variations in the wireless data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside their newly built dataset, they validated Pulse-Fi using a large dataset from Brazil collected with Raspberry Pi hardware – one of the most comprehensive Wi-Fi-based health monitoring datasets available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cross-testing confirmed the system’s broad reliability and showed that Pulse-Fi could adapt across device types, room conditions, and participant groups. It demonstrated that a low-cost approach could achieve remarkable accuracy under diverse real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wi-fi-as-health-guardian"&gt;Wi-Fi as health guardian&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi’s creators are not stopping here. They are now adapting the system to detect &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-can-feel-our-emotions-through-our-heart-rate/"&gt;breathing&lt;/a&gt; rates. Early results show strong potential for diagnosing issues like sleep apnea, where subtle breathing patterns are crucial for detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a capability could give doctors new insights into sleep quality, respiratory problems, and long-term health risks – without the need for intrusive overnight monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining affordability, accuracy, and non-intrusiveness, Pulse-Fi points to a future where everyday Wi-Fi doubles as a quiet guardian of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart homes could eventually integrate the system, providing continuous tracking of both heart and lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advancement would make preventive care more accessible, offering people the chance to detect health issues early and share reliable data with clinicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once required specialized devices might soon be handled by the invisible signals already surrounding us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IEEE Xplore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:35:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQMWFzcnMtX0YtaUJHaTBXdWxJZlJmWmhHM0NwTjRwbGtaRnZBNkNrLVJ1NmJ4MEs4UGZ1cTRMeld2WENmeDNKN1dsWkVsbU5WNVRrdDFpN2xxX2s5NVVBU00ycmVFTVhoUTNpLUxUa0g0RTUzanFSa0lyMVNrX3E0a0lHV213ZWh5SlNOa1BPaXZ0bmVuNVVmN1hWVE9NdkRlQ2c</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪将为疫苗咨询小组增加新成员--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/health/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-members.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:32:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFA1OUtqdExkZ0xIS1QxbGZwNFNBYU4yTEVDSmNmN0JRWWhmUTNoV0hwODFCdEVQX3hoYjVGbGhYaU13UUdFdnJpSEFiLTdmTG1WWnNZOVF1V2NFZ3ZOMkZZSVpVWElaX0dESExfZVhxSjhWZjU4VE92dy0yQ0dHakk</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪准备任命新的疫苗小组成员-Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/03/kennedy-prepares-to-name-new-acip-members-00542750</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:32:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPRmEySlA1V0k5a2hXX1lEdEVpdnd0Rmg0ZVBxc0x5ekVJX0FjWmZucW41Q19Rb0g5Y25kSTV2Y19pLVFHckZGMGl2Z3M0Z0h1SFc4dTh1S0Z4aWVFQ25PT3QyZ2JjSnBFbXFsOFlITGh2Y2czcVlNQU1sUFNPVHUtTFExTlhwZHRieTVWdVB5ZEpHRjhhVmc</guid></item><item><title>数据显示，德克萨斯州中部的新冠肺炎病例“非常高” - MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/covid-texas-21029042.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

One population that especially needs to be mindful of their vaccination status is older adults. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When I treat older patients, I like to stress that a proactive vaccination schedule is critical for preventing serious illnesses,” says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-vercammen-grandjean-099aa1211/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Chris Vercammen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Chris Vercammen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a general internist with a special focus in geriatrics and palliative care, and the medical director at &lt;a href="https://remo.health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Remo Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Remo Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, he and another doctor share all the vaccines to check about when you go to the doctor’s office or pharmacist within the next month or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 6 Most Important Vaccines To Get Right Now if You're Over 60, According to Doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. The flu vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the “number one most important vaccine” for everyone over six months or older, and “especially for people over 50,” according to&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/departments/family-medicine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Grant Fowler, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Grant Fowler, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the chair of family medicine at Burnett School of Medicine at TCU and an expert in geriatric medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu is always a concern, but it is even more so now. Last year, Dr. Fowler says, fewer people got the vaccination, and about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-19.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27,000 people died;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;27,000 people died&lt;/a&gt;. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of the deaths were people 65 and older,” he adds. “This was a lower vaccination rate than prior years; it dropped to below pre-pandemic vaccination levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vercammen agrees that the flu vaccine is paramount. “Older adults are at a significantly higher risk for severe complications from the flu,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends getting this vaccination every year, ideally by the end of October. “For my patients over 65, I typically advise either a high-dose or an adjuvanted flu vaccine, as those are specifically formulated to create a stronger immune response,” Dr. Vercammen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/top-vaccine-myth-to-stop-believing-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I’m an Infectious Disease Expert, and This Is the #1 Vaccine Myth I Wish Everyone Would Stop Believing’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I’m an Infectious Disease Expert, and This Is the #1 Vaccine Myth I Wish Everyone Would Stop Believing’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. The COVID vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptom-june-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID is still among us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID is still among us&lt;/a&gt;, though thankfully not to the same extent. Getting this vaccine again is important, too, especially since &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818660" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID may be more deadly than the flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID may be more deadly than the flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To protect against severe disease onset and symptoms, hospitalization and other long-term complications in older patients, I encourage people to stay up-to-date with the latest recommended COVID-19 vaccine,” Dr. Vercammen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After age 65, the CDC is recommending two doses of updated COVID vaccines six months apart, especially in those with risk factors,” Dr. Fowler adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. The TDAP vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You only need to get this vaccine (or its booster) once every 10 years; it doesn’t require a yearly dosage. It protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw a little uptick in pertussis (&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/unexpected-whooping-cough-symptoms-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whooping cough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;) cases this year and last year,” Dr. Fowler says. “This [vaccine] protects not only the elderly, but especially young children (younger than three months) if the elderly are around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. The RSV vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is relatively new and is recommended for people over the age of 75, or over the age of 50 with risk factors, such as COPD, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1264365/shelby-deering/asthma-symptoms-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:asthma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease on dialysis, diabetes with complications, severe liver disease, severe obesity or those who live in a nursing home, according to Dr. Fowler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RSV is a condition that can cause severe respiratory illness, Dr. Vercammen says, especially in older adults with underlying conditions. He recommends considering the vaccine as early as 60 years old, saying your healthcare provider can help you nail the exact timing after assessing your risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/signs-of-rsv-in-older-adults-according-to-immunologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Top Symptoms of RSV To Be Aware of in Older Adults, According to Immunologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Top Symptoms of RSV To Be Aware of in Older Adults, According to Immunologists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Pneumococcal vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vercammen strongly recommends this for people who are 65 years old or older, noting it can protect against life-threatening conditions. “These vaccines protect against diseases caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can include pneumonia, meningitis and bloodstream infections,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. The Shingles vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-vaccine-dementia-risk-study-march-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is called Shingrix. It’s important for people over 50 years old. “Shingles can be an extremely painful condition,” warns Dr. Vercammen. “Shingrix, which is administered as a two-dose series, is highly effective at preventing the virus and its complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already gotten those two doses, you’re good to go. Otherwise, check with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-vaccine-dementia-risk-study-march-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Common Vaccine May Lower Your Dementia Risk by 20%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Common Vaccine May Lower Your Dementia Risk by 20%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Important Health Practices To Follow This Season if You’re Over 60&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abiding by the usual health-and-safety precautions is also important, both for avoiding disease and for your health more generally.

							&lt;p data-start="398" data-end="588"&gt;We live in a time where wellness has become a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="398" data-end="588"&gt;People love to talk about their morning routines, their special diets, their productivity hacks—all in the name of “health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="590" data-end="818"&gt;But here’s the catch: not everything that gets paraded around as healthy actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="590" data-end="818"&gt;Some habits people brag about are quietly draining their energy, messing with their mental health, or even putting stress on their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="820" data-end="1020"&gt;I’ve noticed this pattern over the years: the more someone insists they’ve “hacked” their way to peak wellness, the more likely it is that at least one part of their routine is working against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1022" data-end="1068"&gt;Let’s dig into seven of those sneaky habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1075" data-end="1112"&gt;1. Waking up at 4 a.m. every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1114" data-end="1263"&gt;You’ve probably heard someone brag about how they wake up before the sun, crush a workout, journal, meditate, and still answer emails before 7 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1265" data-end="1400"&gt;Sounds impressive, right? Except… if you’re not getting enough sleep, the “early riser” routine is hurting you more than helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1402" data-end="1638"&gt;Sleep deprivation impairs memory, increases stress hormones, and over time, can lead to burnout. The National Sleep Foundation notes that adults need &lt;a href="https://www.thensf.org/sleep-facts-and-statistics/?.com"&gt;7–9 hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt;, yet many people sacrificing sleep for productivity get far less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1640" data-end="1904"&gt;I once tried joining the “4 a.m. club.” For the first week, I felt like I was winning at life. By week two, I was cranky, scattered, and reaching for more caffeine just to function. The productivity I thought I was gaining was canceled out by constant brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1906" data-end="2115"&gt;The bragging point shouldn’t be how early you get up—it should be how well you’re supporting your body’s natural rhythms. If you’re a night owl, forcing a 4 a.m. wake-up might just leave you feeling wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2122" data-end="2162"&gt;2. Intermittent fasting to extremes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2164" data-end="2272"&gt;Fasting can have benefits. That’s true. But what often gets overlooked is how many people take it too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2274" data-end="2429"&gt;I once knew someone who bragged about only eating one meal a day. Sure, they lost weight, but they were constantly irritable, low-energy, and often sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2431" data-end="2582"&gt;The body needs consistent nourishment. Skipping meals to the point where you feel lightheaded or anxious isn’t discipline—it’s stress on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2584" data-end="2739"&gt;As nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert has said, “There’s a difference between mindful fasting and restrictive eating patterns that damage both body and mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2741" data-end="3076"&gt;Here’s the bigger issue: when fasting turns into a competition, it starts to look a lot like disordered eating. If you’re bragging about how long you can go without food, you’re missing the point of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2741" data-end="3076"&gt;Balance is key. Eating at regular intervals that match your energy needs will serve you better than any extreme eating window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3083" data-end="3130"&gt;3. Pushing through workouts when exhausted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3132" data-end="3271"&gt;There’s this “no excuses” culture around fitness, where people brag about never missing a workout, even when sick or completely depleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3273" data-end="3389"&gt;But exercise is a stressor. It can build resilience when you’re healthy—but when you’re run-down, it can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3391" data-end="3617"&gt;I fell into this trap during marathon training. One winter, I caught the flu and still went for a “short” run because I didn’t want to mess up my schedule. The result? A two-week setback that undid all the progress I’d made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3619" data-end="3820"&gt;Listening to your body isn’t laziness. It’s wisdom. Rest days are where the actual growth and repair happen. Skipping a workout when your body truly needs it doesn’t make you weak—it makes you smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3827" data-end="3857"&gt;4. Living on black coffee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3859" data-end="3999"&gt;Some people proudly announce they “run on caffeine.” They skip breakfast, load up on coffee, and treat jittery energy as a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4001" data-end="4154"&gt;But caffeine isn’t fuel—it’s a stimulant. Too much can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep cycles, and even deplete magnesium levels, which worsens stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4156" data-end="4304"&gt;Experts at the Sleep Foundation have noted that &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/caffeine-and-sleep?.com"&gt;consuming caffeine too frequently&lt;/a&gt; can trick your body into masking fatigue rather than solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4306" data-end="4598"&gt;I’ve been guilty of this too. In my finance days, I’d brag about how many cups of coffee I could down before noon. But the truth was, I was constantly wired and exhausted at the same time. I didn’t need more caffeine—I needed more rest, better food, and clearer boundaries with my workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4735"&gt;Coffee in moderation? Great. But bragging about surviving on coffee alone? That’s a recipe for adrenal fatigue and emotional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4742" data-end="4767"&gt;5. Always being “on”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4769" data-end="4945"&gt;This one often hides under the label of “productivity.” People brag about answering emails late at night, being on call 24/7, or skipping breaks because they’re so dedicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4947" data-end="5149"&gt;But our brains aren’t designed for nonstop output. Research from Stanford shows that productivity sharply &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/escaping-the-infinite-workday-trap-11773137?.com"&gt;declines after 50 hours of work&lt;/a&gt; in a week—and longer hours lead to errors, not better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5151" data-end="5422"&gt;I used to think working through lunch made me efficient. In reality, it just made me more likely to hit an afternoon slump. When I started taking short breaks—a walk outside, a quick stretch, even five minutes of silence—I noticed my energy and focus actually improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5424" data-end="5530"&gt;The healthiest people aren’t the ones glued to their laptops—they’re the ones who know how to step away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5537" data-end="5563"&gt;6. Over-supplementing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5565" data-end="5726"&gt;Some people take a dozen different pills every morning and proudly line them up like trophies. Vitamins, powders, “biohacking” formulas—it can look impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5728" data-end="5892"&gt;But here’s the truth: more isn’t always better. Over-supplementing can tax your liver and kidneys, throw off nutrient balance, and in some cases, even cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5894" data-end="6018"&gt;For example, too much vitamin D can lead to calcium buildup. Excess iron can cause organ damage. These aren’t small risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6020" data-end="6166"&gt;Supplements should fill in gaps, not replace a balanced diet. As dietitian Abby Langer puts it, “Supplements should supplement, not substitute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6168" data-end="6478"&gt;I learned this the hard way in my early wellness days. I bought into every trending powder and capsule I saw on Instagram. But after a round of blood work, my doctor told me some of my levels were actually too high. All that money and effort hadn’t made me healthier—it had just made things more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6480" data-end="6619"&gt;If you’re bragging about how many capsules you swallow daily, it might be worth rethinking whether that’s health—or just expensive urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6626" data-end="6652"&gt;7. Forcing positivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6654" data-end="6866"&gt;This one’s a little different, but it shows up a lot in wellness spaces. People brag about how they “never let anything get them down,” how they’re always upbeat, always grateful, always manifesting good vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6868" data-end="6926"&gt;But constant positivity isn’t resilience—it’s avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6928" data-end="7151"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/toxic-positivity?.com"&gt;Toxic positivity&lt;/a&gt;, as psychologists call it, can actually shut down real emotional processing. When you force yourself to only see the bright side, you ignore the necessary work of feeling, grieving, or setting boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7153" data-end="7333"&gt;I’ve seen friends push away their own pain in the name of being “spiritual” or “high vibe.” Eventually, it catches up with them in the form of burnout, anxiety, or disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7335" data-end="7592"&gt;True wellness isn’t about never having negative emotions. It’s about holding space for the full spectrum of being human. Some of the healthiest conversations I’ve ever had started with the words, “I’m not okay right now.” That’s not weakness—it’s honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7599" data-end="7618"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7620" data-end="7723"&gt;The funny thing is, the wellness habits people brag about are often the ones quietly sabotaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7725" data-end="7912"&gt;Health isn’t about extremes, rigid rules, or being the most disciplined person in the room. It’s about balance, sustainability, and actually feeling good—not just looking good on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7914" data-end="8134"&gt;So the next time you hear someone bragging about their 4 a.m. wake-ups, their one-meal-a-day routine, or their endless hustle, pause and ask yourself: does this actually sound healthy, or does it just sound exhausting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8136" data-end="8231"&gt;Your body—and your mind—will thank you for choosing the quieter, gentler version of wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most people think of zinc, they picture a vitamin supplement that helps fight off colds. But researchers in Europe have uncovered a surprising new role for this essential mineral — one that could transform farming as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from Denmark's Aarhus University, the Polytechnic University of Madrid, and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/greener-and-cheaper-how-zinc-could-change-farming-forever/" target="_blank"&gt;discovered that zinc&lt;/a&gt; isn't just good for people. It also helps legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils make better use of nitrogen. These plants already have a natural ability to "fix" nitrogen from the air, but zinc boosts that process, helping them feed themselves more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients in agriculture — and right now, farms rely heavily on chemical fertilizers to supply it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Globally, farmers use over &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-fertilizer" target="_blank"&gt;100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer every year&lt;/a&gt;, and producing it requires vast amounts of energy. On top of that, excess fertilizer often washes into rivers and oceans, fueling algal blooms that choke out fish and threaten drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f15eb604a5101b64cfbabbaced6615c6 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-f15eb604a5101b64cfbabbaced6615c6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-60b0f46103c3ba9b088136f845f71548 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-60b0f46103c3ba9b088136f845f71548"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-828f9a021edcdd7708ab429d1e09bb84 theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-828f9a021edcdd7708ab429d1e09bb84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-86d03deb4f57d273a6e9ded4abe508cd theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-86d03deb4f57d273a6e9ded4abe508cd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-9437d227aa877da76ab61a4a88c013dd theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-9437d227aa877da76ab61a4a88c013dd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-5e162b6b70b8cf1219e9f889ad3ab205 theco-programmatic-ev-ira-widget" id="theco-5e162b6b70b8cf1219e9f889ad3ab205"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-d337016a66c6a3a025da823343ef9da6 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-d337016a66c6a3a025da823343ef9da6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-aa719ce6a80111bd01a0d1f09e1cb2c8 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-aa719ce6a80111bd01a0d1f09e1cb2c8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been searching for decades for ways to make crops less dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/organic-fertilizers-benefits-gardening/" target="_blank"&gt;synthetic fertilizers&lt;/a&gt;. Legumes have always stood out as special because of their natural nitrogen-fixing abilities, but until now, researchers didn't fully understand how that process was regulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7081189975bd4d5f2fb3434ee42ff757 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-7081189975bd4d5f2fb3434ee42ff757"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough came when the team identified a regulatory protein called "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240626152152.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Fixation Under Nitrate&lt;/a&gt;." Together with zinc, this protein helps legumes fine-tune their nitrogen use, essentially making them better at feeding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-4220734234" data-theco-trackid="479537" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-383a516ce89d555dfe4afed93bacccb3 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-383a516ce89d555dfe4afed93bacccb3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's truly remarkable to discover zinc's role as a secondary signal in plants," &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/greener-and-cheaper-how-zinc-could-change-farming-forever/" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; assistant professor Jieshun Lin, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery could have ripple effects across the global food system. Legumes are a cornerstone of diets worldwide, and making them more self-sufficient could mean healthier soils, lower farming costs, and cleaner waterways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e512267729db74b620f17ac9a36e143f theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-e512267729db74b620f17ac9a36e143f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-6955da6b012bcea9b96d327d63447f31 theco-palmetto-2-solar-widget" id="theco-6955da6b012bcea9b96d327d63447f31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For everyday consumers, that translates to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/organic-valley-cooperative-farms-expand-growth/" target="_blank"&gt;food grown with less chemicals&lt;/a&gt; — a win for both human health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it may take several years before this research reaches farm fields, the potential is clear. A simple mineral we already rely on for health may soon help crops thrive naturally, cutting pollution at the source and supporting a &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/grow-your-own-food/" target="_blank"&gt;greener future for farming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-10th-p-carousel theco-target" id="theco-1295906671" data-theco-trackid="446882" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

But the flood of sleep advice can feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From supplement recommendations to cutting caffeine at a certain hour, avoiding screens before bed, and timing your meals perfectly, the pressure to "do everything right" can backfire. In fact, it can lead to orthosomnia—anxiety about getting perfect sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep therapist Kirsty Vant &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-pieces-of-sleep-advice-that-could-be-making-your-insomnia-worse-a-sleep-therapist-explains-261682" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shared;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; five common sleep tips that might actually be making your insomnia worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/exercise-scientist-reveals-one-subtle-191700750.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Exercise Scientist Reveals the One Subtle Bedroom Change That Transforms Sleep Quality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Exercise Scientist Reveals the One Subtle Bedroom Change That Transforms Sleep Quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Advice That Ruins Your Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Spend More Time in Bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It might seem logical to spend extra time in bed if you’re struggling to sleep, but it’s actually better to limit your time there. Try going to bed slightly later while keeping a consistent wake-up time each morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The more time you spend in bed awake, the more you weaken the mental association between bed and sleep—and strengthen the link between bed and frustration," Vant says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Avoid Screens Completely&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If falling asleep at night is a struggle, you might reach for your phone to scroll mindlessly, which goes against much of the sleep advice we hear. But cutting out your phone entirely and lying in the dark with nothing to focus on can spark anxiety and overthinking, which are both major triggers for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"A quiet podcast or gentle documentary can be just the right distraction to help you relax," Vant advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Cut Caffeine Cold Turkey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Everyone reacts to caffeine differently, so you don’t have to give up your beloved morning coffee. Just pay attention to how your body responds and set your caffeine cutoff time based on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If you’re sensitive to caffeine, it’s wise to avoid it later in the day—but cutting it out altogether isn’t always necessary. Understanding your individual response is key," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Obsess Over Sleep Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you use wearable tech like an Oura Ring or Garmin to track your sleep, you know how easy it is to start obsessing over every night’s numbers. That kind of stress isn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While we can influence sleep through healthy habits, we can’t force it to happen. Becoming obsessed with sleep quality can paradoxically make it worse," Vant says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Expect the Same Amount of Sleep Every Day&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can do your best to stick to a a solid sleep routine, but don’t expect a perfect eight hours every night. Some nights will be great, others not so much. Life circumstances have a way of affecting nightly sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Expecting rigid consistency from your sleep sets up unrealistic expectations," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/study-reveals-most-impactful-exercise-183039170.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Study Reveals the Most Impactful Exercise for Fighting Sleep Disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Study Reveals the Most Impactful Exercise for Fighting Sleep Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://www.mensfitness.com/news/sleep-therapist-reveals-the-5-popular-tips-that-can-actually-destroy-your-sleep" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Men's Fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Men's Fitness&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 3, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://www.mensfitness.com/news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; section.

A large, long-term study has found a link between consuming low- and no-calorie sweeteners and cognitive decline, especially in people under 60 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-912801" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" target="_blank"&gt;first-of-its-kind study&lt;/a&gt; adds to the body of research suggesting that artificial sweeteners may come with health consequences — but they also have some benefits, such as being lower in calories, reducing risk of cavities and aiding in blood sugar management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2190a" class="body-graf"&gt;So what does the new research mean if you regularly consume artificial sweeteners? Here's what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-023ae1" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Sweeteners Were Linked to Cognitive Decline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-899ced" class="body-graf"&gt;The study followed over 12,000 middle-aged Brazilian adults for eight years, measuring their dietary intake of seven common sweeteners using self-reporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-c3e8d6" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspartame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saccharin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acesulfame-K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erythritol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorbitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xylitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tagatose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51279b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We used the sweeteners that were available in Brazil at the time (of enrollment),” Dr. Claudia Suemoto, associate professor of geriatrics at the University of Sao Paulo and one of the study authors, tells TODAY.com via email. “Unfortunately, some sweeteners, like sucralose and stevia, were not available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d98be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers found that higher intake of the seven sweeteners was significantly associated with declines in global cognition and verbal fluency based on several different cognitive tests. The results were similar among all participants, but the link between low- and no-calorie sweeteners and memory decline was strongest in people with diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06c3f0" class="body-graf"&gt;Interestingly, the impact was greater in adults under 60 years old, while no significant associations were seen in those over 60. That suggests dietary habits in midlife, decades before dementia symptoms may appear, could have lifelong consequences for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca4043" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is important to remember that cognitive performance peaks around the third decade of life, between 25 and 30 years old, and after that there is a very slow, gradual decline in function. What our study shows is that sweetener consumption may accelerate this natural process, even in middle-aged adults,” says Suemoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-843f76" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers suspect that artificial sweeteners may influence the brain through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration or disruption of the gut–brain axis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13c235" class="body-graf"&gt;“Animal studies, for example, suggest that aspartame can trigger inflammation in the brain, while sugar alcohols like erythritol and sorbitol may alter gut microbes and compromise the blood–brain barrier,” says Suemoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a10fe" class="body-graf"&gt;However, these studies use very large doses of sweeteners, beyond what most people consume in a day. So while the results probably do not translate to the smaller doses in beverages and other foods, "more research is needed both in animal models and mostly in humans," Suemoto explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2689c7" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should You Avoid Artificial Sweeteners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f6ef19" class="body-graf"&gt;While this is the first large cohort study to demonstrate an association between artificial sweeteners and cognitive decline, Suemoto emphasizes that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63f7ad" class="body-graf"&gt;For example, other studies could look at objective measurements of how much artificial sweetener participants were exposed to and images of the brain to see which parts may be most affected, she adds. Another approach would be to conduct a randomized study where participants either reduce or completely replace artificial sweeteners in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6ea39" class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're looking for guidance based the data currently available, Suemoto says moderation is key: “It is wise to limit consumption as much as possible, ideally avoiding daily use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9f8b3" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration (FDA)&lt;/a&gt; has deemed these types of sweeteners safe for human consumption, based on the "available scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a76097" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Foods Most Often Contain These Sweeteners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c64419" class="body-graf"&gt;Artificial sweeteners are found in a wide range of processed foods and beverages, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-c9e384" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet sodas and “sugar-free” beverages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sugar-free gum and mints&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Packaged protein bars and shakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-calorie desserts, candies and ice creams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flavored yogurts and puddings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Light” salad dressings, sauces and condiments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8d704a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy Eating Habits to Prevent Cognitive Decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc5b24" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-024-00150-8" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt;

Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘No place in children’s hands’: under-16s in England to be banned from buying energy drinks","elementId":"0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;Sept. 2 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; People who consume the highest levels of artificial sweeteners during middle age show the fastest declines in cognitive functions, such as memory, as they move into their senior years, according to a study released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of nearly 13,000 middle-aged Brazilian adults who were followed for an average of eight years revealed that those who consumed the most aspartame, saccharin and five other kinds of sweeteners experienced cognitive declines at a 62% faster clip than those who consumed the lowest amounts, the researchers said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That difference equates to about 1.6 years of aging, according to the study &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/journal/wnl" target="_blank"&gt;published in the journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link between sweeteners and the rapidity of decline was even stronger in people with diabetes, particularly for memory loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there appeared to be no effect in participants aged 60 and older. This suggests exposure to artificial sweeteners during midlife -- when many people turn to them to lose weight -- may carry lifelong consequences for brain health, according to the researchers from the University of Sao Paulo and elsewhere in Brazil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven artificial sweeteners studied were aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame k, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol and tagatose. Daily consumption of any or all them in midlife was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition in later years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, had some limitations, including that the diet information used was reported by the participants themselves, and they may not have remembered accurately everything they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It builds on &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2799140" target="_blank"&gt;earlier work&lt;/a&gt; by the Brazilian researchers connecting ultra-processed foods with faster cognitive decline. Many such foods marketed as sugar-free contain artificial sweeteners, noted co-author Claudia Kimie Suemoto, an associate professor of geriatrics at the University of Sao Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By following more than 12,000 adults for eight years, our study adds robust evidence that these compounds may not be harmless, particularly when consumed frequently and starting in midlife," she told UPI in emailed comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the broader scientific context, our findings highlight the need to look more critically at what we are using to replace sugar in our diets, and they underscore that dietary choices in midlife can have consequences for brain health decades later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suemoto said her study is the largest and longest prospective study to date investigating the association between artificial sweetener consumption and cognitive decline, adding that the few studies published on the topic previously had smaller samples and followed participants for shorter periods of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, while previous research had linked sweeteners to conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and depression, their long-term impact on cognition had not been systematically explored," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising findings, she said, was that the association between low- and no-calorie sweetener consumption and cognitive decline was only significant among participants younger than 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had expected the association to be more evident in older adults, since they are at higher risk of dementia and cognitive impairment," Suemoto said. "Instead, our results suggest that midlife exposure to sweeteners may be particularly harmful, which is important because midlife is a critical period for setting the trajectory of brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline and dementia are thought to begin developing decades before symptoms become noticeable, so exposures during midlife may accelerate these processes and have long-term consequences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is a new understanding of the importance of getting a handle on dietary habits earlier in adulthood, "when preventive strategies could have the greatest impact," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian findings intertwine with what already was suspected about the negative effects of low-calorie sweeteners on brain health, said Pradeep Bhide, the Jim and Betty Ann Rodgers Eminent Scholar Chair of Developmental Neuroscience at Florida State University and director of FSU's Institute for Pediatric Rare Diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told UPI the results "echo" his findings from &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2799140" target="_blank"&gt;a 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on aspartame, in which he found that daily consumption in mice can lead to behavioral and cognitive impairments, such as anxiety-like behavior, learning deficits and memory impairment, likely due to the sweetener's effects on the brain's neurotransmitter systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, our own experimental studies also demonstrated that these effects were not limited to the exposed individuals, but were transmitted from aspartame-exposed fathers to their offspring across two generations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Brazilian study's limitations, its combination of large-scale human data and controlled laboratory findings "strengthens the concern that chronic exposure to artificial sweeteners may have significant neurobehavioral consequences," Bhide said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results underscore the need for caution in the widespread use of such sweeteners and highlight the importance of further mechanistic studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theresa Gentile, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said the study highlights a possible "worsening" of risk for those with diabetes and cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many people choose sugar-free or 'diet' products thinking they're the healthier option, but this research suggests that they might not be the best choice for brain health," she told UPI. "Overall, the study highlights that being careful with sweetener choices could help protect both blood vessel health and memory."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study reinforces earlier evidence linking sweeteners to health risks like and "adds weight by showing that many of the same sweeteners may also harm brain health over the long term," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also "supports the gut-brain connection, since changes in gut bacteria and inflammation are possible ways these sweeteners could affect memory and thinking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the study demonstrated that not every sweetener is the same regarding cognition. Tagatose, sold as a lower-calorie alternative to sucrose, "stood out as not being linked to cognitive decline, which suggests some natural sweeteners may be better options for cognition than others," Gentile added.&lt;/p&gt;

The average age of participants was 33, and 66% were women.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the trial, all participants, healthy adults from 18 to 65, showed no signs of an acute infection, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three times as many people in the control group contracted COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period 2.2% (5) of the participants in the azelastine group became infected with SARS-CoV-2 as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but in the placebo group, it was 6.7% (15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That translates to a 69% lower rate of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.31; 85% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.87).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who did get COVID-19 infections, azelastine demonstrated an increase in mean time to infection (31.2 days vs 19.5 days in the placebo group), and a reduction of the overall number of PCR-confirmed symptomatic infections (21 of treated 227 participants compared to 49 of 223 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azelastine also significantly reduced rhinovirus infections in the treatment group. During the 56-day follow up, 1.8% developed a rhinovirus infection in the treatment group, compared to 6.3% in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse events were comparable in the two groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that azelastine may provide meaningful protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a prophylactic setting," the authors wrote. "Data on the safety and effectiveness of 2 sprays of azelastine, 0.1%, nasal spray per nostril twice daily for the treatment of moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis as well as the existence of azelastine, 0.15%, nasal spray formulations on the market support the safe use of this medicinal product for longer periods of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intervention targeting the nasal mucosa could prove particularly beneficial in settings where multiple respiratory viruses are cocirculating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2838339"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a commentary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the study in the same journal, Samuel Vidal, MD, PhD, and Dan Barouch, MD, PhD, both from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said the study was promising, but the drug needs more testing among adults with comorbidities. But in the face of ever-changing variants, and vaccines that target the changing virus spike proteins, targeting the nasal mucosa may be a way forward in combating COVID-19 during the cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This intervention targeting the nasal mucosa could prove particularly beneficial in settings where multiple respiratory viruses are cocirculating or if the pathogens are unknown," the two wrote. "Should the present data be confirmed in larger phase 3 efficacy trials, intranasal azelastine may have substantial clinical utility, given its ease of administration, low cost, and over-the-counter availability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Understanding these links could help inform more tailored approaches to maintaining brain health after menopause,” study author Liisa A.M. Galea, PhD, of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was &lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213995" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published online&lt;/a&gt; on August 27 in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivery Method Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data on 7251 cognitively healthy participants (mean age at baseline, 60.5 years) enrolled in the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging. The average age at menopause onset was 51 years. Overall, 4% used transdermal E2 therapy, 2% took the pill form, and the remaining 94% never took hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women taking only E2 or E2 and progesterone/progestin were included in the E2 group. Transdermal delivery included gels and vaginal MHT. Investigators controlled for age, years of education, and vascular risk to account for significant differences among the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier onset of menopause was significantly associated with reduced episodic memory, reduced prospective memory, and reduced executive function (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001 for all). The association with reduced executive function was significantly stronger in carriers of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; e4 allele than in noncarriers (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .011) and individuals with four or more children (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher scores for episodic memory, such as recalling past events, were observed among women taking transdermal E2 than among those who never used MHT (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculated that this formulation, unlike oral E2, bypasses first-pass hepatic metabolism and leads to higher, more stable concentrations of E2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher scores for prospective memory, such as remembering an appointment or to take a medication, were observed among women taking oral E2 than among those who never took MHT (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .015). The authors hypothesized that a lower dose of E2 could be necessary to improve prospective memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we cannot say hormone therapy causes these effects, it adds to the conversation about how best to support brain health after menopause,” Galea said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort primarily had White individuals with higher incomes, and the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. In addition, the study data did not allow analysis of how hormone therapy dosage, duration, or timing might influence cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question about the potential cognitive benefit of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the subject of long-standing debate, Eva Hogervorst, PhD, professor of psychology, School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, England, noted in an &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214153" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s findings about the type of E2 administration are important, “The small numbers of MHT users should perhaps caution overinterpretation of these diﬀerential results,” Hogervorst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings stand in contrast to longer-term randomized controlled trials like the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study and the Early vs Late Intervention Trial, Hogervorst pointed out. In these trials, no significant effect of MHT on cognition was observed up to 4 or 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the current study included only healthy women. How the therapy might influence cognition for women in poor health, women who underwent early or premature (surgical) menopause, or women of different ethnicities, remains unclear, Hogervorst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study was independently supported. The authors of the study and the editorial reported having no relevant financial relationships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPWTRseWRydXNPN2taUldxY0VVT2tvUnRwYnRuUDJzTzNscUpUVU1YaF9uczNsc0JlLUxhYkpNWlozbnhUcno4RlM0ZDIyRlA5cDFNQzlFbXhPN2N0dTFBMWRlcmxTZndBTnZSZkxWUjQ1bWV0NzVjTURGVnU2S2xDQ2F4OUlEVHRic25PSnRZVTNZSTdBMHJNNE1RTUZ1ZHE0MkFJenRmMk5Mdw</guid></item><item><title>8例西尼罗河病毒人类病例— 1例死亡—在犹他州戴维斯县检测到- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51369657/8-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus--1-death--detected-in-utah-davis-counties</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROVO — Two county health departments in Utah are reporting more human cases of West Nile virus on Wednesday, including one that led to the death of a Davis County resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department said it has seen three reported cases of West Nile virus with two of those cases being neuroinvasive West Nile virus, a more severe form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of the Davis County individuals who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile virus were hospitalized, with one dying from the disease. No other information was provided about the person who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Utah County Health Department confirmed five cases of West Nile virus in humans in the county. Of those five cases, four are neuroinvasive West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between the high number of positive mosquito pools and multiple human cases with symptoms, it is clear that West Nile virus is actively being detected across Utah County," said a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest cases come on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51361247" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;three other human cases&lt;/a&gt; of West Nile virus reported in Salt Lake and Cache counties in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Utah County Mosquito Abatement crews are conducting additional assessments and have begun applying "targeted treatments" in neighborhoods where the five cases were identified, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These enhanced efforts are intended to reduce mosquito populations and lower the risk of transmission," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department states that individuals over 60 and those with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness from West Nile, but anyone can contract the illness from the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent contracting West Nile, the Utah County Health Department advises people to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always use insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves, pants and socks at dawn and dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate standing water around the home, as mosquitoes can breed in just a few days in small containers, buckets, bird baths, flowerpots or clogged gutters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep doors and windows screened and repair any holes or tears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take extra caution if you are older or immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Two of those cases were neuroinvasive and the patients were hospitalized. One of those hospitalized passed away due to the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people who have been infected with West Nile Virus don't develop any symptoms, but it can cause mild to severe illness in some people," said Davis County Health Department spokesperson Trevor Warner in a media release. "It is estimated that less than 1% of people infected with West Nile Virus develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can result in debilitating long-term complications or death." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RELATED | Mosquito Infections in Utah:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said symptoms of a West Nile Virus infection typically appear within two to 14 days of a mosquito bite. Symptoms may include fever, headaches or body aches. More severe infections may include high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals over the age of 60 or people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness due to West Nile Virus, but Warner said anyone can become ill from the bite of an infected mosquito. It is currently unclear the age or condition of the individual who passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health has reported that as of Aug. 30, 2025, Utah has seen 16 reported cases of West Nile Virus. Of those 16, 13 developed into a neuroinvasive form of the virus and only the one patient in Davis County has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department urged anyone who believes they may have a West Nile Virus infection to contact their healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utahns are also encouraged to protect themselves from mosquito bites and infection by using mosquito repellent, wearing light-colored and loose-fitting long sleeves and pants after dusk, and, when possible, avoid prolonged outdoor activity at dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utahns can prevent bites by draining standing water in yards, keeping gutters clear of debris, and keep weeds and tall grass cut short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KMYU</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:04:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOR0JFcmI2cERIOV9pVXlfcnE0Ym91RTJoZGJteG9RSnhvNkY4ekRfOEhvTWQzbmNIUWFtY0RMRE52alRIc21tSnhsZ0tLOG4xVHVLZWpXb3p5dTBvUVktQm11NzJ5TWJoRFBzb1h6MlJlUlNlNzJtSHE1bDktMEk5UlhpQUVEVkxua2RneXplUlBXV2dWTW5iVW1xM2xLMVFmRGRQSGdLNTQ5Y3lIcHVJTGZyMm9LcTg</guid></item><item><title>现在，即使是狗也被告知要去素食主义者！兽医声称，植物性食品为猪提供与肉类饮食“相似的营养素” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15060639/DOGS-vegan-Plant-foods-nutrients-meat.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're usually found begging for a sausage or a bit of chicken from your dinner plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But giving your dog a chunk of meat – or even a bone to chew on – might soon be a thing of the past, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have discovered that &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-897d1f80-88a7-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; options for dogs sold in the UK provide similar nutrition to meat–based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they argue that plant–based meals can be a 'healthy and viable' alternative for our four–legged friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study found that plant–based diets, when properly formulated, can be a healthy and viable alternative to meat–based options', lead author Rebecca Brociek, from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nottingham/index.html" id="mol-897fb790-88a7-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;'s School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ideally the next step is long–term feeding studies, but as we begin to rethink pet nutrition, perhaps the alternative isn't only better for the planet, but also beneficial for our four–legged companions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As plant–based diets gain popularity in human nutrition, the pet food industry is following suit with vegan diets becoming increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could mean that instead of eating food made from chicken, lamb and beef, more dogs will soon be given meals consisting of sweet potato, carrot flakes and pea protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said that plant–based diets can be a reasonable alternative to traditional meat options (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs, like humans, are omnivores and require certain nutrients rather than specific ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the team analysed the nutritional profiles of 31 meat and plant–based dog foods available in the UK. This included the levels of proteins, individual amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and all B–vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, they found that plant–based diets, when properly formulated, can be a reasonable alternative to meat–based options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional composition of meat and plant–based foods for dogs were similar, except for iodine and B–vitamins, which were lower in plant–based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said adopting a vegan diet for canine companions can provide adequate nutrients, but that supplements should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many of us assume that dogs need meat to stay healthy, but in fact, what they really need are the right nutrients,' Ms Brociek added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What I found was surprising – these foods stacked up more closely to meat–based diets than expected, with all showing some nutritional gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With more studies on plant–based pet foods emerging every year, I'm excited to help move this conversation forward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Giving your dog a chunk of meat – or even a bone to chew on – might soon be a thing of the past, according to a new study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of self–declared vegans in the UK has rocketed in recent years, and quadrupled between 2014 and 2019, from 150,000 to 600,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328506"&gt;Plos One&lt;/a&gt;, reads: 'Veganism is increasingly becoming a popular dietary choice for many people, whether it be for health reasons or concerns for animal welfare and/or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Owners of companion animals, who identify as vegetarian or vegan, therefore face an ethical dilemma – should they feed animals to their animals?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It concludes: 'Adopting a plant–based dietary pattern for your companion canine can provide nutritional adequacy with respect to the majority of macro– and micronutrients, with the exception of iodine and B–vitamins, which could easily be supplemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-c664d480-88aa-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-2ef77710-009f-11e8-9256-2f90a6e0b8af" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5304177/SCIENTISTS-REVEAL-DOG-ENJOYS-SCARFING-ITS.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team of scientists from University of California at Davis surveyed thousands of dog owners to figure out why dogs are drawn to eating their own and other dogs' poo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it has nothing to do with breed, age, or training, they did discover that dogs are more likely to eat poop when there are multiple dogs in one home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs are also more likely to eat poop if they're considered 'greedy eaters.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, the impetus for the disgusting behaviour likely has something to do with their wolf ancestors, which ate fresh poop before it became infected with parasites as a way to clean up any droppings left around their dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Don't expect a pill to help prevent poop eating any time soon, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found that food additives and other techniques have no success at preventing dogs from scarfing down faeces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sitting on an open bowl offers no support for the pelvic floor. That puts pressure on veins in the rectum, making them swollen and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2948d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The longer you sit on the toilet, the worse it is for you,” said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institute for Gut-Brain Research Institute in Boston. Pasricha is also an author of the study, which was &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d81198" class="body-graf"&gt;And smartphones are designed to keep people fixated for as long as possible. “They’re completely consuming to us in ways that wasn’t happening to the casual bathroom reader in the 80s,” Pasricha said. “They could much more easily put the newspaper down and get up and leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9617e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and colleagues surveyed 125 adults just before they were about to have a routine colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52fe29" class="body-graf"&gt;Eighty-three (66%) of the participants admitted to using their phones in the bathroom — mostly to catch up on news of the day and scroll through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-525b28" class="body-graf"&gt;Gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopies looked for evidence of inflamed veins, or hemorrhoids. People who said they took their phone into the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to the others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d0d65" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk remained even when researchers accounted for other factors associated with hemorrhoids, including dietary fiber, exercise and constipation or straining while using the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf00d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Hemorrhoids aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they can be bothersome, itchy and even painful. They also bleed sometimes, understandably causing concern and leading to nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(18)30275-1/fulltext/" target="_blank"&gt;4 million doctor’s office and emergency department visits&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-294985" class="body-graf"&gt;Over time, “pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to incontinence, worsen constipation and be associated with rectal pain,” said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, an inflammatory bowel disorder specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Chowdhury was not involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc3395" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, microscopic particles from urine and feces are sent flying through the air when a toilet is flushed. Taking a phone into the bathroom, Chowdhury said, “is kind of gross.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a61c3" class="body-heading"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7c2ae" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, smartphone users in the bathroom tended to be younger, meaning adults in their 40s and 50s, versus people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca875c" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Cima, a colorectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he’s noticed an uptick in recent years of people coming in with hemorrhoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff0ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am seeing younger, earlier- and middle-aged people having more hemorrhoidal complaints, but I can’t tie it to smartphones,” said Cima, who was not involved with the new study. “Maybe it’s because they’re using smartphones or they have better access to care or they’re not eating appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b112d" class="body-heading"&gt;The 5-minute rule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-400844" class="body-graf"&gt;The experts agreed that business on the toilet should take no longer than 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-866a13" class="body-graf"&gt;More than 37% of study participants who used a smartphone in the bathroom stayed for longer than that, compared to 7% of people who kept their phones out of the bathroom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bffb" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and other experts do not advocate for taking a phone into the bathroom. If you absolutely must, set a timer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b09651" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If the magic is not happening within five minutes, it’s not going to happen,” Pasricha said. “Take a breather and try again later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMzJsdnMxT1haOU1IRWlMOVZJVTh3MjJTeDVHVFYtQVJaSG1Pb3l5eU14RWhoVkpVT2lwWWIwVmZmNVlLWk9KQ1NRbkhTYVlYbC1zRzY0OHRyUU5NMVNnMXJRbjY1YTROUzhHc2JoNE15bzdxWUdFUVdUeUtwRURkVndRUWZSOHRqUUphZ1Q3c1F5aFRGT2FINnRGXy1Md19EOEE4SzRycjdmWHPSAVZBVV95cUxPbGhFcDExa2NickRIVEoya1pTc3ZpeDZYdTVIUWdBanZRaWxZWWd1WWxKSzN2a2FlejZucmtYVXhocVJlWUlia1dXOVF0TE1aTHF2cXU2QQ</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，在大便时使用手机会大大增加痔疮的风险- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/toilet-time-hemorrhoid-risk-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            There’s nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one’s family, even just for a few minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000m3b6n534k5eyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000n3b6n01ob0u90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are consequences to sitting longer than we used to on the toilet: People are reporting a higher rate of hemorrhoids when they bring their smartphones to the bathroom, according to &lt;a href="http://plos.io/4mufrh" target="_blank"&gt;a new study in PLOS One.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000o3b6nxj2qx79w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids" target="_blank"&gt;Hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt; are groups of veins in the rectum and outside the anus that can swell and enlarge due to increased pressure, which can create itchiness, discomfort, pain and bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000p3b6ntmvzja6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study’s senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000q3b6nkxmrwzhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All this scrolling is messing with people’s health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000r3b6nfojltjku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The entire business model of these social media apps is to distract us, make us lose track of time and addict us to the algorithm,” Pasricha said. “We’re just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000s3b6n7jwwf14q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Confirmation of hemorrhoids was detected by endoscopy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000t3b6n6b3wwoj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000u3b6nwzle3qkx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. About 37% of smartphone users spend over five minutes on the toilet compared with 7% of non-smartphone users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000v3b6nebdgwnea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Over time, the increased pressure from the toilet seat can cause blood to pool in the rectum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000w3b6n4gi170u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re sitting on an open toilet bowl, you have no pelvic floor support,” Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000x3b6nb42hvdax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000y3b6nj3onxtqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn’t ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. The squatted position is a better option for a smooth bowel movement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000z3b6n2zrt1hxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we’re evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900103b6n5ija0pmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about constipation? The study results suggest the issue is most likely the time spent sitting on the toilet rather than straining, Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900113b6n42c023l2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who used their smartphones weren’t more constipated than those who didn’t, she said. “They didn’t actually strain harder to have a bowel movement than the ones who didn’t. My hypothesis is that it’s passive smartphone use that causes these hemorrhoidal cushions to become engorged and bulge, and that’s what leads to hemorrhoids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900123b6n4xamkbh6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900133b6nsa4ywk1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn’t use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900143b6n5vconroi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900153b6nv0i3giz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The simplest answer is to avoid bringing your phone to the bathroom. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Three to five minutes would be ideal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900163b6n9k78tnn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of expert consensus is three minutes per bowel movement, but everyone is different,” Shukla said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900173b6ngtoe82ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Setting a timer can be helpful if you’re prone to mindless scrolling. Pasricha also recommended checking in with yourself after two TikTok videos to see whether you’re having a productive toilet session. If the magic isn’t happening, it’s better to get up and try again later than to sit and wait on the toilet bowl.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900183b6nvm8jc1e1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghanta explained it best: There are many things in life we’re rushing to get through, and we often say to slow down and take time to smell the roses. But not on the toilet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="gt-block"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a victim of sleep disorder, you might be in luck—an expert may have solved the mystery of why you can't sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep scientists have long suggested banning technology before bed, avoiding caffeine, and sticking to a fixed schedule every night as three simple ways to combat insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, a sleep researcher at Royal Holloway University of London has claimed that these are not the most effective ways to get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Kirsty Vant, five common habits can make insomnia even worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep doesn't come, the temptation is to go to bed earlier or stay up longer in the morning to "compensate."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this strategy often backfires,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more time you spend awake in bed, the more you weaken the mental association between bed and sleep—and strengthen the association between bed and frustration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, people should go to bed a little later and wake up at the same time every morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This strengthens sleep pressure—the body’s natural desire for sleep—and reframes bed as a signal for sleep, not wakefulness,” she told The Conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867041" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg 798w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-437x300.jpg 437w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-184x126.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, scientists often advise avoiding screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a natural hormone that plays a key role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of lighting can create strong contrasts and shadows, which are tiring to the eyes, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, disrupting the natural calming process and contributing to physical and mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, “lying in the dark with nothing to engage your mind can create the perfect storm for anxiety and overthinking, both of which fuel insomnia,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of banning screens altogether, use them strategically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choose calming, non-stimulating content, use 'night mode' options, and avoid mindlessly scrolling through pages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if people are sensitive to caffeine, it is "wise" to avoid it later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Removing it completely “is not always necessary,” she advised. “Understanding your individual response is key.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a recent sleep survey, around one in nine women in the UK—approximately 4.5 million—use a sleep/health app or device, such as a smartwatch, to track their sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleep pattern is presented in the app with diagrams showing minutes spent in the three stages of sleep—light, deep, and REM—with warnings if users don't reach their target hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “overwhelming effort to optimize sleep” is fueling rising cases of insomnia and orthosomnia—the obsession with sleeping “right,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867042" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg 793w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-499x300.jpg 499w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-184x111.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Sleep is an autonomic function, like digestion or blood pressure. While we can influence sleep through healthy habits, we can't force it to happen. Obsessing over sleep quality can paradoxically worsen it," she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, the best approach is to worry less about sleep—and let your body do what it's designed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even expecting to sleep a fixed number of hours each night can increase the risk of insomnia, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Expecting rigid consistency from sleep creates unrealistic expectations. Some nights will be better than others—and that’s normal. Healthy sleep is not a fixed number of hours—it’s dynamic and responsive to our lives. Factors like stress, physical health, age, environment, even parental responsibilities all affect sleep,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insomnia is common and treatable—and no, it’s not your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People often need about 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep after turning off the lights, according to the Sleep Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, a study found that around one in six Britons suffer from insomnia, but 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey of 2,000 people, conducted by The Sleep Charity, found that nine out of ten people experience some kind of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behavior when they can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which is estimated to affect up to 14 million Britons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, sleep deprivation has its own consequences—from irritability and short-term lack of focus, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. /GazetaExpress/&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, some may even be bad for your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666667725001047" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Preventive Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found a clear link between eating an unhealthy plant-based diet and a key biomarker linked to having a heart attack. For the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 7,700 people who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). (Yes, that’s data from more than 20 years ago—but experts say the findings still apply.) All of the participants were at least 20 years old and had no history of heart disease at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study period, the participants reported what they ate over a 24-hour period and gave blood samples to allow the researchers to look for biomarkers of heart disease. The researchers discovered that people who followed a healthy plant-based diet had a 49% lower risk of having higher levels of cardiac troponin I. (Cardiac troponin I is a sign of cardiac muscle damage and is linked to heart attack risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Keatley, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Keatley, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., is co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy; Hosam Hmoud, M.D., cardiology fellow at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital; &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Wong, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Wong, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who followed an &lt;em&gt;unhealthy&lt;/em&gt; plant-based diet had a 65% higher risk of having elevated levels of cardiac troponin I, meaning they had a greater heart attack risk. “Supporting access to and adoption of healthy plant-based diets may be a useful strategy for promoting population-level cardiovascular health,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises a lot of questions about what qualifies as a “healthy” or “unhealthy” plant-based diet, plus the potential impact on your heart. Here’s what cardiologists and dietitians want you to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are certain plant-based foods bad for your heart?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to confuse “plant-based” with “healthy,” but they’re not the same thing, points out &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “The term ‘plant-based’ lacks a universal definition, which creates confusion for consumers,” she says. “Many food manufacturers and restaurants use ‘plant-based’ simply to indicate their products contain no animal ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a lack of animal products doesn’t automatically make a food healthy, Champion points out. &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Keatley, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Keatley, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy, agrees. “Not all plant-based foods are created equal,” he says. “A diet heavy in refined grains, fried foods, sugary beverages, and ultra-processed snacks may technically be ‘plant-based,’ but it lacks the protective compounds that whole fruits, vegetables, legumes, and intact grains provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unhealthy plant foods can spike your blood sugar, contribute to bodily inflammation, contain trans fats, and deliver excess calories without important nutrients, raising the risk of heart disease and other health issues, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that a vegan or vegetarian diet can absolutely be a heart-healthy diet, but eliminating animal products alone does not make a diet healthy,” Champion says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell when plant-based foods are unhealthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways to tell if a plant-based food is unhealthy, according to Keatley: the level of processing and the amount of sodium and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The further a food is from its natural state, the more likely it has lost beneficial nutrients while gaining added sugars, unhealthy fats, or refined starches,” Keatley explains. “Packaged plant-based meals, snacks, or meat alternatives often carry sodium levels comparable to processed meats and may include stabilizers and oils that don’t support cardiovascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champion also recommends being on the lookout for higher amounts of saturated fat, and making sure to read the nutrition label carefully. “The label ‘plant-based’ does not necessarily indicate anything about the healthiness of a food,” she stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to follow a heart-healthy diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, whole foods—not packaged products—are best for your heart health, according to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Wong, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Wong, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “I recommend the DASH Diet,” she says. “It’s low in salt, high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. It focuses on healthier fats like olive oil and avocado rather than animal fats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Mediterranean diet is also helpful for heart health, says Hosam Hmoud, M.D., cardiology fellow at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “I encourage all of my patients to follow a Mediterranean-style diet which consists of whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Keatley suggests filling your plate with whole foods first and building out your diet from there. “Most people already consume a plant-based diet if you look closely—grains, fruits, vegetables, and even snack foods all come from plants,” he points out. “The real distinction isn’t whether something is plant-based or not, but whether it’s minimally processed and nutrient-dense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:53:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9GdFUwXzJCVExOYXJvMzFoLWgwSmlXX3RpT2o4ek01SFZsODRTQWNFSjdqS2tONFJ3Q3FSQTFkaHp4WHA3YVlNaWRSejRsV09nTFVab1dkc1NCb1ZqMzVTRnUwWUdQUnZhdDQ1eWxZWmxsckg5Y3ZJdVVTUQ</guid></item><item><title>猫也可能患上痴呆症。以下是需要注意的八个标志- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-09-cats-dementia.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cat owners don't realize that just like humans, cats can suffer from dementia. A recent paper has even found many similarities between &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.70180" target="_blank"&gt;feline and human dementia&lt;/a&gt;, finding that cognitive impairment may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197458004002337?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;develop in similar ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Some of the symptoms of dementia in cats are even similar to what we might see in humans—though not all of them, of course. Knowing what signs to look out for is important so you can provide your cat with the best care during this phase of its life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome (also known as feline dementia) is an &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/age-related+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;age-related decline&lt;/a&gt; in a cat's cognitive abilities. It's generally characterized by behavioral changes that cannot be attributed to other &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feline dementia is thought to be very common in older cats. One study found that by 15 years of age, more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00386.x" target="_blank"&gt;half of cats&lt;/a&gt; showed signs of dementia. However, some behavior associated with the condition has also been identified in cats &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342728023_Prevalence_of_Disease_and_Age-Related_Behavioural_Changes_in_Cats_Past_and_Present" target="_blank"&gt;as young as 7&lt;/a&gt;. A separate survey of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cat+owners/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cat owners&lt;/a&gt; also found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00386.x" target="_blank"&gt;about 28% of cats&lt;/a&gt; aged between 11 and 14 exhibited at least one behavioral change associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561611000428?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;Behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; are often the first indication that there may be something wrong. There are eight signs to look out for that might indicate &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00386.x?saml_referrer" target="_blank"&gt;your cat has dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Unusual vocalization:&lt;/b&gt; Your cat might start to vocalize excessively, or in new situations. A common example of this is &lt;a href="https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/vetr.3" target="_blank"&gt;meowing loudly at night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Altered interactions:&lt;/b&gt; Cats with dementia sometimes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.09.004" target="_blank"&gt;seek attention more&lt;/a&gt; often or become "clingy." Equally, cats with dementia might interact less than previously, appear irritable or seem not to recognize familiar people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sleep changes:&lt;/b&gt; You may notice changes in your cat's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561611000428?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;sleeping habits&lt;/a&gt;—often becoming restless at night and sleeping more during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. House soiling:&lt;/b&gt; Changes in toilet habits can be a sign of several different conditions, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1938973611000079" target="_blank"&gt;toileting outside the litter tray&lt;/a&gt; can be a common sign of dementia in cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Disorientation:&lt;/b&gt; Just like people with dementia, cats may show &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1938973611000079" target="_blank"&gt;signs of confusion&lt;/a&gt; or wandering behavior. This might appear as losing their bearings, staring blankly at walls, getting stuck behind objects or going to the wrong side of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Changes in activity levels:&lt;/b&gt; A cat with dementia may be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561612000678?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;more or less active than usual&lt;/a&gt;. They may play less often or be less inclined to explore. You might also notice them spending less time taking care of themselves, for example, grooming or washing themselves less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Appearing anxious:&lt;/b&gt; A cat with dementia might show &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561611000428?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;signs of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; in situations that they were previously confident with—such as around familiar people, places or sounds. An anxious cat might hide more often, going under the bed or on top of cupboards to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Learning problems:&lt;/b&gt; Cats with dementia may be unable to perform &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561612000678" target="_blank"&gt;previously learned tasks&lt;/a&gt;, such as finding their food bowl, and may have difficulty learning new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Caring for your cat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's significant overlap between symptoms of feline dementia and other common conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x13511446" target="_blank"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.4226" target="_blank"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt; . So if you see any of these behavioral changes in your cat, you should speak to your vet to rule out these other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into feline dementia is limited. Much of what we know about prevention and treatment is extrapolated from research into humans and dogs. And, as with these other species, there's no cure for dementia in cats. But there are ways of limiting the impact of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain environmental modifications can help stimulate cats, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/vetr.3" target="_blank"&gt;activating their brains and causing nerves to grow&lt;/a&gt;. But the severity of your cat's dementia must be considered before making any of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy or mildly affected cats, promoting play or simulating hunting with interactive toys and encouraging exploration using hide and seek games is thought to &lt;a href="https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/vetr.3" target="_blank"&gt;delay the progression&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in cats with severe &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, changing their environment could lead to confusion and anxiety—&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2011.03.017" target="_blank"&gt;worsening behavioral symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2003.09.007" target="_blank"&gt;Diet changes&lt;/a&gt;—specifically the addition of supplements containing antioxidants (vitamin E and C) and essential fatty acids—may also help to reduce inflammation in the brain, slowing the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, only dog-specific supplements have been tested in scientific research and have been proven to enhance cognition in dogs. But if you do want to try giving these supplements to your cat, be sure you only give them supplements approved for felines. Dog supplements should not be given to cats as they may include substances that are toxic to cats—such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/vec.13142" target="_blank"&gt;alpha lipoic acid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feline &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; is a condition both highly prevalent and challenging to manage. Knowing what symptoms to look out for can ensure your cat gets diagnosed earlier on. This will also ensure you're able to make the necessary changes to its environment or diet that will ultimately improve its quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

This lack of regard for safety is often seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And female mice showed signs of memory problems when it came to recognizing familiar objects or completing mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe these behaviors mimic tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in humans, as men with the disease more likely to be indifferent or unmotivated while women have more memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggests that even being exposed to microplastics for a few weeks could cause lasting damage. And the latest research shows &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622989/How-cancer-causing-microplastics-body-based-age.html"&gt;nearly all Americans have detectable levels of the chemicals in their bodies&lt;/a&gt;, with exposure starting in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of Rhode Island found exposure to microplastics may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in mice (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jaime Ross, study author and professor of neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/02/alzheimers-symptoms-microplastics-mice-study/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm still really surprised by it. I just can't believe that you are exposed to these particles and something like this can happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly 7million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of memory-robbing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, about one in 14 people develop the disease by age 65, and one in three are diagnosed by 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae"&gt;Environmental Research Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at mice who were genetically modified to have the APOE4 mutation, which triples the risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in four Americans have the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the gene on its own significantly increases risk, the researchers caution it does not guarantee developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'If you are carrying APOE4, it doesn't mean you're going to develop Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't want to scare anybody. But it is the largest known risk factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly all Americans have been exposed to microplastics, which seep into vital organs and cause untold damage (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice in the study were also exposed to polystyrene microplastics for three weeks in their drinking water. The microplastics were between 0.1 and two micrometers in diameter, which is a fraction of the width of a human hair strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the exposure period, the researchers conducted behavioral testing, such as maze puzzles and object recognition. In one portion, mice were put in a square pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said healthy mice will generally stick to corners and avoid open spaces for safety reasons, but male mice with the APOE4 mutation who were exposed to microplastics tended to drift toward the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This showed a general lack of motivation or regard for safety, which is common in men with Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Female mice did not show the same behavior, but they did have memory issues and trouble remembering familiar objects significantly more than female mice who weren't exposed to microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also struggled to get through mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'There were very similar sex differences in mice as what people experience.'  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why microplastics raise the risk of Alzheimer's-like behaviors, but repeated exposure has been shown to increase oxidative stress, an imbalance of harmful molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxidative stress induces inflammation and damages cells, including those responsible for memory and executive function, which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can also cross the blood-brain barrier and block blood vessel function, causing brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that because the study was done in mice, it's unclear if humans would suffer the same effects. They also didn't take into account aging, which is the main risk factor for dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said her lab is working on further studies to investigate this relationship. She said: 'The field is so new. Any information will help other people design their studies.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This indicates a heightened health risk due to specific disease outbreaks, and travelers should take extra measures to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Pan American Health Organization warns that chikungunya cases are on the rise across the Americas with the hotspots currently being Brazil (with 210,711 cases) and Bolivia (with 5,159 cases). To date, there have been 55 cases reported in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chikungunya, which is spread by the Aedes mosquito, can cause sudden, agonizing joint pain in the hands and feet that can be so severe that it leaves sufferers unable to move normally for months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, more than 240,000 chikungunya cases and 90 chikungunya-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is a 'nationally notifiable' condition in the US, meaning health authorities can voluntarily report cases to the agency for national tracking and monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a handful of cases pop up in the US every year from people traveling to high-risk areas, it hasn't experienced local transmission since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But with more than 4.7 million US passengers flying internationally on any given day, mosquitoes in America could bite an infected traveler and begin transmitting the virus locally to Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-6b649d60-88cb-11f0-bc15-b319cc469bc9" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; remains a hotbed for the virus and it is currently battling its largest-ever outbreak of the illness with more than 10,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The spread of the mosquito-borne disease triggered a roll out of Covid-like restrictions in August, with disinfectant sprayed in streets and patients &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14976737/china-chikungunya-virus-covid-restrictions-outbreak.html"&gt;quarantined in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports surfaced that Chinese authorities in the city of Foshan cut electricity to some households that were not cooperating with health checks aimed at containing the chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chinese officials also deployed insecticide-spraying drones, 'cannibal' mosquitoes and killer fish to eliminate any insects that could be carrying the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louisa Messenger, a mosquito researcher in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-da3bf340-7490-11f0-8063-3b0c735712d8"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14976737/china-chikungunya-virus-covid-restrictions-outbreak.html"&gt;previously told DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'This outbreak in China is very concerning. It [the virus] could already be here in the US; and really it's just one plane flight away.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak in China remains ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the CDC, travel agencies and cruise lines also issued warnings about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, including chikungunya, dengue and Lyme disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14997619/hawaii-mosquito-dengue-fever-travelers-asia-africa.html"&gt;all of which have been detected in the US&lt;/a&gt; so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This summer, Norwegian Cruise Line warned guests traveling to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/italy/index.html" id="mol-cd9db780-792d-11f0-8038-e3c60c999bab" class=""&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; to use insect repellent and wear clothing treated with permethrin, which can repel ticks and mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are common in Italy, especially around coastal areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authorities in Italy reported the first locally acquired cases of both dengue and chikungunya, prompting the warnings from Norwegian Cruise Line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, one town in Massachusetts closed its parks and fields each evening last September after a man in his 80s caught eastern equine encephalitis from a mosquito bite. The rare but serious disease can cause severe inflammation of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of rising chikungunya cases, health officials in New Jersey state on the Department of Health website: 'The best way to prevent chikungunya is to prevent mosquito bites and avoid travel to areas with ongoing chikungunya outbreaks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is spread to humans from a bite from the Aedes mosquito, which also spread dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika virus. The infection does not spread from person to person through bodily contact or saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 10,000 cases have been detected in China so far, prompting Covid-era protections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above compares chikungunya symptoms to those from Zika virus and Dengue, which are both also spread by mosquitoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, pregnant women who become infected near the time of delivery can pass the virus to their baby during birth, which can result in severe illness in the newborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15 to 35 percent of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, the CDC reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mortality rate for chikungunya is generally low, estimated at less than one in 1,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incubation period is typically three to seven days and the most common symptom is a sudden onset of a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of chikungunya virus include headache, nausea, rash, muscle aches, swelling and redness of the conjunctiva (the white part of the eye and inner eyelids) and joint pain that is sometimes severe and debilitating in the hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, life-threatening complications involving the heart and brain can occur such as inflammation, irregular heartbeats and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms usually last seven to 10 days, but patients may experience lifelong complications such as persistent joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, and doctors mostly focus on easing symptoms like over-the-counter pain and fever medications. However, there are two vaccines available for people visiting an area with an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, chikungunya was rarely detected in American travelers before 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But between 2006 and 2013, the US logged around 30 imported cases a year, all in people who had recently visited affected regions in Asia, Africa or the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, a total of 2,799 cases were reported - including 12 that were locally acquired - in states and territories such as Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, making it the country's worst year on record for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, case numbers have declined and last year, the CDC recorded 199 travel-related chikungunya cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:59:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUi1CU3ROVnNBWFczWXMzZ0M0WU8zdlY4SG9YZTNEM0Y5VDBHdXhsLXlHUXRnYjUzRDk3QXBqQUoxYklqaXNfN1hnYkQtZ256VVVXVE8yVVk5LVBQUk0ybDVka1NzMGthajFDU0l6ckhpT2N1dzVTbFItcmRLNXB0TnhIbEJ4RGJBTGlkX2JjNFJUeGpHd3dRcUhXNFNnMWwyRTExa05UUdIBrAFBVV95cUxObTg0dmVaRHNXeTlRR2dJQW5nVzVUd1dkc3JRcjdISm5SYVEzU1ZmYklOSWNFeDMwbFc1VWYxX3JHa1daVmx3dU1UaUJpUU9ka1ZzenRGbURQQmhZbERTODllaDJlSGJaOGpCdUUwZTNPWVU0N2oyYWh5VUpGVGVlQm96MlBiaE9UaXRpWmtQTS1GN3dHOXJQNmhtaFVzY2hNYjlldU9fa3lQM2M2</guid></item><item><title>FDA质疑人们是否应该同时接种多种呼吸道疫苗-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/03/vaccine-access-covid-flu-fda-safety/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKF049WUR10TZ5B3574D5J8WFG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is scrutinizing the common practice of giving coronavirus and flu shots together, signaling a reversal of years of federal guidance and a broader crackdown on administering multiple vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:51:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQNjJEZUpraHhjSUFwWV9UXzZRVzNEMzZqY3dHejVHNFZVTkhhaHlIUjd0a3M3cDhRWHlVazlvc1lxbEhkdUU3czktLWJ0QlprTXVOdTdSSFVUT0taUDE5bktRekJ4TnpCOUlsOGFkT1JMZzBYUW9iUGV4NW8zbzZNbzhGell5VTFTcTBILWhR</guid></item><item><title>吱吱作响的膝盖对您的长期健康意味着什么- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/what-creaky-knees-really-mean-for-your-long-term-health-2000652662</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Here’s some potential good news for runners or people fresh off knee surgery: Your creaking knees might not indicate deeper health issues. New research finds that knee creaking is not associated with a greater risk of arthritis in people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists at La Trobe University in Australia led the study, which examined the long-term outcomes of young patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Though people with knee creaking did experience more pain on average in the first year following surgery, they ultimately fared no worse than people without creaky knees years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that creaky knees might not be a reliable predictor of future arthritis, even in people healing from traumatic injuries, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A noisy universal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a snap, crackle, and pop knee is formally known as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/osteoarthritis/crepitus"&gt;knee crepitus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a common condition, &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(24)00414-X/fulltext"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to affect about 41% of the general public. While people of all ages can have knee crepitus, including people who aren’t experiencing any pain, studies have shown it’s especially common in people with osteoarthritis. That’s led some doctors to argue that crepitus should be seen as a clear early warning signal of arthritis in high-risk groups, including knee surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test out this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 112 young patients (median age 28) who had their ACL repaired. Following surgery, the participants’ knee health was tracked for five years, which included people’s self-assessment of relevant symptoms like knee pain and crepitus; the participants also received an MRI of their knee one year and five years after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Creaking but not broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though people with crepitus did have a tougher time at first, things eventually balanced out for both groups, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found that those with knee crepitus demonstrated more than two and a half times greater rates of full-thickness cartilage defects in the kneecap area, with more pain and poorer function early on,” said lead author Jamon Couch, a physical therapist and graduate researcher at La Trobe, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-noisy-knees-early-arthritis.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “But over the next four years, those with crepitus did not experience worse pain and function compared to those without knee crepitus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with ruptured ACLs are at higher long-term risk for osteoarthritis in general. So the findings, &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25637"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Arthritis Care and Research, should provide some reassurance that having creaky knees isn’t a sure-fire predictor for later issues, the researchers say, particularly in younger people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ACL patients specifically, there are other reasons to believe knee creaking on its own shouldn’t be seen as a major concern for the average person. A review last year by the same authors &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39375004/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 36% of people without knee pain experience crepitus, for instance, just a smidge below the percentage seen in the overall public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts do &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/by-itself-knee-crunching-sound-generally-not-cause-for-concern/"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people who have other knee symptoms besides crepitus, such as pain or swelling, should consider seeing a doctor to have it checked out. There’s also a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/knee-exercises-for-runners/"&gt;strengthening exercises&lt;/a&gt; out there that can help you improve or maintain your knee health, especially if you run. And being active in general is good for your joints.&lt;/p&gt;

For the &lt;i&gt;PICALM&lt;/i&gt; expression assay, the grey matter was dissected from brain blocks on dry ice. RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo), and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were set up using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix for qPCR (Applied Biosystems) and run on the QuantStudio Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The data were analysed using the &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({2}^{-\Delta \Delta {C}_{t}}\)&lt;/span&gt; method and normalized to &lt;i&gt;COTL1&lt;/i&gt;.

All ROSMAP participants enrolled without known dementia and agreed to detailed clinical evaluation and brain donation at death. Both studies were approved by the Rush University Medical Center IRB. The sections were incubated at 60 °C for 60 min, deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of increasingly dilute ethanol solutions. Epitope retrieval was performed using decloaking buffer (Biocare Medical) at 95 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, freshly prepared 0.1% sodium borohydride was added to the sections and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Peroxidase blocking (3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were then treated with permeabilization buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× TBS) at room temperature for 45 min. Non-specific epitopes were blocked by incubating the sections for 60 min in blocking buffer-I (10% donkey serum, 1% BSA, 0.3 M glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100) followed by a 60 min incubation with background punisher (Biocare Medical). Antibody staining was performed at room temperature using the intelliPATH FLX system and reagents provided by the manufacturer (Biocare Medical). Rabbit anti-PICALM antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019061, 1:200) and goat anti-IBA1 (Abcam, ab5076, 1:1,000) were incubated with the sections for 48 h at 4 °C. After washing, secondary antibodies were applied and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Autofluorescence was quenched using 0.1% Sudan Black B in 70% ethanol, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Finally, coverslips were mounted using VectorShield mounting medium. Images were acquired on an automated Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope fitted with the Yokogawa spinning-disk field-scanning confocal system and Photometrics PRIME 95B sCMOS camera, using a ×20 objective. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; stack images were deconvolved using Nikon NIS-Elements AR5.20.01 software and processed with Fiji/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit). For quantification of PICALM in IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, all processing was conducted by a researcher blinded to individual diagnoses. Images were acquired on the SLIDEVIEW VS200 slide scanner (Olympus) using ×20 magnification. Individual microglia were cropped using OlyVIA software (Olympus). All further processing was conducted in FiJi/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit). Background fluorescence was measured from non-specific tissue staining and normalized by subtracting 50% of the measured values. Binary masks of microglia were generated by thresholding the IBA1 signal, and manually inspected to remove non-specific signals or adjacent cells. PICALM signal was multiplied by the microglial masks, and fluorescence intensities (integrated densities) were measured. Data were plotted and analysed using Prism 10 (GraphPad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;iMG differentiation from human iPS cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs were generated from human iPS cell lines as described in our previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Butler Iii, R.

Haematopoietic medium was prepared by adding to the X-VIVO 15 (BE08-879H, Lonza), 1% GlutaMax (35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (10378016, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol (21985023, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; M-CSF (300-25, PeproTech) and 25 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-3 (200-03, PeproTech). After 5 days of culturing EBs in haematopoietic medium, primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs) started appearing in the suspension and were produced continuously in suspension for 34 days. After 10 days of culturing EBs, PMPs were collected from suspension and plated in RPMI 1640 medium (21870076, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 180,000 cells per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 6- or 12-well plates. Complete iMG medium was as follows: RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS (S11150H, R&amp;amp;D Systems), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% GlutaMax, 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-34 (200-34, PeptroTech) and 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; GM-CSF (300-03, PeproTech). The final differentiation of PMPs into iMGs occurred over 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;iAst cell differentiation from NPCs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPS-cell-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were prepared using PSC neural induction medium (A1647801, Thermo Fisher Scientific). NPCs were differentiated to astrocytes by seeding dissociated single cells at 15,000 cells per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; density on Matrigel-coated plates in astrocyte medium (1801, ScienCell: astrocyte medium, 2% FBS (0010), astrocyte growth supplement (1852) and 10 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin–streptomycin solution (0503)). The initial NPC seeding density and single-cell dissociation are critical, particularly during the first 30 days of differentiation, to efficiently generate a homogenous population of astrocytes. On day −1, NPCs were pipetted with a p1000 pipette 3–5 times to yield a single-cell suspension and inhibit cell death. The NPC medium was switched to the astrocyte medium on day 0. From day 2, cells were fed every 48 h for 20–30 days. After 30 days of differentiation, astrocytes were split 1:3 weekly with Accutase and expanded for up to 120 days (15–17 passages) in the astrocyte medium. The final differentiation of iAst cells occurred over 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Differentiation of glutamatergic neurons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We followed an established protocol to differentiate iPS cells into glutamatergic neurons (iN-Glut)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Zhang, Y. et al.

Images were acquired using the Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary antibodies used for microglial immunofluorescence and their dilutions for incubation were as follows: rat anti-TREM2 (MABN755, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100), rabbit anti-CD45 (SAB4502541, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:200), mouse anti-PU1 (89136, Cell Signalling, 1:100), mouse anti-IBA1 (MA5-27726, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:100), rabbit anti-P2Y12 (702516, Invitrogen, 1:200), rabbit anti-TMEM119 (AB209064, Abcam, 1:100), rabbit anti-PLIN2 (15294-1-AP, Proteintech, 1:200), rabbit anti-ATP6AP2 (SAB2702080, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100), rabbit anti-VAMP1 (702787, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:100), rabbit anti-HMGCR (SAB4200528, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100) and mouse anti-CD74 (14-0747-82, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:100).

Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Plus Kit (74134, Qiagen). cDNAs were reverse transcribed from RNAs using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (4368814, Applied Biosystems). RNA-seq was performed by Novogene on the Illumina NovaSeq 2000 platform with targeted 30 million paired-end reads (2 × 150 bp) per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;RNA-seq data and differential expression analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw FASTQ files were aligned to the human hg38 genome GRCh38.p14 using STAR v.2.7.2 and counted according to GENCODE annotation release version 35 on the fly. The ComBat-seq function from the R package sva was applied to remove batch effects between the two experiments (that is, rounds of iMG differentiation). We subsequently used the R package EdgeR (v.4.0.16) to calculate counts per million values from sva-corrected read counts for PCA analysis and plotting. Differential gene expression analysis was performed by applying general linear models and &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; tests between different groups (risk versus non-risk) (glmQLFit and glmQLFtest functions). When constructing the generalized linear models, we considered cell line ID (CD04 and CD09) as a coefficient to further remove line-specific effects.

Picard tools MarkDuplicate was then used to remove all PCR and optical duplicated reads from the BAM file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further eliminate allelic bias towards reference alleles during the alignment step, we performed WASP (v.0.3.4) calibration on the generated raw BAM files&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="van de Geijn, B., McVicker, G., Gilad, Y. &amp;amp; Pritchard, J.

Subsequently, recalibration of SNPs and indels was performed in tandem using the VariantRecalibrator function (-an DP -an QD -an FS -an SOR -an MQ -an ReadPosRankSum -mode SNP -tranche 100.0 -tranche 99.5 -tranche 95.0 -tranche 90.0) and scores were recalibrated using reference database including HapMap v.3.3 (priority = 15), 1000G_omni v2.5 (priority = 12), Broad Institute 1000G high-confidence SNP list phase 1 (priority = 10), Mills 1000G golden standard INDEL list (priority = 12) and dbSNP v154 (priority = 2). Heterozygous SNP sites with tranche level &amp;gt;99.5% were extracted. To reduce bias introduced by any acquired (or de novo) mutations during cell growth, only SNPs with corresponding rs# records found in dbSNP v154 were retained. Biallelic SNP sites (GT: 0/1) with minimum read depth count (DP) ≥ 20 and minimum reference or alternative allele count ≥ 2 were retained. The binomial &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (non-hyperbolic) were calculated using binom.test(x, n, P = 0.5, alternative = “two.sided”, conf.level = 0.95) from the R package, and Benjamini–Hochberg correction was applied to all qualified SNPs as the correcting factor of the R function p.adjust(x, method = “fdr”).

C20 cells were transduced with filtered virus-containing medium, and stable pools were selected in blasticidin (20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Immunoblots for iMG and C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For iMG, cells were lysed in phosphosafe buffer (71296, EMD Millipore) with protease inhibitor (04693132001, Roche) and PhosphoSTOP tablet (4906845001, Roche). Next, 50 μg of protein lysates were run on TGX Stain-Free Precast Gel (4–15%) (4561083, Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer (1610732, Bio-Rad). The gel was then transferred onto a 0.45-μm PVDF membrane (88585, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with rabbit anti-PICALM (HPA019061, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1,000) or mouse anti-β-actin (A5316, Millipore, 1:10,000) at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit-HRP (7074, Cell Signaling, 1:20,000) and anti-mouse-HRP (7076, Cell Signaling, 1:20,000), were then added. The blots were imaged and quantified using Bio-Rad Image Lab v.6.1.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For C20 line, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche), sonicated and lysates cleared by centrifugation (21,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 2 min). Fifty μg of lysate was used per lane on 4–20% SDS PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Non-specific sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 1% fish gelatin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies rabbit anti-PICALM (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019061, 1:500) and mouse anti-β-actin (Proteintech, 66009-1-lg, 1:50,000) in at 4 °C for 16 h. Secondary antibodies IRDye 680RD donkey anti-rabbit IgG and IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG (Li-COR) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Blots were imaged and quantified on a Li-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Myelin phagocytosis for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myelin isolated from the mouse brain (as described above) was conjugated to pHrodo-Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35369) or pHrodo-Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36600). C20 cells were incubated with pHrodo-conjugated myelin (20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 37 °C (5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 1 h. Negative controls were treated with cytochalasin D (10 nM, Invitrogen). After fixation, cells were stained with rabbit anti-BIN1 antibody (Proteintech, 14647-1-AP, 1:500) for 2 h. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 (Yokogawa spinning-disk field-scanning confocal) microscope at ×20 magnification and captured using a Photometrics PRIME 95B sCMOS camera. Single-plane images were processed using Fiji/ImageJ (v.1.54f, 64 bit) software to threshold whole-cell masks (created from BIN1 staining). The integrated density of pHrodo-myelin within each cell was measured from five random fields of view (per biological replicates) and the median values from each replicate were used for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec47"&gt;LD staining for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live C20 cells were labelled with BODIPY (2 µM in PBS) at 37 °C (5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 15 min. At room temperature, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, and nuclei were labelled with Hoechst 33342. The volumes of BODIPY&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; droplets and the number of nuclei was quantified from deconvolved image stacks using ImageJ (v.1.54f, 64 bit)/Fiji software. Five random fields of view (per biological replicate) were acquired for quantification, and the median values from each biological replicate were used for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec48"&gt;Organelle marker staining for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transferrin endocytosis, C20 cells were washed and incubated in uptake medium (DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES) for 1 h. Cells were treated with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; transferrin Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate (Invitrogen, T35352) in DMEM/HEPES containing 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then chilled to 4 °C, and non-internalized transferrin was washed from cell surfaces with acid wash (0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 M acetic acid, pH 2.8) before fixing the cells in PFA. For cholera toxin internalization, cells were washed with labelling medium (1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; BSA in serum-free DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES), chilled to 4 °C and treated with 100 nM cholera toxin subunit B Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Invitrogen, C34778) in labelling medium at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA (in PBS) at room temperature for 15 min. Nuclei were labelled with Hoechst 33342.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunofluorescence staining with antibodies, C20 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA and blocked (3% BSA, 50 mM NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, 10 mM glycine, PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Giantin (Covance, PRB-114C, 1:5,000), mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610457, 1:500) or mouse anti-AP-4ε (BD Transduction, 612018, 1:100) antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. All C20 cell images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 spinning-disk field-scanning confocal microscope at ×60 magnification. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stacks (100 nm step size) were processed to generate maximum-intensity projections using Fiji/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec49"&gt;Lipid extraction from iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs carrying the &lt;i&gt;PICALM&lt;/i&gt; risk allele, non-risk allele or risk-CRISPRa were grown in six-well plates until day 25. iMGs were dissociated with Accutase (07920, StemCell), collected and washed with PBS three times by centrifugation at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min.

In brief, a deuterated lipid standard mixture (330820, LM6003, 860739, 330727, 860657, 860658, Avanti Research) was added to iMGs equally and organic solvent (chloroform:methanol, 1:2 (v/v)) was added to iMG pellets and subjected to tip sonication, followed by vortexing and centrifugation to extract neutral lipid. The organic layer was collected and saved for later use and acidic extraction was performed on the remaining pellet by a mixture of chloroform:methanol:37% 1 M HCl (40:80:1, v/v/v). After the addition of chloroform and 0.1 M HCl to induce phase separation, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged. The bottom organic layer was combined with the previously collected organic layer and dried using vacuum centrifuge. The dried lipid extract was reconstituted in methanol:chloroform (1:3, v/v) for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec50"&gt;Lipidomics analysis of iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipid extracts were subjected to global lipidomics analysis using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). LC–MS-grade methanol (A456, Thermo Fisher Scientific), acetonitrile (A955, Thermo Fisher Scientific), isopropanol (A461, Thermo Fisher Scientific), water (W71, Thermo Fisher Scientific), formic acid (A117, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ammonium formate (78314, Millipore Sigma) were used. The samples from two different iMG differentiations were analysed, with lipidomics data acquired in two technical replicates for each sample. Reconstituted lipid extracts were separated on a Hypersil GOLD Vanquish C18 UHPLC column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, C18 1.9 μm and 175 Å) using an Orbitrap Tribrid IQ-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to Vanquish Horizon UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A binary gradient was used at a flow rate of 300 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, using mobile phase A (water:acetonitrile, 6:4, with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and organic phase (isopropanol:methanol:acetonitrile, 8:1:1, with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid). In brief, mobile phase B increased from 20% to 95% over 17 min and was maintained at 95% for 5 min for washing. It was ramped down to 20% over 0.1 min and equilibrated for 5 min for the next injection. The analytical column was maintained at 50 °C. A full-scan MS was performed using the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 200. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 15,000 at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 200. MS/MS scans were acquired for 1.5 s, followed by an MS scan. In positive-ion mode, MS/MS fragmentation using a stepped collision energy of 30%, 35% and 40% in higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was performed with a spray voltage of 3.5 kV. In negative-ion mode, a spray voltage of 3 kV and a stepped collision energy of 30%, 35% and 40% in MS/MS acquisition using HCD were used. The acquired tandem mass spectra were processed using LipidSearch v.5.1.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for lipid annotation and quantification. Lipids were identified based on precursor ion masses and their corresponding MS/MS spectra were matched against the database. Annotated lipids were quantified by calculating their peak areas using LipidSearch. All lipids were normalized to the peak area of an internal standard with the same head group as the target lipids. Total lipid levels were determined by summing the peak areas of individual lipid species sharing the same head group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec51"&gt;Imaging quantification and statistical analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For image analyses, we assayed fluorescence intensity, puncta density, puncta area and/or puncta size using the number of samples specified in the corresponding figures. For each FOV, the fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the number of fluorescent puncta by the number of microglia. The puncta number and the total area of puncta were acquired by applying a threshold to the respective fluorescent areas and performing the Analyze particles function. The number of microglia was calculated by applying a threshold to the DAPI fluorescence signal and measuring the number of nuclei through the same function. The images were acquired in a manner that the operator was blinded to the sample and genotype identification. For testing statistical differences between two groups, we used a two-tailed unpaired Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test when the experimental design did not involve multiple batches (for example, different rounds of experiments); otherwise, we used the R packages lme4 and lmerTest to fit data into an LMM to account for potential random effects from different experimental rounds and clones. For statistical tests involving more than two groups, we applied a one-way ANOVA with the appropriate post hoc test (Dunnett or Tukey), while accounting for any possible random effects from experimental rounds when applicable. The data analysis was performed using R v.4.3.2, GraphPad Prism 9 and Microsoft Excel. The results were considered to be significant if &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. All data with error bars were presented as the mean ± s.e.m. For ATAC–seq analysis of ASoC SNPs, the two-sided binomial test in R package was used to test allelic bias, and the Benjamini–Hochberg correction was applied to all qualified ASoC SNPs. For RNA-seq DEG analysis, limma (v.3.58.1)/EdgeR (v.4.0.16) with a generalized linear model (GLM) &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; test was used, and the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values accounting for multiple testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec52"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09486-x#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:39:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1NYjFEUnhXbXhCX1Nxc1NCNTdGd242WnVSSnI1b2dYV2MwcmpFWWZOd0JrcnlORGJoQWttbHBQMUxMUmZLMnhUM0ZQWWxNcGo4MmVTUWY1UTV6ZE9BOEJr</guid></item><item><title>在声音中游泳后，彭萨科拉妇女几乎失去了腿和生命给弧菌-彭萨科拉新闻杂志</title><link>https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2025/09/03/vibro-bacteria-on-pensacola-beach-threatens-life-of-woman-after-swim/85830159007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher is undergoing treatment at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville for wounds she received after doctors were forced to remove much of the tissue on her left calf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;Gallagher started showing symptoms three days after she went boating with her husband and daughter behind the Pensacola Beach Boardwalk and swam near Quietwater Beach in Santa Rosa Sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;Gallagher believes the bacteria infected her body through a small cut on her left leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A Pensacola woman nearly lost her life and her leg to the &lt;a href="/story/news/nation/2025/09/02/flesh-eating-bacteria/85937082007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;flesh-eating bacteria known as vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;, or vibrio, after swimming with her daughter in Santa Rosa Sound off &lt;a href="/story/news/local/2025/08/28/pensacola-beach-history-sailfish-welcome-sign-approved-northwest-florida-tourism/85846555007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Pensacola Beach&lt;/a&gt; on July 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher is currently undergoing treatment at &lt;a href="/story/money/business/2017/08/19/uf-health-sacred-heart-partner-pediatric-and-neonatal-critical-care-transport/579936001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;UF Health Shands Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Gainesville for wounds she received after doctors were forced to remove much of the tissue on her left leg below the knee to stop the &lt;a href="/story/news/2025/08/25/flesh-eating-bacteria-florida-cases-up-to-4-in-escambia-santa-rosa/85821080007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;vibrio bacteria&lt;/a&gt; from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“They debrided my leg down to the bare meat,” Gallagher said in an interview from her hospital bed. “They took most of the muscle, almost down to the bone, basically.

They just have to get out any infected skin and tissue. They’ve got to get it off your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher said she went into septic shock, which caused her organs to fail. She was intubated for nearly a week while medical staff worked to save her, including repeatedly scrubbing and cleaning out her leg and removing any dying tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her family stayed by her bedside around the clock after doctors warned them that she could not only lose her leg but her life to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“They were finally able to get me stable enough to wake me up. Sacred Heart saved my leg, thank God,” Gallagher said. “Mila saw me in the hospital and said, ‘I wish this happened to me and not you,’ and I started crying. That broke my heart. I was like ‘Mila, no, I'm so glad it didn't happen to you. Your little body could not have taken all this that's going on.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Medical staff at Shands are now working to help Gallagher recover. The vibrio bacteria is gone but repairing the damage it caused to her leg isn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She’s had multiple surgeries including having muscle removed from her back and placed on her leg where the bone was exposed. The flap surgery didn’t take due to blood clots, however, and she’ll have to undergo surgery again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Just looking at my leg, it doesn't even look like my leg anymore,” Gallagher described. “It looks deformed right now. The pain is unbelievable. It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire.

I want to make sure that if we do have a sewage spill, the community is aware of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher is grateful for the medical care and support she has received through her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She hopes her story will help protect others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It's been a lot on me and my family,” Gallagher said. “My husband drives to Shands every weekend and stays with me because my mental health has just been horrible. I’ve been strong through it all, but it’s been a lot mentally, emotionally and physically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Pensacola News Journal</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:24:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxObTJOVlZzUXNVQ25Fb1ZXcy1vNVhIVlV5c05QZkZMYnRUQlRPMGhmT1A2M2lJS0dFUjd6Z1Z4SWpKM0M4NDUtdTJ2S2RnX1oxYXlvUnFPb3VUUTRCcmlNbDhTeGVIbmpxdWVJaEFONWJvdUJ2dFpwVDV4NEp4MTM4UldRUEVIcVJRQkVublY3d2FBMDFzUk5uVjFMY3lXbU5fUVBPN3hSb0c2VEZJbERnY0xMek04YUFnRHVyVjlNNmNBSV9qMEhsVmlYRnhRTkJicGtOdmtmajZ5VkNseVE</guid></item><item><title>预灌注糖蛋白B特异性纳米体中和HSV-1和HSV-2 -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09438-5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-references" data-track-component="outbound reference" data-track-context="references section"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-references__item js-c-reading-companion-references-item" data-counter="1."&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-references__text" id="ref-CR1"&gt;James, C. et al.

Calcium signals were collected using the Doric Fluorescence MiniCube and fibre photometry console at a sampling frequency of 12 kHz using Synapse software (v.98, Tucker-Davis Technologies). GCaMP calcium signal (465 nm) and UV isosbestic signal (405 nm) were collected through the same fibre and equalized to record an equivalent signal:noise ratio. MATLAB (v.2022b, Mathworks) scripts provided by Tucker-Davis Technologies were used to down-sample and normalize the fluorescence signal.

Mice were then restrained in plastic 50-ml conical tubes (Fisher Scientific) with holes that were modified to account for the patch cable tethering. Calcium transients were recorded for 5 or 30 min while the mouse remained secured. After the restraint, the mouse was released and recording continued for an additional 15 min. When noted, blood glucose was measured every minute for the duration of a 5 min restraint stress or every 5 min for the duration of a 30 min restraint stress to assess the time course of stress-induced hyperglycaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Territorialized cage stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were tethered to a patch cord, placed in a clean novel cage with bedding, and recording started. A 5 min baseline was collected in the ‘clean’ novel cage before the mouse was manually picked up by the base of the tail and placed in a novel territorialized cage that was previously occupied by 5 males for 1 week. The mice remained in this cage while calcium transients were recorded for 5 or 30 min before the mouse was placed back in the previous clean cage for 5 min. To examine the effects of repeated stress, a cycle of 2 min of territorialized cage exposure, followed by 3 min of clean cage exposure was repeated for a total of 5 novel territorialized cage exposures. To examine the effects of intermediate stress, mice were exposed to a novel territorialized cage for 5 min at intervals of 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h from the initial territorialized cage exposure. When noted, blood glucose was measured every minute for the duration of a 5 min territorialized cage stress or every 5 min for the duration of a 30 min territorialized cage stress to assess the time course of stress-induced hyperglycaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Footshock stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of an acute physical stressor, mice were exposed to a mild footshock. Mice were tethered to a patch cord and placed into a fear conditioning chamber. A 5 min baseline was collected before a 1 s, 1 mA footshock was delivered. The calcium transients were recorded during the shock and post shock for at least 2 min. We scored the calcium response at the time of the shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Robobug stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of an acute visual stressor, mice were tethered to a patch cord and placed into an open field arena. After 5 min, a remote-controlled spider (robobug) was introduced into the open field and began to pursue the mouse at random intervals. The calcium transients were recorded during the approach and post-approach for at least 1 min. We scored the calcium response at the time of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring was performed in a subset of mice during calcium imaging and stress exposure. In brief, under isoflurane anaesthesia, hair was removed from the flank of the mouse and a 2 mm incision made in the skin. The cannula of the continuous glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre 2) was inserted into the incision and the adhesive tape on the monitor firmly applied to the skin. Discontinuous sutures around the sensor attached the adhesive tape to the skin. The sensor was activated, and mice were allowed to recover for 24 h before fibre photometry and stress exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Optogenetics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photostimulation was performed with 10 ms pulses given at 20 Hz for 2 s, repeated every 2 s. The output beam from a 473 nm diode laser (Thorlabs) was controlled by a microcontroller (Uno, Arduino, IDE 2.3.1) running a pulse generation script. The laser was coupled to a 200 µm, NA 0.66 multimode optical fibre (MFC_400/430-0.66_6mm_MF1.25_FLT) (Doric) using a 1.25 mm mating sleeve (Thorlabs) that allowed delivery of the light into the brain by coupling to the implanted fibre optic. Laser power was measured using an optic power meter (Thorlabs) and set at 5 mW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Metabolic studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each experiment, mice were tethered to a patch cable, placed in an open field arena, and habituated for at least 1 h to account for the handling stress. For basal glucose measurements during optogenetic modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 5, 15 and 30 min after the initiation of stimulation. To measure tolerance to a glucose challenge, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after injection of glucose (2 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight) and the initiation of stimulation. To measure gluconeogenic capacity, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (2 g kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Sigma P5280). Data are shown as the change in blood glucose from baseline (immediately before stimulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Stress studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each experiment, mice were tethered to a patch cable, placed in an open field arena, and habituated for at least 1 h to account for the handling stress. Mice were exposed to both restraint and territorialized cage stress as described above. For stressed glucose measurements during optogenetic modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30 min. For 5 min stressors, the mice were optogenetically stimulated for 5 min, beginning at the initiation of stress. For 30 min stressors, the mice were optogenetically stimulated for 15 min, beginning at the initiation of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;In vivo chemogenetic behavioural testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were handled for 5–10 days before experiments. Following stereotaxic surgeries, mice were allowed to recover for 3–6 weeks before the start of testing. Where applicable, CNO (Sigma, NIH) was dissolved in 10% DMSO in saline and delivered at a dose of 3 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, intraperitoneal injection. Investigators were blinded to treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were fasted for 6 h and then either briefly handled and returned to home cage (controls) or restrained in a 50-ml falcon tube with a hole cut for air at the conical end for 5 or 30 min. For 5 min restraint experiments, blood glucose was measured before the initiation of stress, after the 5 min restraint, and 30 min after the initiation of the stress. For 30 min restrain experiments, blood glucose was measured before and after the 30 min restraint period. To measure the hormonal or gene expression responses to stress, mice were rapidly anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane at the end of the restraint period and blood or tissue collected. To measure FOS in the MeA after restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 30 min before restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Repeated restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the effects of chronic repeated restraint stress on blood glucose, blood glucose was measured before and after a 30 min restraint stress at 12 h intervals for a total of 9 restraint sessions. To measure FOS in the MeA after chronic restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Territorialized cage stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in a dirty cage previously occupied by five male mice for one week. Blood glucose or food intake was measured before and after the 5 or 30 min period of territorialized cage exposure. For blood glucose measurement, mice were fasted for 6 h. To measure food intake, mice were food-deprived overnight before being placed in the territorialized cage. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered immediately before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Food intake studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were food-deprived overnight or food-deprived for 6 h in the light phase or allowed to eat ad libitum. Food, either in the form of standard rodent chow or palatable food (peanut butter) was then provided in excess, and consumption of food was measured every hour. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered immediately before food was provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Metabolic studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For baseline glucose measurements after DREADD modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min after intraperitoneal injection of CNO. To measure tolerance to a glucose challenge, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection of glucose (2 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight). When noted, additional blood was collected at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min after glucose injection to measure plasma insulin and glucagon. To measure insulin sensitivity and tolerance to an insulin challenge, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 105 min after injection of insulin (0.4–0.6 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Humulin R HI-210). To measure gluconeogenic capacity, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 105 min after intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (2 g kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Sigma P5280). For all metabolic challenges, CNO was injected 30 min before the challenge (timepoint 0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Open field activity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locomotion and anxiety-like behaviour were measured in either a clear plexiglass 40 × 40 × 30 cm open field arena using Fusion Software (v5.0) (Omnitech Electronics) or a white acrylic 18 × 18 × 18 in arena using Ethovision XT (version xt13, Noldus Information Technology) to quantify behaviour. Distance travelled and time spent in the center of the open field arena were measured. Open field testing lasted 10 min. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Elevated plus maze and light-dark box&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-dark box test was performed in a 40 × 40 × 30 cm arena with a black box placed on half of the arena to shield it from light. The mice were placed in the light portion and tracked using Fusion Software. For the elevated plus maze, the mice were placed on an open arm of an elevated four-arm maze in which two arms are open and two are enclosed. They were tracked using Ethovision software and total time spent in the open arm was measured. Elevated plus maze and light-dark box testing lasted 10 min.For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;High-fat diet&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; expression of DTA or mCherry were fed a high-fat diet (Research Diets, D12492; 60% fat). Food intake, body weight and blood glucose were measured every 3–7 days for 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Metyrapone studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pharmacologically block corticosterone production, mice were injected with metyrapone (50 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, subcutaneous injection, dissolved in 5% Tween 80, Tocris Bioscience) or vehicle 60 min before the initiation of restraint stress, basal glucose measurements, or glucose administration during GTT. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 30 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Neuronal tracing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To trace MeA projection circuits, an injection of AAV8.2-hEF1a-synaptophysin-mCherry was unilaterally injected into the MeA. After 4–6 weeks to allow viral expression, brains were collected and prepared for imaging as described in the Immunohistochemistry section. Sections from the whole brain were imaged to allow unbiased selection of MeA projection targets. After mCherry-labelled regions were identified, fluorescence intensity was quantified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine axonal projection overlap in the MeA, mice were injected with AAVretro-GFP into the VMH and AAVretro-RFP into the BNST to differentially label MeA neurons that project to the VMH and MeA neurons that project to the BNST. Expression of GFP and of RFP in the MeA was quantified to determine axonal projection overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine MeA projection circuit specificity, mice were injected with a AAVretro-GFP into the VMH and AAVretro-RFP into the BNST to differentially label MeA neurons that project to the VMH from MeA neurons that project to the BNST. These mice were exposed to a 30 min restraint stress. To measure FOS in the MeA after restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint. Co-expression of the projection specific GFP or RFP and of FOS in the MeA was quantified to determine the response to stress in the MeA→VMH projection and in the MeA→BNST projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For polysynaptic circuit tracing of MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; to peripheral organs, Ai14 mice were injected with AAV1-Cre into the MeA. After 4-weeks to allow viral expression, mice were injected with PRV152-GFP into the liver. Seven days after the injection of the PRV-GFP, these mice were perfused, and the brains were collected. Co-expression of monosynpatic anterograde RFP expression from the MeA and of polysynaptic retrograde GFP expression from the liver was quantified in the VMH to determine the overlap of neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH and have a polysynaptic connection to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vglut2-cre&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vgat-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice were injected with a AAV9-hSyn-FLE-mGFP-2A-Synaptophysin-mRuby to determine cell-type specificity of MeA neurons that project to its downstream regions. Expression of mRuby in &lt;i&gt;Vglut2-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice was used to determine the proportion of glutamateric neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH, BNST, lateral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area. Expression of mRuby in &lt;i&gt;Vgat-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice was used to determine the proportion of GABAergic neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH, BNST, lateral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Cell-type-specific chemogenetic activation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were injected with a AAV9-CaMKIIa-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, a AAV9-hDlx-GqDREADD-dTomato-Fishell-4, or a AAV9-hSyn-mCherry into the MeA. Mice were allowed 6 weeks for viral expression. For baseline glucose measurements after DREADD modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 min after intraperitoneal injection of CNO (3 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The response to DREADD activation driven by the CAMKIIa promoter or driven by the Dlx promoter was compared to mCherry-expressing control mice to determine the contribution of excitatory or GABAergic neurons to changes in blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Tissue processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood glucose was determined using a Contour or Contour Next EZ glucometer (Bayer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood for plasma hormones was collected in an EDTA-coated tube (Sarstedt Microvette CB 300 K2E 16.444.100), spun for 10 min at 2,000 rpm, 4 °C, and plasma was separated and stored at −80 °C until assay. Plasma levels of insulin (Mercodia 10-1247-01), glucagon (Crystal Chem 81518), corticosterone (Crystal Chem 80556), adrenaline and noradrenaline (Abnova KA1877) were determined by ELISA. Liver glycogen was determined by colorimetric assay (Abcam ab169558). Circulating glycerol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic assay (Sigma-Aldrich TR0100). SpectraMax i3x, (Molecular Devices) with SoftMax Pro (v.7.1.2) were used for ELISA detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine protein levels or gene expression, liver was collected immediately after 30 min restraint or territorialized cage stress. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the collection of liver tissue. MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; hM3DGq-expressing and corresponding control mice were unstressed. MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; hM4DGi and corresponding control mice were 4 h fasted and exposed to a 30 min restraint stress with liver tissue collected immediately after the restraint stress. Liver tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analysis, glycogen and protein analyses, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver tissue (~20 mg) was lysed in 600 µl buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% semi-dehydroascorbate) supplemented with halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Cell Signaling). Livers were first homogenized using Beadbug (Benchmark) and lysates were further sonicated in ice-cold water for 5 min. After centrifuging at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the protein supernatants were transferred to a new tube and protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Thirty micrograms of protein was mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer (BP-11R, Boston BioProducts) and boiled for 5 min before loading on SDS–PAGE. The Bio-Rad wet transfer system was used to transfer proteins for western blotting. PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and further incubated with primary antibodies (dilute in TBST with 3% BSA + 0.05% NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 4 °C overnight. PCK1 (ab70358), PGC1a (ab54481), FoxO1 (ab39670), GAPDH (ab9485) antibodies were from Abcam. G6PC (NBP1-80533) was from Novus Biologicals. All primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution. The membrane was washed 4 times in TBST with shaking for 10 min prior to incubation with secondary antibodies (HRP Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermofisher, 31460, 1: 10,000) and HRP Goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermofisher, 31430,1: 10,000 in TBST)) for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were washed 4 times in TBST with shaking for 10 min at room temperature. Membranes were further reacted with Pierce ECL western blotting substrate and imaged with iBright CL1500 (Thermofisher). Western blots were quantified by Image J (v.1.53k).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Quantitative PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from tissue by homogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by chloroform (Sigma) extraction and isolation using the RNeasy Plus Mini (Qiagen) kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Immediately following the period of stimulation, the liver was collected and flash frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver tissue was collected to determine the flux through the gluconeogenic metabolic pathway by measuring how the stable isotope is incorporated into metabolites. Liver cells were isolated and incorporated into a media, collected to a screw vial, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following thawing on ice, 200 μl of the media was added to 800 μl of methanol. After a brief vortex, the media was centrifuged at 13,100&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial and dried under gentle nitrogen flow. The samples were then subjected to a 2-step derivatization with 50 μl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (MOA, 15 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in pyridine) at 30 °C for 90 min, and then incubated with 50 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA, containing 1% TMCS) at 70 °C for 60 min.

Outliers were defined as values two standard deviations above or below the mean per group per time point (where applicable) and removed from analyses. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values below 0.05 were considered to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure panels were generated with Biorender (&lt;a href="https://app.biorender.com/"&gt;https://app.biorender.com/&lt;/a&gt;) and in Adobe Illustrator (v.2020).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec54"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09420-1#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt;

Throughout the crisis, Kennedy faced criticism from &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some health experts&lt;/a&gt; who described his messaging as inconsistent. They pointed out that while he acknowledged the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/texas-measles-death-child" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;importance of the&lt;/a&gt; measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, he also framed vaccination as a “personal choice” and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; and endorsed &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; such as vitamins and cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The editorial arrives amid growing calls for his resignation, triggered by a disastrous few weeks at the CDC. Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;White House abruptly fired the CDC director&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Susan Monarez, claiming that she did not “&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5474649-white-house-cdc-susan-monarez-firing/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMfM6ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFNa1ZudVFBUXNMU21HdVRqAR6if960QcJ-bTsx9bVdOwWvXmr2Kxk7Ghmq5coD4SiGJ9ktdMvrSKAHr456CA_aem_ADunaI9vqjdotZgT18EJLA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;align&lt;/a&gt;” with Donald Trump’s agenda.

It also blasts him for “appointing political ideologues” to influential vaccine policy positions, “refusing to be briefed by well-regarded CDC experts on vaccine-preventable diseases” and “rescinding the FDA’s emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this week, nine former CDC officials penned a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/former-cdc-officials-rfk-jr-endangering-americans-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guest essay&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times in which they called Kennedy’s leadership “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In that letter, the staffers accused him of fueling harassment and violence directed at government healthcare staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the mounting pressure, Kennedy did not address Monarez’s firing, the subsequent resignations or the growing calls for his resignation in his editorial this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Kennedy defended the Trump administration’s role in what he described as “restoring public trust” in the CDC, which he argued had been “corroded” in recent years by “bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy, who previously founded an anti-vaccine group, also criticized the CDC’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it a “failure”, and blasted policies such as social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, and “the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-presidents-2026-health-care-agenda" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to testify before the Senate finance committee on Thursday for a hearing on Trump’s healthcare agenda, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/ahead-of-rfk-jr-appearance-before-finance-committee-wyden-demands-end-to-secrecy-and-stonewalling-at-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;committee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSEhEU3M0aUgzdHR2LXR3NDNMNnNSNzZXUWJJeWM5Nk5XTWI5SE9Fek9ETXBiMDFyZmliVklrYUJldTl4N2VFaUxPVVAxbjZzaHF0SFc2ZG1IcHo0bkViZVJITW5iVTNkWWNsTGM1RmR3TzNwZmpXZ1dOOEZsU2cweFpRY19GYW1CRlE</guid></item><item><title>性塑造双相情感障碍和精神分裂症的进程-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/schizophrenia-bipolar-sex-differences-29656/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large multicenter study has revealed that sex influences the course and characteristics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia tended to begin treatment later, while men with schizophrenia had the highest rates of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with bipolar disorder showed better functioning and cognitive performance than those with schizophrenia, with women scoring higher in verbal memory and psychomotor speed. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring treatment approaches to sex differences to improve clinical outcomes and long-term care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Women with schizophrenia started treatment later; men had higher substance use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Bipolar patients performed better than schizophrenia patients, especially women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Both groups showed higher thyroid alterations than healthy controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses that affect both males and females, but research in &lt;em&gt;Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica&lt;/em&gt; indicates that sex may influence the characteristics and course of these conditions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research included 1,516 individuals from the multicenter PsyCourse Study: 543 with bipolar disorder, 517 with schizophrenia, and 456 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several differences between groups and sexes were identified in age at diagnosis, age at treatment, illness duration, illicit drug use, and smoking. For example, females in the schizophrenia group were older than males at first outpatient treatment compared with females in the bipolar disorder group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those who were older at first outpatient treatment presented a longer duration of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding substance use, the highest rates were observed in males with schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance than those with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individuals with bipolar disorder, females reported better performance in verbal memory and psychomotor speed than males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both females and males with serious mental illnesses showed higher rates of thyroid alterations than healthy controls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our findings reveal a clear message: sex-sensitive treatment is essential for improving clinical outcomes, promoting healthy habits, and managing comorbidities,” said corresponding author Anabel Martinez-Arán, PhD, of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this schizophrenia and bipolar disorder research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5aba0b2b6b7aaaaa885b2aca9a0bceba6aaa8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Henning-Stout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiley.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Henning-Stout – Wiley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acps.70026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Influence of sex and diagnosis on clinical variables and neurocognitive performance in severe mental illness.

Sex differences are an area of growing interest in SMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to examine potential interactions between sex and diagnosis across a broad range of variables, to compare males and females within SZ and BD, and to investigate sex-specific group differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1516 individuals were included in a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the multicenter PsyCourse Study, including BD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 543), SZ (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 517), and healthy controls (HC) (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 456).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, neurocognitive performance, and somatic comorbidities were assessed. Generalized linear models were used to analyze differences between groups and sexes. False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant interactions were identified in age (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001), age at treatment (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05), illness duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), illicit drug use (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01), and smoking (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05). Differences in substance use were observed across groups and sexes, with the highest rates found in males with SZ. The BD group showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance compared with the SZ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the BD group, females reported better performance in verbal memory (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) and psychomotor speed (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than males. Moreover, both females and males with SMI showed higher rates of thyroid alterations compared with HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01 for females and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002 for males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant sex differences were observed in substance use and somatic comorbidities. Interactions between diagnosis and sex underscore the importance of considering both factors in clinical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need to tailor sex-specific treatment for each patient. Further research is needed to explore the role of sex hormones and other biological and societal factors in the presentation and course of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:57:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9tMS1MN1NyRTAxWnVtTUsyVzJsc1Zya0MwSmRaYnRDTmh6bjFwMlZrQy1weTE4RElzSk1PX2ZrQU1JV0djQ2k0bUtKVGFKS2VDWW92bVFSMXFtazV3REw0Mm5hNUFWUWE5MTJsZ0g0MEV6Slg2dkhmbUgyY2ZFdw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员指出可以在诊断前几年预测痴呆症的新症状- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15060917/Early-senseory-symptom-dementia-years-diagnosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing your sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs that you're developing dementia, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The memory-robbing illness, which affects the lives of millions, causes problems with memory, language and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But changes to our senses—which occur years before the devastating illness is formally diagnosed and appear to be unconnected—could be a key warning sign we are developing the life-shattering disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The German researchers found that this is because the immune system attacks vital nerve fibres linked to detecting scent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team looked at mice, as well as PET brain scans in living patients and post-mortem tissues from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-26a8fec0-88ab-11f0-8195-0fec413e30af" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice, they found early damage to the nerve fibres that link the olfactory bulb—the brain's scent hub—to the locus coeruleus that aids sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the PET scans confirmed the same pathway observed in the rodents was disrupted in living human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, the brain tissue samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients revealed the chemical changes that trick the immune system into destroying the fibres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fresh study suggests loss of sense of smell could be one of the earliest signs of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say these consistent &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62500-8#Sec10"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;, which were published in the journal Nature Communications, strongly show that losing your sense of smell is an early sign of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jochen Herms of the University of Munich said: 'Our findings could pave the way for earlier identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, he explained could 'enable them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical, as while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, other researchers &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798359/signs-dementia-memory-sensory-changes.html"&gt;found &lt;/a&gt;changes in sight, hearing, taste, touch and balance also strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned that problems with spatial awareness—for instance, standing too close to people—are also potential dementia warning signs which can occur up to twenty years before typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic symptoms of dementia include issues with memory, thinking speed, mental sharpness and quickness, language, understanding, judgement and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of  dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include the lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fresh findings follow research published just days ago that revealed a sense of purpose can lower your risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American scientists who published their findings in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry followed more than 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people with ah higher sense of purpose in life were 8 per cent less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective effect was seen even when factors like race, ethnicity, education, genetics and depression are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,' said Aliza Wingo, lead author of the study, and professor at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found those with higher purpose experienced cognitive decline on average 1.4 months later than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;One Teen’s Incredible “Mental Time Travel” Memory System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; recently published in a behavioral sciences journal describes a high school student’s hyperthymesia, an extraordinary ability to retrieve autobiographical memories. &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/teenager-with-hyperthymesia-exhibits-extraordinary-mental-time-travel-abilities"&gt;Teenager With Hyperthymesia Exhibits Extraordinary Mental Time Travel Abilities&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of the study, referred to as TL, was a 17-year-old high school student in France when she came to the researchers’ attention. She had long known her memory was different. As a child, she would casually mention her ability to mentally revisit past events to check for details, only to be accused of lying by her peers. Eventually, she disclosed this ability to her family at age 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL’s recollections were not merely accurate — they were structured. She described a highly organized internal world where memories were stored in a large, rectangular “white room” with a low ceiling. Within this mental space, personal memories were arranged thematically. Sections were dedicated to family life, vacations, friends, and even her collection of soft toys. Each toy had its own memory tag, including information about when and from whom it was received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these recollections were not purely factual. They carried emotional weight and vivid perceptual details. TL could mentally relive events from both her original perspective and from an outside observer’s view. She described, for instance, her first day of school in striking detail: what she wore, the weather, and the precise visual memory of her mother watching her through the fence. These experiences were accompanied by a strong sense of re-experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. The paper’s authors refer to her abilities as “mental time travel”. And this is straight out of Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY"&gt;Inside Out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory storage, TL described three additional rooms in her internal world, each associated with specific emotional functions. A cold “pack ice” room helped her cool down when angry. A “problems room” was empty but served as a space for pacing and thinking. A more uncomfortable “military room,” associated with her father’s absence due to military service, was linked to guilt. These features suggest a broader internal architecture shaped by emotional needs and reflective processes, not just memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My memory does not work like this and it’s always fascinating to discover how other people think and perceive the world; see &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/23/10/does-your-brain-picture-things"&gt;Does Your Brain Picture Things?&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.damninteresting.com"&gt;damn interesting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Left unmanaged, it can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney damage. While medication remains essential for many patients, lifestyle changes, especially diet, can make a significant difference. Beetroot juice is emerging as one such simple, at-home remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with dietary nitrates that turn into nitric oxide in your body, this bright-red juice relaxes blood vessels and can significantly lower systolic blood pressure, sometimes by as much as 7-12 mmHg, as per clinical trials. According to a recent study, drinking beetroot juice daily may help lower high blood pressure naturally, thanks to its high concentration of nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. This compound relaxes and widens blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with any health trend, it’s important to understand both the benefits and the risks. For example, too much nitrate or oxalate may pose risks, especially to kidney health, if not prepared with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一种古老的疾病再次卷土重来- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/03/g-s1-86671/cholera-diarrhea-disease-africa</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Action is needed, not tomorrow, but really now," said Yap Boum of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's talking about a disease that has been around for centuries — cholera — and is rearing its head again in Africa. Over the past three years, cases have more than doubled, with over 230,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths so far this year on the continent. Those cases are spread across 23 countries, up from 15 affected countries in 2022, according to Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a disease that is easily treatable — yet deadly. It can kill someone in a matter of hours if good medical care is not provided promptly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The rising numbers brought African leaders to Lusaka, Zambia, where last week they announced an emergency plan and presidential task force to combat the severe diarrheal infection. The &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Weekly-Bulletin-31-Aug-2025-ENG.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new plan&lt;/a&gt; is a joint effort between Africa CDC and the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO, in a situation report on cholera &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON579" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that the situation "continues to deteriorate, driven by conflict and poverty." It said cholera is "resurging in a number of countries, including some that had not reported substantial case numbers in years, like Chad and the Republic of Congo." Particularly worrisome is that in half a dozen countries over 1% of patients are dying of cholera, "indicating serious gaps in case management and delayed access to care," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection comes from consuming water or food contaminated by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;. Boum says an important part of the new initiative is that it is happening at the presidential level. That allows coordination across countries, as well as across multiple ministries within a country, such as those involved in water infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The actual driver, which is the access to clean water, is not the mandate of the Ministry of Health. So what is changing now is to bring the issue of cholera at the highest level, at the presidential level," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With an estimated budget of $231 million, the emergency plan is focused on the next six months. This includes over 350 cholera treatment centers and hundreds of outpatient treatment locations. An estimated 10 million oral cholera vaccine doses will be needed, and the costs associated with the vaccine will be covered by donations. Boum said one of the mandates of the task force is to mobilize resources for this effort.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The plan's long-term goal is to eliminate cholera as a major public health issue by 2030 — a lofty aim for an ancient infection. Here is what you need to know about this old scourge that's still causing suffering today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera's origins are in India.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been in the Ganges delta from time immemorial," says &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/603/david-sack" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Sack&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who's spent much of his career studying the disease. Cholera began spreading from India throughout the West in the early 1800s with more global trade and travel by ships, he explains. Soon there were cases cropping up all the way from Russia and Western Europe to U.S. cities, including Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a disease that affected large parts of the world," Sack says. With a fatality rate of about 50% if untreated, it killed millions of people as it spread across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At that time, we didn't know what caused it," he says. "We didn't know how to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theories about the cause of the illness were plentiful. The leading suspect was the foul air rising from sewers and piles of rotting trash in cities; poison from the soil was another possible culprit. Others looked higher up for a cause: Some faith leaders said it was retribution by God for sinful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the theories had a common thread, though. There appeared to be a link between cholera and overcrowded urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in the 1850s, an English doctor named John Snow became a legend of public health for figuring out that an outbreak in the Soho neighborhood of London was linked to a single drinking water source. Snow is credited with stopping the raging outbreak, which claimed 10,000 lives across London, by removing the handle from the Broad Street water pump.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Snow argued correctly that water contaminated with sewage was spreading the illness from one resident to another. But he still didn't know exactly what the water was contaminated with; at the time, the pathogen that caused cholera hadn't yet been discovered. He theorized that it might be tiny parasites or germs or some "poison" able to reproduce in the water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Italian scientist Filippo Pacini identified the bacteria that cause cholera. But his discovery wouldn't be widely accepted for decades — and in the meantime, millions more died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast killer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One thing that makes cholera notorious is its speed. The severe gastrointestinal disease can trigger so much diarrhea and vomiting that patients can rapidly become dehydrated. They can lose so much fluid that their internal organs shut down. This can happen over the course of days or just hours.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, there are 1.3 million to 4 million cases and between 21,000 and 143,000 deaths from cholera each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cases crop up throughout the world, particularly when a crisis or conflict strikes and clean drinking water is not available. And Africa has been particularly hard hit, currently accounting for 82% of global cases and nearly 94% of cholera-related deaths, according to Africa CDC. Cholera often spreads when someone ingests water or food that has been contaminated by the bacteria, which can enter the water from the diarrhea of someone who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two main types of cholera outbreaks: those that circulate within countries where outbreaks happen regularly and those that begin spiraling out of control during a crisis, such as a conflict or natural disaster like a flood or an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In war zones like Ukraine, the breakdown of water, sanitation and health infrastructure means that the introduction of cholera can spread rapidly — and disastrously.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As those infrastructure systems crumble in conflict, we can have sewage contamination of our water supply, and then our water supply can be a vehicle to transmit cholera," says &lt;a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/people/faculty/daniele-lantagne" target="_blank"&gt;Daniele Lantagne&lt;/a&gt;, a research professor at the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During its ongoing civil war, for example, Yemen has had the worst cholera outbreak in recorded history with more than 2.5 million cases and around 4,000 deaths, according to the United Nations' &lt;a href="https://www.iom.int/news/acute-diarrhea-and-cholera-outbreak-yemen-exacerbated-decade-conflict-iom-warns" target="_blank"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;. In Chad, the cholera outbreak is driven by the conflict in neighboring Sudan. "You have the mass refugee influx, which leads to overcrowding [in] the camp with unsafe water and sanitation," says Boum. "Whether we are in Ethiopia, in Sudan, in Chad, you always see how the humanitarian crisis is fueling those cholera outbreaks. There is no health without peace."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, natural disasters — which can affect clean water supply — are becoming more common due to climate change. Floods, for example, pollute water, while drought dries up safe drinking water sources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That puts people fleeing areas destroyed by climate disasters at higher risk of exposure to cholera. "Any time you get people moving around, and people having to use water that is not their normal water supply, there's likely to be a risk," says &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/603/david-sack" target="_blank"&gt;Sack&lt;/a&gt;, the professor of international health at Johns Hopkins.. People on the move may end up drinking contaminated water from rivers or other water sources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in places where cholera is newly emerging or remerging, people have little to no immunity from prior cases or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Souped-up sugar water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The good news about cholera is that treatment is actually very simple: It's rehydration," Lantagne says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera is a treatable disease — as long as the patient gets medical attention quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A patient with cholera should never die," Sack says. "If they get to a treatment center in time, if they still have a breath, we can save their life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Treatment consists of simply keeping the person hydrated. If they are capable of drinking, they can be treated with oral rehydration fluids — basically &lt;a href="http://rehydrate.org/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;souped-up sugar water&lt;/a&gt;, like Pedialyte. This strategy works in about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt; of cholera cases. In more severe cases, the patient may need to be given fluids intravenously alongside antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If cholera is treated quickly — within hours, before a patient's health declines — fewer than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/general/index.html#:~:text=With%20prompt%20appropriate%20rehydration%2C%20fewer,should%20seek%20medical%20attention%20promptly." target="_blank"&gt;1%&lt;/a&gt; of patients die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera is also fairly easy to identify. Patients have distinctive stool that is yellowish or whitish — kind of like the color of water that rice is cooked in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there are rapid tests that can check for suspected cases in individuals even before a laboratory confirms an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also three vaccines that can be administered in areas where cholera occurs regularly or when an epidemic begins to take root. Between 1997 and 2012 just 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines were used worldwide, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-05-2018-largest-cholera-vaccine-drive-in-history-to-target-spike-in-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, WHO says that number jumped to over 10 million doses. And in 2023, some 35 million doses were used, says &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/meet-global-oral-cholera-vaccine-stockpile" target="_blank"&gt;Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the vaccine supply is sometimes inadequate, mainly because it has not been a funding priority for other countries. "We don't have enough [vaccines] for every place," Sack says. And it is difficult to venture into conflict zones, like the one in Ukraine, to vaccinate people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2013, however, Gavi established a cholera vaccine stockpile. Any country can request to use these reserves if it's experiencing a cholera outbreak. "Cholera is certainly the stockpile that's used the most," says Allyson Russell, the senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security at Gavi. This year, as of July, she says, "we've sent 30 million doses of cholera emergency vaccines to 12 countries."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The vaccines are given orally, are easy to administer and cost less than $5 a dose to produce and deliver, according to Africa CDC. That means that with enough resources, everyone at risk could be vaccinated. The challenge of providing people with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/08/28/g-s1-85967/water-drink-safe-sanitation-toilet" target="_blank"&gt;safe water and good sanitation&lt;/a&gt; is far more costly but also key to preventing outbreaks. Without it, cholera persists even after an epidemic begins to slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“No matter what happens with [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] and the federal government, we are going to make sure vaccines remain available in Massachusetts,” Healey said in a statement Wednesday. “We are working to ensure that all pharmacies make the vaccine available as soon as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Healey has also touted the state as a leader in an effort to create a regional public health collaboration with other Northeast states, including every New England state except New Hampshire, that would rely on medical societies rather than the CDC for guidance in establishing vaccination policies. On Wednesday, California, Washington, and Oregon announced the creation of a similar “health alliance” to shape immunization policies for those three states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of vaccine skepticism and peddling false information, has upended  the CDC since entering office and has pushed policies that are at odds with  scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, an independent board that advises the CDC on vaccine policy, and replacing them with less qualified people, many of whom share his anti-vaccine or vaccine skeptical ideology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Removing children and pregnant women from the CDC’s immunization schedule for COVID. An independent review this month found young unvaccinated children are vulnerable to serious illness from COVID, and newborns can inherit meaningful immune protections from mothers who get COVID shots while carrying babies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canceling $500 million in federal funding to research new mRNA vaccines and treatments. MRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna saved millions of lives during the  pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommending thimerosal, a preservative, be removed from all vaccines. The CDC’s&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html"&gt; own web site&lt;/a&gt; states thimerosal, used in some flu vaccine, is not harmful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last week, he fired the CDC’s director for refusing to fire top officials or rubber stamp decisions from  his hand-picked advisory committee. Three high-level CDC officials resigned in protest, warning that Kennedy had compromised the agency’s credibility. They warned that Kennedy appeared poised to move beyond COVID vaccines to restrict access to immunizations more widely. Wednesday, more than 1,000 current and former CDC staffers urged Kennedy to resign over his vaccination policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, the United States  experienced its worst measles outbreak in three decades this year, almost entirely driven by infections in people who are not vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University who specializes in public health, welcomed the standing order. Until the state issued it, she said, Massachusetts – despite its reputation for being at the vanguard in public health – was making it hard if not impossible for people to get the new booster approved by the FDA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As she herself found out when she tried to get the booster the past few days, she said, primary care doctors have largely shunted responsibility for administering COVID shots to pharmacies, because physicians are swamped with patients seeking other care. But the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy forbids pharmacists from administering COVID shots without the authorization of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you can’t get it at a pharmacy and you can’t get it at a doctor’s office, you can’t get it,” said Parmet, who was eligible for the shot because she is over the age of 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Not only did the state say that pharmacists could now administer the booster shots without the CDC panel’s authorization, Parmet noted, the Healey administration broadened the group of people who could receive it. .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What they’re trying to do is increase accessibility beyond what the FDA envisioned or suggested,” she said. “This looks like it’s going to address the problem and reassert our leadership in public health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The governor’s standing order authorized pharmacists to administer two Moderna booster vaccines: mNEXSPIKE for people 12 and older and Spikevax for people 5 and older. It also authorized Pfizer’s Comirnaty for people five and older and Novavax’s Nuvaxoid for people 12 and older.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children younger than 5 typically receive vaccines at their pediatrician’s offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a breaking story and will be updated. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Unless you also ditch men entirely, going off birth control means it's statistically &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; likelier that you're going to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look no further than a Texas-based young woman named Ashley Hamrick, who recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/style/birth-control-skepticism-wellness-tiktok.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about her decision to go off her birth control pills, after more than a decade taking them, when she ran across a corner of social media full of glowing, anti-pill influencers advising her to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamrick, aged 26 when she stopped taking the pill, began to wonder whether birth control pills were right for her while watching these beatific young women talking about how much clearer their minds felt following their decision to stop using prescription contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who am I without birth control?" she recalled pondering to the &lt;em&gt;NYT.&lt;/em&gt;  "Will I feel some sort of difference coming off it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perturbed, the young woman's doctor told her that if she wasn't having any negative side effects — which, as Hamrick told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, she wasn't — there was no reason to go off the pill. Instead of heeding that advice, she felt dismissed by the doctor, and decided to sit down with her partner, Ken Contreras, who she'd been with less than a year at the time, to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though neither felt ready to be parents, Contreras ultimately decided that his partner's choice was the most important thing to consider. So Hamrick stopped taking the pill, and the couple didn't begin using any different method to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months of non-contraceptive sex later, nature took its course, and Hamrick got pregnant — and it couldn't have happened at a worse time in recent political history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early months of her pregnancy in 2024, Hamrick watched in horror as Texas continued enacting its draconian post-&lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; agenda, not only banning abortion in almost all scenarios but also, due to the confusing letter of the law, all but cosigned the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/27/texas-abortion-death-porsha-ngumezi/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;deaths of mothers&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the lives of their fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrified of such an outcome, the couple began considering leaving the Longhorn State — and perhaps even the country — for their safety. Thinking about that very real possibility, Hamrick felt "despondent," as she told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Am I depressed?" she wondered during that terrifying time. "Do I really feel like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those hard feelings didn't end with political anxiety. During her maternity leave, while Hamrick was stuck at home and her partner went off to work, she found herself frustrated and isolated as she watched him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was taking it out on him," Hamrick told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. "My whole life felt on pause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her maternity leave complete, Hamrick is now reckoning with the experience of being a young mother. While many of these so-called "&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/style/trump-maga-women.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;wellness influencers&lt;/a&gt;" preach against birth control and the ways it "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ratedlaur/video/7294334071285746986?q=birth%20control&amp;amp;t=1756844373504" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt;" their bodies, very few post honestly about the realities that accompany a lack of contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Hamrick, those realities came hard and fast, first with getting pregnant and then experiencing anxiety, depression, and anger while she handled a pregnancy she wasn't ready for. She's also gone on antidepressants, another target of the &lt;a href="https://atmos.earth/wellness-culture-is-now-peddling-extremism/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;faux-wellness right wing&lt;/a&gt;, including health secretary &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/government-take-away-ssris" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Hamrick also went back on the pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don’t want to get pregnant again," she told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on pregnancy: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/publications-fake-news-pregnancy-robot" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mainstream Publications Are Getting Suckered by a Ridiculous Fake News Story About a "Pregnancy Robot"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:10:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9nQVU0cjhZa0NqZk9VanVfUkMyM1d6NVh2LVhqQlVjZzhOZ2RUUERORzgwY2lsWmlqZG1sNlpSZVdtcGR1aEVCbmZ5VlAtODhvVEZ2TkM1cGpnWlQ5aEpvaHQxaHJvYzBkMWY3MUxkdE1nWFphTm5R</guid></item><item><title>本周人们犯了什么错：加油站“男性增强”药丸- Lifehacker</title><link>https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/why-gas-station-male-enhancement-pills-are-dangerous</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="editor-content" data-autopogo&gt;
        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm sure you've seen displays of "male enhancement" products at your local gas station, liquor store, or head shop. With brand names like "Rhino Power 4000," "Black Mamba," or "X Rated Honey," these "herbal" or "all natural" supplements boast that they will "increase stamina," give you "rock hard power," and "add inches." The packaging may not state it directly, but the overall message is extremely clear: These pills treat erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're like me, you've seen these pills and thought, "These would never work." Well, my skeptical friend, this week &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the ones who are wrong. Gas station boner pills often work exactly as expected—but this isn't because herbal ingredients like ginseng and Yohimbe bark are miracle cures for ED. It's because many of these pills are basically mislabeled Viagra or Cialis. It's true: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; has found all kinds of prescription medication in hundreds of different shady "supplements," but you can still buy them. You shouldn't, but you can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a rack full of unlicensed prescription pills came to be easily available at your local 7-11 is a twisty story. Most of these "supplements" originate in foreign factories, especially in China and India, where pharmaceutical manufacturing is cheaper and less tightly regulated. From there, they are distributed as "dietary supplements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements don’t have to be tested by the Food and Drug Administration before they're sold, so anyone who wants to make a quick buck can fill some capsules with dried grass, call it a supplement, and start selling it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-fda-and-supplement-whack-a-mole"&gt;The FDA and supplement whack-a-mole&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, hiding the active ingredients in Viagra and Cialis in what you call a supplement is against the law, but the FDA doesn't have enforcement power until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the sale. If people get sick or someone complains, the Feds can step in, but not before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To its credit, the FDA steps in frequently. The agency maintains an ever-updated database of problematic "&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Sexual Enhancement and Energy Products,&lt;/a&gt;" where you can read all about the illicit ingredients in supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-green-lumber-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Green Lumber&lt;/a&gt; (contains tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis), &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/himgo-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;HimGo&lt;/a&gt; (contains sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, and diclofenac, an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug), and "&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/versace-real-honey-men-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Versace Real Honey&lt;/a&gt;" (sildenafil, tadalafil, and acetaminophen). The FDA even prosecutes people occasionally for selling this stuff, like Jacksonville "business executive" Jae Hong Kim who &lt;a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2025/06/27/maker-of-2-million-male-enhancement-pills-pleads-to-misbranding-meds/84344398007/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;recently pled guilty&lt;/a&gt; to selling prescription drugs marketed as “Rhino 69” and “MegaZen Power 5000.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kim's story is the exception, not the rule. The FDA may pull Mega-Mamba Mojo pills from the market, but in a few weeks, your local gas station will be selling Lightning Lad Libido pills instead, maybe from the same shell company, but now with a different name. These pills can be produced for pennies and sold for up to $20 per, so the risk/reward ratio is solid for people who sell the stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

&lt;h2 id="why-you-should-not-take-male-enhancement-products-from-gas-stations"&gt;Why you should not take male "enhancement" products from gas stations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't take erection pills from a gas station; first, because you don't need to be &lt;em&gt;enhanced&lt;/em&gt;; you're beautiful how you are, King. But if you're treating erectile dysfunction, you can do better than a shady supplement. Taking strange pills from a gas station is a bad idea for a lot of reasons, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown dosage&lt;/strong&gt;: Even if you know it's sildenafil, you have no idea how much you’re taking, but it's usually "a crap-ton." FDA tests of these products have found amounts of prescription drugs well above what a doctor would order, and that often leads to severe headaches, low blood pressure, dizziness, vision changes, or even heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangerous interactions&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re on heart meds, blood pressure drugs, or nitrates, ED drugs are generally not safe. For that matter, if you're on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; drug they're generally not safe, because literally any drug could be in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomness:&lt;/strong&gt; Lack of honest labeling means that you might get Ginkgo Biloba when you're hoping for Viagra, and vice-versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of confiding in the guy behind the counter at your local head shop, talk to your doctor. They have heard it before, and the prices of real-deal E.D. are usually better than the gas station equivalent. It's $2 to $10 per pill for generic sildenafil (Viagra) and about $6 to $18 per pill for generic tadalafil (Cialis), where gas station drugs can cost as much as $20 per dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-they-still-sell"&gt;Why they still sell &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these pills are dangerous, expensive, and shady, and the FDA constantly warns us not to take them. Why are they still &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;? First because the minimal oversight of dietary supplements has been baked into law since the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)&lt;/a&gt; passed in 1994. But also because these pills offer both an easy solution and an illicit thrill. The combination of curiosity, desperation, and sheepishness makes those shiny packages by the slushie machine an irresistible impulse purchase to some, especially people who are too shy to discuss medical issues with their doctors. So they keep selling because impulse, embarrassment, and weak regulation all collide, and the result is a product that’s as easy to get as it is risky to take. &lt;/p&gt;

If anything, they just got worse. Then, the coughing started—which the mother-of-three thought was the so-called hundred day cough that ran rampage last winter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until she began experiencing breathlessness a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-20bb5730-8813-11f0-b761-7f9717a666fb"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; that she thought it could be something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken on December 20 revealed that she had a significant amount of fluid in her lungs, which doctors were concerned could be a warning sign of blood cancer —and what would be an incurable diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, her haematologist mentioned that around half of patients diagnosed with a different type of cancer, called thymoma—a rare type of cancer that starts in the thymus gland in between the lungs—also have an autoimmune disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve thought she was suffering from common digestive issues when she was unable to finish her meal whilst on holiday with her family in October half term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve (pictured left) with her children Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to the GP who gave her antacids to ease her symptoms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Even still, her doctors' primary concern was blood cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the heartbreaking ordeal, Ms Fanning told the Daily Mail: 'When they detected fluid in my lungs and said they'd need to start treatment immediately my heart sunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Two of my children have birthdays in January, so after my biopsy, I ran around trying to get the last bits together—balloons and presents—the call came two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On January 4 I was told I likely had blood cancer and that they had a bed for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was heartbreaking having to explain to my children that I wasn't going to be there for them. They watched from the window as I left, crying their eyes out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten days later, Ms Fanning was discharged from hospital whilst doctors waited on test results to confirm whether it was blood cancer or in fact thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I asked what my prognosis was, I was told I would just have to be patient and wait for the results. It was horrendous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Devastatingly, the tests confirmed stage four thymoma that had spread to the lining of her lungs, meaning it was incurable—an avoidable prognosis had it been caught earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only in December when she started experiencing breathlessness alongside a persistent cough that she thought it could be something more serious &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to A&amp;amp;E and was immediately referred for scans which revealed fluid in her lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Given her symptoms, doctors were concerned that she could have blood cancer which had spread to the lining of her lungs - an incurable prognosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve was admitted for scans and a biopsy that same day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now Ms Fanning is doing everything she can to see her three children—Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2— grow up, despite being told that palliative chemotherapy, which would give her two years at most, was the only option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other cancers, experts do not know exactly causes thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus is a gland in the chest, between the lungs, which produces and releases hormones and helps the body fight off infections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is thought that people diagnosed with thymoma are more likely to also have an autoimmune disease—which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus gland helps keeps the immune system functioning properly, which may explain the link between autoimmune disease and thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being diagnosed with oral lichen planus a year earlier—an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin which lines the inside of the mouth—after suffering from painful mouth ulcers, the link with thymoma was never mentioned until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning started chemotherapy just over a week later on February 14 2025, but after just one round she was told the dose was too high and her body was struggling to cope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point she weighed just over 6 stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending 10 days in hospital, Maeve was discharged without treatment as doctors waited on the results of further scans which would confirm her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After an agonising wait, Maeve was eventually diagnosed with stage four thymoma - a rare but aggressive type of cancer which forms in the thymus gland between the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heartbreakingly, Maeve was given a very bleak prognosis of two years at most and was told that palliative care was the only option &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve also suffers from a rare autoimmune disease which has been linked with thymoma &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her oncologists reduced the dose and despite responding well to the first three rounds, the treatment had stopped working by round five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now undergoing second line chemotherapy every three weeks to try and keep the cancer under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has paired her medical treatment with complimentary private treatment in the form of  hyperthermia—which works by heating body tissue to help damage and kill cancer cells—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, curcumin infusions and light therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments—which were recommended to her by her nutritionist who specialises in cancer care—will hopefully alter her diagnosis and help her beat cancer for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning added: 'These treatments are life changing, and in some cases have seen people's cancer regress from stage four to earlier stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me its too early to say but I want to do absolutely everything I can to ensure I am alive to see by beautiful children grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was diagnosed, my youngest was just 18 months old and at the time I wasn't sure if Christmas 2024 would be my last with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a horrendous situation, every mother's worst nightmare and this is why I need to do everything I can to ensure I am still with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together with her friends and family Ms Fanning has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jgux5c-help-maeve?"&gt;GoFundMe Page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover the costs of her treatment which sees her travel down to London twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have so far raised around £42,000 which she hopes will see her through until Christmas. Altogether her treatments cost around £11,000 a month—a cost she could never cover alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now due to start proton beam therapy at University College London Hospital later this month which uses high energy proton beams to treat very rare types of cancers close to vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:56:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNOTdVNzNkN3JybzduQThteWFzX2dZZklFLTNIalBjRGxJYlBVQjFCc3RHSTdRMUoxYm13cUFjNEJ3RU53X0hvc0QxNmltVXJxTUFUQ3ZJMlU4N2hNZ0x2c2xYTlJtNXFmaFh1ZFZWMUNITEVXc3ZoS2RNcnFXVFIxQmJER0RNbmY5YlROYlMzMjhqUnNTOUIxM09RQzFsUDRVMmNJTkdOb9IBrAFBVV95cUxQN0xlLVQ0Y2xyV1pjcUQtblNtS3Rnb24yTGlvLVJlVkY3WDdBcmtEc2FJWHFXZDZWMDhpb1NYX2tyTFN1WTY4YU1Mci1BR3BjdDMtbWQyUkpmSlJjVTRtWHQ4WmotLTZSaFJCbzN2b0ZvRjgzYzVwNkwtc2hSN0JZdjFfVEFaNzkta1VQRXZObGcweUJxMHVnUXZoaHhmUXZiaWVkUWFXaUJmSFlf</guid></item></channel></rss>
