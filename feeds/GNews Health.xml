      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Not everyone loves dark chocolate, but it loves you. This bitter-tasting treat is another magnesium hack for better-regulated adrenal glands. In fact, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170273/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;according to the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, a 100g bar contains a staggering 228mg of magnesium — a dosage that’s not far off your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-dosage#migraines" target="_blank"&gt;maximum daily allowance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is for chocolate containing 70–85% of cacao solids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recent research reveals nuanced answers based on age, health status, and goals like weight loss or brain health. Latest data shows moderate egg intake can boost longevity in older adults, support cognition, and maintain cholesterol balance, while overdoing it might tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll dive deep into cutting-edge findings, expert recommendations, and creative ways to enjoy eggs without cracking your health. Let’s get cracking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: What's inside that shell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutrient powerhouses. One large egg delivers about 6–7 g of protein, all nine essential amino acids, and rich vitamins A, D, E, and B12, along with choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, and unsaturated fats. The yolk is the star for brain and eye health; whites offer pure, cholesterol-free protein. Perfect fuel for muscles, minds, and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the recent research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study featured in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has provided new insights into how egg intake relates to overall health. The research tracked nearly 19,000 adults and revealed that those who consumed around 1.5 eggs daily exhibited markedly stronger bones compared to individuals who completely avoided eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, participants who regularly included eggs in their diet displayed a 72% increase in bone density at the femur and an 83% increase in bone density at the spine. These results challenge earlier beliefs about the dangers of egg consumption and underscore their potential benefits for bone health, especially in adults prone to osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the study imply that eggs may offer more health benefits beyond just being a source of high-quality protein. The bone-supporting features of eggs are significant, with the study indicating that consistent consumption of this food could positively impact skeletal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: The benefits in the basket&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are one of nature’s most extraordinary foods – compact nutritional powerhouses that effortlessly combine taste, convenience, and versatility. Thanks to vitamins, minerals, high-quality protein, and brain-boosting choline, eggs support everything from muscle repair to vision and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrient-density unmatched&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are often called “nature’s multivitamin” – and for good reason. A single large egg (≈70–80 kcal) delivers ~6 g high-quality protein (all 9 essential amino acids), significant choline (~113–147 mg), vitamins A, D, E, B12, riboflavin, folate, riboflavin, selenium, zinc, iron, lutein and zeaxanthin, and healthy fats. The yolk supplies most nutrients and fat; whites contribute lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein perfection and weight management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a “biological value” benchmark score of 100 (perfect protein source), eggs support lean muscle repair and metabolic health. Studies show egg-based breakfasts curb appetite, stabilize blood sugar, and help reduce calorie intake later in the day – leading to greater weight loss compared to carb-heavy breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain and mental boosters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks are among the richest dietary sources of choline, vital for neurotransmitter synthesis and cell membrane structure. Pregnant women particularly benefit, with choline supporting fetal brain development. In older adults, choline supports memory and cognitive function-evidenced by reduced Alzheimer’s risk among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eye protection powerhouses&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that concentrate in the retina, shielding eyes from blue light and oxidative damage. Daily intake raises blood levels of these pigments by over 100%, reducing the risks of macular degeneration and cataracts. They’re also rich in vitamin A, essential for vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs once faced backlash due to yolk cholesterol (~186–200 mg per egg). In fact, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/how-many-eggs-can-i-safely-eat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; showed dietary cholesterol raises LDL (“bad”) cholesterol less than saturated fat, and most people can safely enjoy up to 7 eggs per week – which implies only one egg a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research shows dietary cholesterol has less impact on blood cholesterol than saturated fat. Many studies report either neutral or beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk markers – HDL, LDL ratios, inflammation – in most healthy adults. The FDA now designates eggs a “healthful” food, highlighting their low saturated fat and nutrient density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate eggs into your regular diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding eggs wisely to your meals can boost health and enjoyment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Start the day right:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher protein intake—especially leucine and lysine—was linked to lower DKD risk in diabetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both animal and plant foods offer protective amino acids; variety is key for kidney health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant-based proteins with fiber may support blood sugar control and overall kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and with it, associated complications, like diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Diabetic kidney disease is the primary cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a leading contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic kidney disease also raises your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes, you know that protein is essential to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.

Plant protein, however, has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-11762971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;prevent or slow down kidney function decline&lt;/a&gt;. With that said, the evidence is inconclusive, and the 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative states that there is not enough conclusive evidence to recommend one type of protein over another.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, the Initiative lumps all types together and recommends that people with diabetes or kidney disease who are not on dialysis restrict their protein intake to 0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. This is also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people without diabetes, though that recommendation may be too low for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited 378 participants with type 2 diabetes; half were women with an average age of 63. Based on urine tests, participants were split into two groups: those with just diabetes and those with diabetic kidney disease. Of the 378 participants, 237 were categorized as having diabetes without kidney disease, and 141 met the criteria for kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Through structured interviews with registered dietitians, participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires at baseline. From their responses, protein amount and types were calculated. They were then placed into one of three categories based on their protein consumption: less than 0.8 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight (Group 1),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;0.9-1.2 g/kg (Group 2) and more than 1.3 g/kg (Group 3). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also at baseline, demographics like age, sex, diabetes duration and medication use were captured, along with BMI and waist circumference. Blood pressure was measured, and bloodwork was done for fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), both screenings for kidney disease, were calculated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1, which had the lowest overall protein intake, also had the lowest mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (78), followed by Group 2 (85) and Group 3 (87). Typically, a normal eGFR is 90 or higher, and 89 to 60 indicates mild loss of kidney function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1’s serum creatinine levels also suggested lower renal (kidney) function; they also had the highest fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c (an average of blood glucose over three months) and microalbumin levels (UACR). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then broke down types of protein into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Amino acids are what proteins are made of. There are 20 primary amino acids necessary for humans, nine of which are essential amino acids. They’re essential because we need to get them from food, as our bodies cannot make them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What surfaced after statistical analyses were run was that higher overall protein intake, as well as higher intake of certain amino acids—branched-chain (BCAA), aromatic (AAA) and ketogenic amino acids—were all independently associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. In particular, leucine and lysine, two essential amino acids, were most strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers concluded that for non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients, in addition to the recommended total protein intake, the balance of amino acid patterns should be considered. They suggest that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids and histidine, and restriction of tyrosine, methionine and glutamic acid—all amino acids found in higher concentrations in meat—may serve as nutritional strategies to support kidney function.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors note that their findings align with previous studies, suggesting that ketogenic amino acids, in particular, leucine and lysine, may help protect against diabetic kidney disease. While found in many foods, leucine and lysine are abundant in:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dairy, like milk, yogurt and cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds and nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meat, like pork, chicken, turkey, venison, bison and lean beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy products, like tempeh, tofu and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains, like quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you can see, it’s a nice mix of animal and plant proteins that contain these essential amino acids. Whether you have diabetes or not, it’s important to include a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-vegetarian-foods-11762306" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant proteins&lt;/a&gt; are definitely worth prioritizing, as they often include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and struggle with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, consider how much protein you’re eating. Fiber is another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/two-surprising-nutrients-may-impact-blood-sugar-11718212" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;important nutrient for controlling blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and it works even better when combined with protein. Many sources of plant protein will offer both of those nutrients. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/misconception-about-protein-survey-11701426" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Combining animal proteins with a plant source&lt;/a&gt; is another great way to get protein and fiber into your day. For example, yogurt with fruit and nuts or tuna with veggies are filling, tasty options.

Because a variety of foods contain these essential amino acids, there is likely something on the list you’ll enjoy.

              &lt;p&gt;Scientists are developing all sorts of potential new treatments to tackle the most difficult cancer cases—including some that will make you thankful for the existence of herpes and other viruses. Clinical trial data out today shows that a modified version of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can help keep late-stage skin cancer at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern California and others conducted the study, a Phase I/II trial of people with advanced, treatment-resistant melanoma. About a third of patients given the modified virus, in combination with immunotherapy, saw their tumors substantially shrink, while some even experienced a complete regression of their cancer. A larger, definitive trial of the experimental therapy, code-named RP1, is already underway, and the Food and Drug Administration will decide on an approval later this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been intrigued about the promise of cancer-fighting, or oncolytic, viruses for over a century, according to study author Gino In, a medical oncologist at USC’s Keck School of Medicine. But it’s only recently that this potential has started to look within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Most progress has been made just in the last few decades, thanks to advances and progression in gene editing technologies, which have allowed researchers to specifically design oncolytic viruses that are more effective and safer,” In told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSV-1, the primary cause of cold sores, has emerged as a particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8235327/"&gt;promising candidate&lt;/a&gt; for cancer treatment. HSV-1 is a relatively large virus, meaning scientists can replace or add new genes without too much trouble. And though it does use our cells to replicate, like any virus, it doesn’t insert its DNA into a cell’s genome directly, eliminating the risk of certain mutations (an important consideration for safety). A typical HSV-1 infection also isn’t life-threatening and can be treated with antiviral medications if needed, further limiting its potential danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These properties have allowed scientists to create strains of the virus that can selectively target cancer cells. The first herpes-based cancer therapy (T-VEC) was &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/t-vec-melanoma"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2015 for some cases of metastatic melanoma. But researchers like In are especially excited by the new generation of these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RP1 is the brainchild of biotech company Replimune, and it’s one of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpes-virus-cancer-treatment-rp2-1849574410"&gt;several cancer-fighting viruses&lt;/a&gt; that the company is currently developing. Compared to the typical HSV-1 virus, RP1 has been weakened, meaning it shouldn’t be able to cause severe infections. It’s also been modified to not only target cancer cells, but to also boost the immune system’s natural tumor-killing ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These changes make RP1 both safer and better at killing cancer cells than natural HSV-1,” In explained. And while RP1 might be a viable treatment on its own, Replimune is also testing whether it can be even more effective when paired with other existing immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This latest study involved 140 patients from the company’s IGNYTE trial of RP1 conducted across several sites, including at USC. The participants had late-stage melanoma that was unresponsive to earlier immunotherapy treatment. They received both RP1 and nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug commonly used for melanoma, every two weeks for up to four months. If patients responded to the initial treatment, they continued taking nivolumab alone for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, a third of patients saw their tumors decrease in size by at least 30%, the researchers found, and almost one in every six patients had their tumors disappear entirely. Importantly, this shrinkage was seen in tumors directly injected with RP1 as well as uninjected tumors throughout the body—indicating its immune-boosting potential worked as hoped. The combination therapy also appeared to be safe, with most patients only experiencing minor adverse events like fatigue or other flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/246581"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and were &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO-25-01346"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study provides an important new approach for patients with immunotherapy-refractory melanoma; this is very important since about half of all melanoma patients&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;do not benefit from immunotherapy,” said In. “So it provides a new type of treatment, one that is both effective and well tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early trials are primarily intended to vet an experimental treatment’s safety and optimal dosing, not its effectiveness. But given the general outlook of these normally untreatable cases, there’s certainly reason to be optimistic here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Replimune launched a Phase III trial that will test RP1 &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06264180"&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; with nivolumab in around 400 people with treatment-resistant melanoma. But even before this study concludes, RP1 could become available to the public. In January, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/rp1-nivolumab-earns-priority-review-in-anti-pd-1-failed-advanced-melanoma"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to consider the combination therapy for &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/accelerated-approval"&gt;accelerated approval&lt;/a&gt;, a process that allows a novel treatment to be tentatively approved with less direct evidence of its effectiveness (further trial data is still required to secure a full approval). The FDA’s decision on RP1 is scheduled for July 22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In and the USC team will continue to study their data to better understand how RP1 works. But they expect RP1 to become a new option for these resistant melanoma cases, and In notes that RP1 is also being tested for other kinds of cancer. If things keep going right, virus-based therapies like RP1 could soon become the next frontier of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

noted a 333 percent increase in cases among teenagers between 15 to 19 as of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are also expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School found that patients with early-onset colorectal cancers often experience delays in diagnosis because neither physicians nor patients initially suspect that they are suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, doctors are more likely to diagnose patients when they are at advanced stages of the disease - leading to aggressive forms of treatment and lower chances of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to research, reasons such as non-obvious symptoms, lack of routine screening and confusion with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease can contribute to a delay in diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And not only do young people experience a delay in diagnosis but they also endure hardships unique to their age group such as infertility, medical debt and mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said: 'The incidence of GI cancers in adults younger than age 50 is rising globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ongoing research efforts investigating the biology of early-onset GI cancers are critical to developing more effective screening, prevention, and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review of multiple studies focusing on early-onset colorectal, esophagogastric and pancreatic cancers from across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, they also reviewed previous studies on rare early onset gastrointestinal GI cancers including appendix and neuroendocrine tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists particularly focused on studies that highlighted the risk factors, common patterns, observable traits and underlying genetic reasons that cause colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that one of the most common reasons why young people were not being treated during early stages of colon cancer was due to late diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most colorectal cancers start as colon polyps - tumors in the wall of the colon - that are usually non-cancerous and can be removed during colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes these tumors can turn cancerous if left untreated for prolonged periods of time, according to John Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, colorectal cancers do not show symptoms in the early stages - making regular screening tests such as a coloscopy essential to ensure good colon health. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the CDC recommends that people should begin to get colonoscopies at the age of 45 and repeat every five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency notes that people under the age of 45 suffering from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or have a family history of colon cancer should also get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the CDC has no such recommendations for young people experiencing symptoms that may not have a family history of colon cancer or are suffering from related diseases - leading to delayed diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And common symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation), rectal bleeding and weight loss can also be misdiagnosed as IBS or Crohn's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of clear early symptoms combined with irregular screening can lead to delays in colon cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, the researchers involved in this study also revealed the toll a cancer diagnosis can take on a young adult - which can further fuel delays in diagnosis or treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that despite being in their peak earning years, young patients are more likely to experience financial hardship because of their cancer diagnosis due to treatment costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fightcancer.org/policy-resources/survivor-views-majority-cancer-patients-survivors-have-or-expect-have-medical-debt"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network found that nearly half of cancer patients and survivors had medical debt of over $5,000 despite most of them being insured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that those with cancer-related medical debt are three times more likely to be behind on recommended cancer screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, 27 percent of those surveyed with cancer-related medical debt have gone without adequate food and 25 percent have skipped or delayed care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 50 percent of people saw their credit scores decrease and 30 percent had difficulty qualifying for loans - making their financial condition even worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though official guidelines for early-onset and average-onset cancers are the same, researchers emphasized that younger patients are more likely to receive aggressive colon cancer treatment, often without a survival advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that oncologists discuss treatment-related fertility concerns with patients of reproductive age, a recent study found that 50 percent of patients reported that their doctors did not talk to them about the impact of their disease or treatment on having future children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can make it difficult for couples' or individuals to conceive over time and impact their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that early-onset colorectal cancer survivors are also more likely to report problems with anxiety, body image and sexual dysfunction compared to advanced onset survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also more likely to report worse social functioning and physical quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, male patients with early onset colorectal cancers are more likely to suffer depression than those diagnosed with average onset colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the involved researchers concluded that 'a better understanding of underlying etiologies, optimized screening strategies and improved survivorship support is necessary' for young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published today in BJS journal by Oxford University Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Two-thirds of all Alzheimer’s patients and caregivers are female, according to the &lt;a href="https://thewomensalzheimersmovement.org/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://thewomensalzheimersmovement.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement&lt;/a&gt;, meaning women are disproportionately affected by the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the reasons behind that reality aren't totally clear, hormones are likely at play. “Women who have had hysterectomies, gone through early menopause, or had any early loss of estrogen are particularly vulnerable,” says David A. Merrill, MD, PhD, neurologist and geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica. “We know estrogen has a protective effect on the brain and supports healthy brain function.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To make matters worse, Dr. Merrill says the psychological and cognitive processes of getting older mimic the early warning signs of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dementia" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; syndromes (&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; is the most common one).

Is that bad? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Probably not, says Henry Paulson, MD, PhD, neurologist and director of the University of Michigan’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “As we age, our brains change,” he says. “It’s normal for things like our speed of thinking and recall of names to slow down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s-related &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65171543/well-being-brain-health-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65171543/well-being-brain-health-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="memory loss" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; is more than just not being able to remember someone’s name. “[We’re talking about] forgetting major events or having a loss of whole episodes,” Dr. Paulson explains. For example, “You don’t remember going on a beach vacation for three days with your family or attending your grandchild’s birthday party last weekend,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="14" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="brain memory loss concept" title="Brain memory loss concept" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Flavio Coelho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-fj96c5 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Paulson adds that misplacing items—like consistently putting your car keys in the fridge or not knowing what room to find your toothbrush—also falls under the umbrella of memory loss, along with not knowing what day of the week or month it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One more thing: Sometimes people will rely too heavily on tricks like repetition or note-taking to force themselves to remember things they know they’ll forget—so if you (or a loved one) notice you're doing this, it's worth seeing a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-having-issues-with-language-and-vision" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;2. You're having issues with language and vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re struggling with speaking or writing or experiencing visual impairments, it’s also time to contact your doc. Early brain degeneration can make it hard to communicate and engage with your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“You might notice spatial changes in your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a30770184/crohns-disease-eyes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a30770184/crohns-disease-eyes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vision" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; or even have difficulty perceiving the world around you,” explains Dr. Paulson. “When you speak, you’re having to take the long way around and come up with other phrases to explain what you need because you can’t remember the exact word.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, these problems go beyond squinting at the television from across the room or writing the wrong date on your checks, which are all normal parts of aging; early Alzheimer's symptoms would likely be more obvious and ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-cant-seem-to-problem-solve-or-use-good-judgment" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;3. You can't seem to problem solve or use good judgment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are several red flags to look out for within this category, including trouble completing tasks, problem-solving, and displaying poor judgment. According to Dr. Paulson, our brains have to process a range of information in order to productively move through our day-to-day lives. The degeneration brought on by early Alzheimer’s can make something as simple as choosing what to order for lunch a complicated decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People in early stages of the disease may show other signs of cognitive deterioration such as being unable to follow directions or recipes, making serious financial errors, or struggling to maintain a healthy hygiene routine, per the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s Association" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-withdrawing-from-your-social-life" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;4. You're withdrawing from your social life.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Did you (or your aging mother, perhaps) used to be the life of every party—but now you're staying home more and more often from social gatherings? You could be experiencing a normal decrease in energy...or it could be an early warning sign of Alzheimer’s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Paulson says when brain degeneration makes it hard to remember commitments, participate in conversations, or engage fully in social events, many people begin to withdraw from these activities.  Sometimes this is a symptom of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19920419/depression-symptoms-in-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19920419/depression-symptoms-in-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; (which also shouldn’t be ignored), but either way it’s important to seek help if someone’s behavior seems out of character for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-mood-or-personality-seems-drastically-different" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;5. Your mood or personality seems drastically different.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Speaking of out-of-character behavior, when you or someone you love starts acting like a total stranger, it’s time to take those changes seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“This is a little more rare, but we do see it in the early stages,” says Dr. Paulson. “It looks like someone who knows right from wrong suddenly becoming uninhibited, and doing things they never would normally do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It may also manifest as a person having intense mood swings, becoming easily suspicious of others, or showing heightened aggression or sexual behaviors, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/managing-personality-and-behavior-changes-alzheimers" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/managing-personality-and-behavior-changes-alzheimers" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-remember-alzheimers-disease-isnt-common-in-young-people" data-node-id="32" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;But remember, Alzheimer’s disease isn’t common in young people.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So if you're experiencing little memory flubs before &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="your 60s" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;your 60s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unlikely you're dealing with Alzheimer's symptoms (although you should always check in with your doctor if you're concerned). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And if you need help determining the next steps for yourself or a loved one, the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s Association" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt; offers a 24/7 helpline, patient and caregiver resources, and a directory of local support groups for people affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/64ef87e2-cf9b-4d6a-a406-4e3ffb7bc864_1734448715.jpg?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sarah Bradley" title="Headshot of Sarah Bradley" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Sarah Bradley is a freelancer writer from Connecticut, where she lives with her husband and three sons.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt is slightly richer in micronutrients, lower in lactose, and a more consistent source of probiotics, making it a great option for gut health and those with dairy sensitivities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese edges out Greek yogurt in protein content per serving but is notably higher in sodium, which may be a concern for those watching their salt intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both are nutritious, high-protein snacks that support muscle, bone, and immune health—so the “better” choice really depends on your health goals, taste preferences, and dietary needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://cms.greenhouse.dotdash.com/edit/11767885?vertical=REALSIMPLE" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-7109196" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; are extremely popular dairy choices—both are featured ubiquitously across social media. But beyond being tasty additions to sweet and savory recipes alike, they’re equally loved for their unique nutritional benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are made from cow’s milk and touted as &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-dinner-recipes-11737611" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt;, they actually offer slightly different nutrition. Each has their place and may be a better fit for certain individuals, depending on their needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we’ll explore the ins and outs of Greek yogurt and cottage cheese—what makes them unique, the nutrition they offer, and which is a better choice when prioritizing protein intake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First things first, what is Greek yogurt?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Greek yogurt is made by curdling milk and then straining it multiple times to remove a significant amount of liquid whey, to result in a thicker, creamier, and much more tart yogurt than regular yogurt. In turn, it contains less lactose and is significantly higher in protein,” shares Jamie Baham, MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Ladybug Nutrition.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a deeper look into Greek yogurt’s nutrition, here’s the nutrient breakdown, according to the USDA Database&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt (100 grams, around ½ cup)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, you can also expect Greek yogurt to offer plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/probiotic-foods-7643548" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, this nutritional analysis tells us a lot about how Greek yogurt can benefit overall health. “It delivers high-quality protein, probiotics for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, and key nutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/high-calcium-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorus, and vitamins A, B2, and B12,” explains Ali McGowan, MS, RD, LDN, a Boston-based registered dietitian. These nutrients combine to support muscle, tissue, bone, heart, immune, gut, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-that-boost-metabolism" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And given that Greek yogurt is &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/cheese-can-eat-lactose-intolerant" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower in lactose&lt;/a&gt; than regular yogurt, it may be an especially smart choice for those sensitive to lactose. “For my patients who are lactose intolerant, Greek yogurt is also a safer option when testing tolerance with yogurt, since it tends to be lower in lactose than milk, regular yogurt, and even ice cream,” shares Baham. “Plus, the live and active cultures in Greek yogurt help further break down the lactose&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, making it even easier to digest.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maybe the only concern surrounding this dairy product is its saturated fat content. While some research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shows full-fat dairy, like yogurt, to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be linked to higher cholesterol or heart disease risk, other studies tie saturated fat to increased cholesterol levels&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in turn upping cardiovascular disease risk. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fermented-foods-8783423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermentation process&lt;/a&gt; involved in Greek yogurt (and cottage cheese) thankfully converts some of its saturated fat&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, further quelling this concern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fermented dairy&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, like Greek yogurt, has been associated with benefits for bone, metabolic, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune health&lt;/a&gt;,” McGowan concludes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-cottage-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Cottage Cheese?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever trendy on social media, many of us likely are pretty familiar with cottage cheese. However, if you’re not, “cottage cheese is a soft, fresh cheese made from curdled milk,” explains McGowan. “It’s made by acidifying milk, which separates the whey from the curds,” Baham adds, with those curds going on to become cottage cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a closer look at cottage cheese nutrition, according to the USDA&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Plain Cottage Cheese, Full Fat (100 grams, around ½ cup)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macronutrients&lt;br&gt;Calories: &lt;/strong&gt;105 calories&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;12 grams (g)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total Carbohydrates: &lt;/strong&gt;5 g&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fat: &lt;/strong&gt;4.2 g&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Saturated Fat: &lt;/strong&gt;2.6 g
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Micronutrients&lt;br&gt;Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.16mg, 13% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin B12: &lt;/strong&gt;0.7 micrograms (mcg), 29% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin A: &lt;/strong&gt;36 mcg, 5% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calcium:&lt;/strong&gt; 88 mg, 9% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zinc: &lt;/strong&gt;0.45 mg, 5% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phosphorus:&lt;/strong&gt; 154 mg, 12% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selenium:&lt;/strong&gt; 9.7 mcg, 18% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt; 350 mg, 18% DV
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain brands of cottage cheese also contain digestion-supporting probiotics—but not all of them. “Generally, cottage cheese is rich in casein—a slow-digesting protein that helps with satiety and muscle repair—and provides calcium, selenium, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins,&lt;/a&gt;” shares McGowan. Speaking of B vitamins, “this protein-packed dairy food is also a great source of riboflavin (B2), which plays a key &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; role in reducing cell damage&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” Baham adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, cottage cheese is pretty darn similar to Greek yogurt in terms of health benefits. “Like Greek yogurt, it’s a nutrient-dense, high-protein option that can support &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-bone-health-7495764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and weight management,” McGowan summarizes—alongside championing energy metabolism and gut, heart, and immune health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-which-dairy-product-is-better-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Which Dairy Product Is Better for You? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But this brings us to the question, which of these dairy products is actually better for you?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the numbers are very similar, Greek yogurt offers slightly more micronutrients pretty much across the board compared to cottage cheese, with the exception of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-phosphorus-7567264" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt; and sodium. It’s also slightly lower in calories, a more reliable source of probiotics, and generally lower in lactose. There’s virtually no difference between the fat and saturated fat content of the two dairy products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The sodium in cottage cheese, however, is not to be overlooked, as one small half cup serving provides almost a fifth of your daily allowance of the mineral—and most of us eat more than half a cup in one sitting. While cottage cheese might be the only high-sodium food one has in a day, that’s often not the case—and prolonged &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; can lead to elevated blood pressure levels over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when deciding which of the two is the better &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-snacks-keep-you-energized-longer-than-granola-bar-11761162" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;high-protein&lt;/em&gt; snack&lt;/a&gt;, cottage cheese technically wins, as it boasts three more grams per serving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, they’re both excellent choices that offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/high-protein-cheeses-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, calcium, and a range of other beneficial micronutrients. “‘Better’ really depends on the individual and their specific health goals,” Baham agrees. “If you’re trying to reduce your protein intake—like in the case of chronic kidney disease, for example—a dollop of Greek yogurt will be lower in protein than a dollop of cottage cheese. If you’re trying to increase your calcium intake, Greek yogurt tends to be higher per serving than cottage cheese,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taste preference plays a role here, too. “It also comes down to what you enjoy. Greek yogurt contains probiotics and has a tangy, smooth texture, while cottage cheese offers a milder taste and chunkier consistency,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of which dairy option you choose, plain varieties are always the best picks to avoid sneaky pro-inflammatory added sugars&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Also be sure to look for cottage cheese that contains &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/what-is-a-probiotic" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; (usually advertised on the packaging).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With your plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, the culinary possibilities are nearly endless. “I love adding Greek yogurt to boost the probiotics and protein in my &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/heathy-breakfast-smoothies" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, or using it as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/sour-cream" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;substitute for sour cream&lt;/a&gt; or mayo in my homemade dressings, whereas I like to use cottage cheese in both savory and sweet dishes like tasty dips, fluffy pancakes, and even homemade ice cream to reduce fat and added sugars,” shares Baham.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, McGowan loves “adding fruit, nuts, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, or spices like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/cinnamon-benefits" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; or Everything Bagel seasoning for extra flavor to either Greek yogurt or cottage cheese.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, it’s hard to go wrong with either dairy choice, as both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese offer a range of beneficial nutrients and satiating protein, sure to keep you energized throughout the day.&lt;br&gt;

In people with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, adding 1,000 daily steps lowered overall death risk by 9% and heart‑related death risk by 8% in a twelve‑year U.S. cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call those outcomes reductions in &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/all-cause-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;all‑cause mortality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10809869/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular mortality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found little extra benefit above 8,250 steps for overall survival and 9,700 for heart health, a range well under the folklore goal of 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers echo a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2734709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2019 trial&lt;/a&gt; of older women in which 7,500 steps delivered the same survival edge as 10,000. Led by &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/i-min-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. I‑Min Lee&lt;/a&gt; of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, this research supported the idea that most people can stop chasing ever‑higher counts once they reach a moderate plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simple message could perhaps be refined to, ‘Some stepping is good. More is better, up to a certain point,’” said Lee, explaining that health gains plateau after that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea dates back to 1965, when a Japanese pedometer maker coined “&lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Mythbusting-The-10000-Steps-Per-Day-Trend.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Manpo‑kei&lt;/a&gt;,” or 10,000‑step meter, as a catchy slogan rather than a physiologic milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-the-sweet-spot"&gt;Finding the sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting 8,000 to 9,700 steps translates to about 3.8 to 4.8 miles for an average adult stride. At that distance, energy expenditure lands near 300 to 400 calories, a figure the research team noted can help shave roughly one pound a week when paired with mindful eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher body weight&lt;/a&gt; tend to burn more calories per step, while lighter individuals may need more distance to match that burn. Either way, reaching the same calorie goals depends on stride length, walking pace, and overall effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same twelve‑year U.S. cohort study that pinpointed 8,250 steps showed risk curves flattening beyond that mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers think the body’s major adaptations, better blood‑pressure control, improved insulin sensitivity, stronger leg muscles, occur early, then taper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than pushing for 15,000 steps, time‑pressed adults can focus on hitting the middle ground consistently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumulating steps on two or three separate days each week still cut ten‑year &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;death risk&lt;/a&gt; by about fifteen percent in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/how-many-steps-a-day-health-benefits-7375335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-healthy-steps-into-timelines"&gt;Turning healthy steps into timelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple rule converts steps to distance: two thousand steps equal one mile for most people. Using that, 8,000 steps equal about four miles, which most folks cover in eighty minutes of leisurely walking or forty‑five minutes at a brisk clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pace terms, keeping conversation but not singing comfortably marks &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/japanese-interval-walking-training-technique-iwt-improves-health-prevents-disease/"&gt;moderate intensity&lt;/a&gt;. Heart‑rate monitors read roughly fifty to seventy percent of maximum during these walks, the sweet zone for cardiovascular conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who prefer time targets can aim for 150 minutes of moderate walking per week, the level in federal activity guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread across seven days, that’s just over twenty minutes daily, slightly less than the time needed for 4,000 steps but far short of 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginner? Start slow. Build consistency first, then distance, per the implications of the findings. Once consistency feels easy, adding an extra block or two extends the workout without scheduling gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-age-health-and-walking-distance"&gt;Age, health, and walking distance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, baseline fitness, and chronic conditions shape the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/"&gt;ideal daily distance&lt;/a&gt;. People over sixty often see benefits plateau near 6,000 to 8,000 steps, according to the study mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, younger adults can climb to 10,000 before gains level off, according to Lee’s pooled analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight‑loss seekers may stretch walks beyond the plateau because calorie balance, not mortality curves, dictates fat loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigger goals = longer walks,” an idea that underscores that cutting calories works best alongside extra movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those living with joint pain can still gain overall health benefits by combining short walks with cycling or water exercise to protect knees while keeping step counts modest. Smartwatches capture equivalent “active minutes,” ensuring effort registers even without heel strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical limits aside, the most reliable predictor of long‑term success is enjoyment. If neighborhood strolls bore you, shifting to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;park trails&lt;/a&gt;, mall loops, or treadmill podcasts can supply variety without complicating the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-yourself-better-health"&gt;Walking yourself better health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time scarcity derails many routines, but short bouts add up. The research &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;offers a template&lt;/a&gt;: “Morning reset,” “Lunchtime stroll,” and “Evening unwind” sessions lasting ten to fifteen minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping elevators for stairs, parking farther from the store, or pacing during phone calls collects hidden steps. A mile‑and‑a‑half grocery run with reusable bags in hand turns errands into strength training and step boosting at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking helps: pedometer apps reward mini‑wins and reveal idle stretches begging for micro‑walks. Celebrating streaks reinforces habit loops, a psychological trick as potent as any shoe technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, pairing walks with friends or pets injects accountability and pleasure. Social walkers often over‑shoot goals without noticing, a happy accident that health research fully supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-21216-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:38:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPajhQU181bTNJeVd1dEI5aDlYdU5yZWotY3dYTDdfWkNlNWM2Ym13ZDB0b2JzY2pIT3NRcWh5bTVBSkhIUFdXZlZQSEczemd5andJWWpfZ0poNG9ZdzBMWGhYTGtoOW93VFBUTXJxbTRUZ2hkV3QycnlUTUtvV0FiaHdxMUVpSEpieDJSeE5kRXMxd3lO</guid></item><item><title>阳光对健康有哪些好处？ -《纽约时报》 | What are the Health Benefits of Sunshine? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1XcE1PcmVXV0JGdjBlTDloTENZbWtVX2pSM3Y0X3JpXzVMSXZwNzg0blJ2RkRFVjNRT3duenRqcXczaVBPVFAxM1M0UXBZR3pwT1FlX21mVC1UZ1QwZHp2LVp4SW1HUGJqSzBMWHR6MlM5dmpTbFFTUTBGNEFqUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:32:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1XcE1PcmVXV0JGdjBlTDloTENZbWtVX2pSM3Y0X3JpXzVMSXZwNzg0blJ2RkRFVjNRT3duenRqcXczaVBPVFAxM1M0UXBZR3pwT1FlX21mVC1UZ1QwZHp2LVp4SW1HUGJqSzBMWHR6MlM5dmpTbFFTUTBGNEFqUQ</guid></item><item><title>诺华获批首款针对新生儿和婴儿的疟疾药物--路透社 | Novartis wins approval for first malaria drug for newborns and babies - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNeVV1Qm1UcHdjbTJiRzc2NUJqb21ndTN5T3hjdVZ4N3k0UlNoQ2FmM2lWSXB6ZTU5eGIwTDBxaGVWQkhSYW5ZQTdDZmFaR2xIZ3MxeENxb291RDBHSVhQX2c1YjY5LWEtRXFhV3o1dmNzYWNRNXNBRFB6V3VXdThlc1hNR0VxSHpMWGZmbk9lUGxyRERtc2dYLVl6OXRDeDh5VWJVQ0hFRU51X2pUOHdkM2RQWU1QTXVKbFVXTk9YVXVDSlQ4eW9mSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:17:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNeVV1Qm1UcHdjbTJiRzc2NUJqb21ndTN5T3hjdVZ4N3k0UlNoQ2FmM2lWSXB6ZTU5eGIwTDBxaGVWQkhSYW5ZQTdDZmFaR2xIZ3MxeENxb291RDBHSVhQX2c1YjY5LWEtRXFhV3o1dmNzYWNRNXNBRFB6V3VXdThlc1hNR0VxSHpMWGZmbk9lUGxyRERtc2dYLVl6OXRDeDh5VWJVQ0hFRU51X2pUOHdkM2RQWU1QTXVKbFVXTk9YVXVDSlQ4eW9mSQ</guid></item><item><title>运动真的能改善心理健康吗？新的研究揭示了令人惊讶的事实-研究发现 | Does Exercise Really Improve Mental Health?

&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New research highlights that the link between exercise and mental health is more complex than widely believed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leisure-time activities like sports or gym workouts are consistently linked to lower depression and anxiety, but work-related or household chores may not provide the same benefit, and can sometimes correlate with worse outcomes for some groups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Placebo effects and contextual factors, like group settings or supportive programs, play a huge role in whether exercise helps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The authors argue that while exercise can help, it won’t fix the broader social and economic drivers of mental health issues on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATHENS, Ga. —&lt;/strong&gt; For decades, the prescription has been simple: feeling down? Hit the gym. Stressed? Go for a run. Depression got you down? Start lifting weights. But new research from top universities is turning this conventional wisdom on its head, revealing that the relationship between exercise and mental health is far more complicated than anyone imagined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/2025/05000/up_for_debate__does_regular_physical_activity.17.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that while exercise does benefit mental health, the effects are often smaller than expected and may be largely due to placebo responses. Even more surprising: certain types of physical activity, such &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;household chores&lt;/a&gt; or work-related movement, might not provide the same mental health benefits, and in some cases may even be linked to worse outcomes for certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team noted that “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-mental-health-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health benefits of exercise&lt;/a&gt; may be partially a placebo response or result from contextual factors surrounding exercise programs.” This revelation comes as America grapples with a mental health crisis, with 10% of adults and 20% of teens experiencing depression annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, if a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soccer player&lt;/a&gt; runs down the field and kicks the game-winning ball, their mental health is fantastic,” said co-author Patrick O’Connor, of the University of Georgia, in a statement. “In contrast, if you do the exact same exercise but miss the goal and people are blaming you, you likely feel very differently. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-exercise-equity-gap-nobody-talks-about"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Exercise Equity Gap Nobody Talks About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed a troubling disparity in who actually benefits from physical activity. Large-scale population studies consistently show that people who engage in recreational exercise — sports, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hiking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt;, gym workouts — report lower rates of depression and anxiety. But this advantage doesn’t extend to other forms of movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Latino adults in the United States have the highest overall physical activity levels when measured by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fitness-trackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt;, but most of it comes from manual labor jobs rather than leisure activities. Despite being the most physically active group, they have the lowest rates of recreational exercise among all ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates what researchers describe as a potential equity problem. People who lack time, money, or safe access to recreational facilities are told to exercise more while receiving little psychological benefit from their existing physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-placebo-effect-problem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials present an even more complex picture. While &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hundreds of studies&lt;/a&gt; show exercise can improve mental health symptoms, they suffer from a fundamental flaw: participants always know whether they’re exercising or sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike drug studies where patients receive identical-looking pills, it’s impossible to hide whether someone is running on a treadmill or doing nothing. This creates what researchers call “outcome expectations,” which is when people expect exercise to help because that’s what they’ve been told their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one analysis examining &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/adhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in children, researchers estimated that roughly half of exercise’s benefits came from the activity itself, while the other half stemmed from contextual factors like behavior management programs. When researchers compared exercise programs to equally engaging activities like arts and crafts, the mental health advantages of exercise often disappeared or shrank dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most exercise studies also fall short of medical research standards, lasting less than six months with fewer than 100 participants, while FDA guidelines recommend following 100–300 people for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-context-matters-more-than-cardio"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Matters More Than Cardio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most eye-opening discovery involves how, where, and with whom people exercise. Studies of children with ADHD found that physical activity programs only worked after researchers added psychological interventions like behavior management and reward systems — treatments that reduce ADHD symptoms on their own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;College students participating in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/children-team-sports-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;group sports&lt;/a&gt; showed better mental health than solo exercisers, regardless of how much they actually moved. After-school programs with better-trained staff produced superior mental health outcomes in children, independent of the physical activities involved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several studies also revealed a “U-shaped” relationship between exercise and mental health: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-50s-prevent-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;some activity beats none&lt;/a&gt;, but extremely high levels can actually worsen psychological outcomes. This pattern appeared across depression, anxiety, and other mental health measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-exercise-as-mental-health-medicine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Exercise as Mental Health Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team argues that treating exercise as a mental health cure-all distracts from addressing America’s real psychological wellness crisis. Social factors like economic stability, housing security, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare access&lt;/a&gt; likely matter much more than individual exercise habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers put it: “Just as physical inactivity did not cause a mental health crisis of this magnitude, neither will physical activity solve our mental health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mental health&lt;/a&gt; professionals routinely prescribe exercise, insurance companies promote gym memberships as wellness benefits, and public health campaigns encourage physical activity as a psychological solution. But if household chores, work movement, and commuting don’t provide the same benefits as leisure exercise, these recommendations may miss the mark entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest recognizing that context matters enormously &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;when it comes to exercise&lt;/a&gt;; not all physical activity provides equal benefits, and exercise works best as part of comprehensive mental health strategies rather than a standalone fix. Rather than abandoning exercise entirely, understanding its limitations may be key to unlocking its true potential for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a comprehensive review examining physical activity and mental health from three angles. They analyzed published studies and searched three major databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) from 2018-2023, reviewing 710 abstracts. The team examined different types of physical activity (leisure, work, transportation, household) and evaluated existing research on exercise interventions and contextual factors that influence mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leisure-time physical activity consistently linked to reduced depression, anxiety, and dementia risk in large population studies. However, evidence for mental health benefits from work, transportation, or household physical activity was limited or mixed. Clinical trials supported exercise benefits but showed small effect sizes, especially in healthy populations. Approximately half of exercise’s mental health benefits may be due to placebo effects. Contextual factors like social environment and program quality significantly influenced outcomes independent of physical activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most exercise studies were too small (under 100 participants) and short (under 6 months) for reliable conclusions. Participants can’t be blinded to exercise interventions, creating bias from expectations. Publication bias favors positive results. Research primarily focused on white, higher-income populations, limiting broader applicability. Studies often failed to account for contextual factors beyond physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No authors received funding for this work. They reported no financial relationships with companies that would benefit from the research. One author previously worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but findings represent only the authors’ views.&lt;/p&gt;

While dietitians stress that whole foods are best, Cording says you don’t need to freak if you grab the odd bar to tide you over until dinner. “It’s really the overall diet pattern that matters,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you’d prefer to cut out or cut down on UPFs in your life, Gans recommends filling your plate with whole foods first. “Focus on eating more whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins, which naturally leave less room for ultra-processed ones,” she says. Reading ingredients lists is also helpful, Gans adds. “Look for lengthy lists that include added sugars, saturated fats, and excessive sodium,” she suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The experts also know that it's difficult to be perfect here. “You don’t have to cut everything out, but being mindful helps,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, scientists stumbled upon a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness, the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z"&gt;most common cause of hair loss&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583821/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on a sugar that naturally occurs in the body and helps form DNA: the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt;' part of deoxyribonucleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying how these sugars &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222111437"&gt;heal the wounds of mice&lt;/a&gt; when applied topically, scientists at the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University in Pakistan noticed that the fur around the lesions was growing back faster than in untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, the team decided to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in June 2024, they took male mice with testosterone-driven hair loss and removed the fur from their backs. Each day, researchers smeared a small dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt; sugar gel on the exposed skin, and within weeks, the fur in this region showed 'robust' regrowth, sprouting long, thick individual hairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deoxyribose gel was so effective, the team found it worked just as well as minoxidil, a topical treatment for hair loss commonly known by the brand name Rogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth," &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/cure-male-pattern-baldness-given-boost-sugar-discovery"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; tissue engineer Sheila MacNeil from the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protein-that-calms-waking-hair-follicles-could-lead-to-alopecia-treatment?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Protein That Calms Waking Hair Follicles Could Lead to Alopecia Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenic alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, is a natural condition caused by genetics, hormone levels, and aging, and it presents differently in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg" alt="male pattern baldness" class="wp-image-155531 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness presents differently in men and women.

It's not yet approved for female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finasteride can slow hair loss in about &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-loss/treatment/male-pattern-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;80 to 90 percent of male patients&lt;/a&gt;, but it needs to be taken continuously once it is started. The drug can be associated with unwanted, sometimes severe &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/medicines/c8584165-82ab-4a0f-8b3c-a53300ff8b32-reduced.pdf"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, such as erectile dysfunction, testicular or breast pain, reduced libido, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="167110" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment of androgenetic alopecia remains challenging," MacNeil and her colleagues, led by biomaterial researcher Muhammad Anjum from COMSATS, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the team designed a biodegradable, non-toxic gel made from deoxyribose, and applied the treatment to mouse models of male-pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minoxidil was also tested on balding mouse models, and some of the animals received a dose of both sugar gel &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; minoxidil for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to mice that received a gel without any medicine, those that received a gel with deoxyribose sugar began to sprout new hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both minoxidil and the sugar gel promoted 80 to 90 percent hair regrowth in mice with male pattern baldness.

It sets off a metabolic switch that floods the bloodstream with ketone bodies, small fat‑derived molecules that the brain eagerly soaks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest evidence traces how the primary ketone &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-46776-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;β‑hydroxybutyrate&lt;/a&gt; clings to misfolded proteins and steers them toward the cell’s waste‑recycling system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/lab/newman-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. John Newman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/a&gt; for Research on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ketone-bodies-and-the-brain"&gt;Ketone bodies and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glucose runs low the liver converts stored fat into β‑hydroxybutyrate and its cousins. Within hours blood levels can climb past 3 millimoles per liter, a range the mice in Newman’s lab hit during a week of ketone‑ester dosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that concentration the ketone slips across the blood‑brain barrier and begins attaching to proteins that have lost their shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfolded &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-high-protein-fruit-prunes-strengthens-muscles-and-bones-in-people-over-45/"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; are sticky; they jam up cellular machinery like lint in a dryer. By binding to them early β‑hydroxybutyrate lowers their solubility, flagging them for removal through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33233502/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10634967/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ketone bodies&lt;/a&gt; interact with damaged and misfolded proteins directly, making them insoluble so they can be pulled from the cell and recycled,” noted Dr. Newman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ketone-behind-the-brain-cleanup"&gt;The ketone behind the brain cleanup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemically, β‑hydroxybutyrate is a four‑carbon molecule with a lone &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/hydroxyl-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hydroxyl group&lt;/a&gt; sitting two atoms away from its acid tail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That subtle tweak lets it wedge into protein folds without forming permanent bonds, a trick confirmed when a non‑reactive alcohol analog failed to trigger the same protein drop‑out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mass‑spectrometry screens the team catalogued almost 300 proteins that shifted from soluble to insoluble, many bearing tubulin‑like domains that give neurons their internal scaffolding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those struts often falter first in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, so forcing the damaged pieces out early could head off later trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cell handled the overload well. Within two days of sustained ketosis the dirtiest aggregates were gone, suggesting that the janitorial burst is brief but powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experiments-in-mice-that-remember"&gt;Experiments in mice that remember&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test real‑world impact the researchers fed a ketone‑ester drink to 20‑month‑old mice, roughly the rodent equivalent of a 65‑year‑old human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treated animals cut their brain amyloid load and showed sharper performance in maze tasks compared with oil‑fed controls, echoing earlier work in transgenic Alzheimer rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood β‑hydroxybutyrate peaked near 4 millimoles per liter and drifted down within four hours, yet the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-model-esm3-creates-new-protein-that-simulates-500-million-years-of-biological-evolution/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;‑cleanup signature persisted, hinting at a lasting reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once they were treated with ketone bodies the animals recovered their ability to swim,” said doctoral researcher &lt;a href="https://sebastopolrotary.com/speakers/4e1baab0-9bd3-4f6d-80c5-d7a645b35738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sidharth Madhavan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, nematode worms &lt;a href="https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpet.35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; engineered to produce human &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459119/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid‑β&lt;/a&gt; regained their wiggling strength after swimming in ketone‑spiked media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cross‑species results point to a mechanic that works on core cell chemistry, not on quirks of one model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-hints-in-human-studies"&gt;Early hints in human studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans do not need engineered worms or maze trials to reach ketosis; an overnight fast or a &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ketogenic breakfast shake&lt;/a&gt; can raise blood ketones above 1 millimole per liter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a six‑month randomized trial a medium‑chain triglyceride drink that generated similar ketone levels improved episodic memory in people with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging from a companion &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8596139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that ketones bypassed sluggish glucose uptake and restored white‑matter energy use. While small, these findings back the idea that alternative fuel can do more than fill a calorie gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-everyday-eaters"&gt;What this means for everyday eaters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody is prescribing full‑time ketogenic diets yet, but brief fasts, time‑restricted eating, or exogenous ketone drinks are being tested as practical ways to spark the same cleanup pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians caution that ketosis is not for everyone, especially people managing insulin‑dependent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-type-of-diabetes-type-5-is-now-officially-recognized-linked-to-nutritional-deficiencies/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, yet most healthy adults can safely visit mild ketosis for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even endurance athletes, who traditionally favor carbohydrate loading, now experiment with ketone esters between sessions to speed brain recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future trials confirm &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meat-protein-boosts-survival-but-plants-boost-longevity/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; clearance in humans, weekend fasting or a morning ketone shot could become part of standard brain hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safer-brain-aging-with-ketone-bodies"&gt;Safer brain aging with ketone bodies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buck team is already screening related metabolites to see whether some outperform β‑hydroxybutyrate without the metallic taste or digestive side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also mapping which brain cells benefit most, because clearing toxic proteins in astrocytes may relieve different symptoms than doing so in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the discovery widens the lens on how metabolism shapes brain destiny. As life spans lengthen, a simple molecule that exercises the cell’s garbage disposal on command might help minds stay clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-chemical-biology/fulltext/S2451-9456(24)00459-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Chemical Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:39:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOYkR5ZVFEc29ub0VJOW9EdElqcHRHdWp4VUM3VTlCMHZfNVBLdl9IcE9icXBReV9DZlJrVlF0OWVaSGdmcDhZZmxhem5ESnV4Ym1QWkVKNUJfR3dGVm0wYmFqV080MlpFenJ3UmZ0VnRZYjFSZXJtdHpYNjRGbGdLM1RId0E2ZmVZWTJqcm9SWmdaM2hteFRSZ3lEd2E</guid></item><item><title>您的排便时间表对您的整体健康有很大影响，建议您进行研究- ScienceAlert | Your Poop Schedule Says a Lot About Your Overall Health, Suggests Study - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPVGp5QzQtV3pjbDlpZTJBQ1NkTkdwbGowMnVEWTFNUkV4RWJMR1kwQ3VQNndPWk5obFl1U3djZkFMMGNLZFF1LVJSRS1lRXI3Umc3UEFjcy11RVppaHltQkIyZXhUVmdPZXFCYTBud3NsdGhUcENlSXFXTjB5VExPbnZOWkhDWEx6T2poa3RjcjZheGdlZ09GSE1HMGgtenVT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"How often do you poop?" might sound like a very personal question, but your answer could reveal quite a lot about your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in July 2024 investigated how often 1,425 people went number two, and compared those stats to their demographic, genetic, and health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping too often or too rarely were both associated with different underlying health issues, while the healthiest participants reported pooping once or twice a day – a 'Goldilocks zone' of bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows how bowel movement frequency can influence all body systems, and how aberrant bowel movement frequency may be an important risk factor in the development of chronic diseases," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Washington microbiologist Sean Gibbons, the corresponding author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-poop-may-predict-an-imminent-death?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Something in Your Poop May Predict an Imminent Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform strategies for managing bowel movement frequency, even in healthy populations, to optimize health and wellness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by a team from the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), investigated the bathroom habits of people who were "generally healthy" – that is, with no history of kidney or gut issues like kidney disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al.,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants self-reported how often they dropped the kids off at the pool, and the researchers organized them into four categories: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-constipation-could-be-having-a-serious-impact-on-your-heart"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; for those reporting one or two bowel movements per week; low-normal for three to six movements per week; high-normal for one to three movements per day; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; for four or more watery stools per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed patients' blood metabolites and chemistry, their genetics, and the gut microbes present in their stool samples. The team then looked for possible associations between bowel movement frequency and these health markers, as well as other factors like their age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, those who reported less frequent bowel movements tended to be women, younger, and with a lower body mass index (BMI). But even accounting for these factors, people with constipation or diarrhea showed clear links to underlying health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria usually found in the upper gastrointestinal tract were more common in stool samples from participants with diarrhea. Their blood samples, meanwhile, showed biomarkers associated with liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stool samples from people with less frequent bowel movements had higher levels of bacteria associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201100542"&gt;protein fermentation&lt;/a&gt;. This is a known hazard from constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If stool sticks around too long in the gut, microbes use up all of the available dietary fiber, which they ferment into beneficial short-chain fatty acids. After that, the ecosystem switches to fermentation of proteins, which produces several toxins that can make their way into the bloodstream," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Johannes Johnson-Martinez, a bioengineer at ISB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, some of these byproducts were found in these patients' blood samples. Particularly enriched was a metabolite called indoxyl-sulfate, a known product of protein fermentation which can damage the kidneys. The team suggests this is potential evidence of a causal link between bowel movement frequency and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some hope that people can change their habits and as a result, their health. Those in the Goldilocks zone of pooping reported eating more fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-lists-health-benefits-of-drinking-more-water-each-day"&gt;drinking more water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pooping-before-you-exercise-has-an-incredible-effect-on-performance"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt;. Their stool samples showed high levels of bacteria associated with fermenting fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everybody's found themselves at one extreme or the other at some point in their lives, after catching a stomach bug or eating too much cheese. But this study was looking more at people's everyday routine, and how our own version of 'normal' could hint at health issues we weren't aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101646"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of relying on radiation or chemicals, scientists now use finely tuned molecules that vibrate as one unit to tear open cancer cells. These molecules, known as molecular jackhammers, offer a non-invasive and highly effective way to kill tumors from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that activating these molecules with near-infrared light sets off whole-molecule vibrations. These vibrations are powerful enough to destroy the membrane of a cancer cell, leading to necrosis—the rapid death of the cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method doesn’t rely on heat or &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-portable-testing-device-rapidly-detects-hiv-and-covid-19-with-high-accuracy/"&gt;chemical reactions&lt;/a&gt;, so it's not slowed down or blocked by the body’s natural defenses like reactive oxygen species inhibitors. That makes it a game-changer for therapies that usually face resistance or fail to reach deep tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Ciceron Ayala-Orozco is a research scientist in the Tour lab at Rice University, and lead author on the study.

They barely penetrate past a millimeter into tissues like skin or muscle. In contrast, near-infrared light can pass through up to 10 centimeters, or about 4 inches. This range makes it ideal for reaching tumors that lie deep beneath the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared light falls within the “optical therapeutic window,” meaning it doesn’t get absorbed as easily by blood or water in the body. This quality allows doctors to deliver targeted energy without harming nearby tissues. Unlike ultraviolet light, it’s safe and effective for in-body treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method developed by scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; and partners involves aminocyanines, a class of dye molecules long used in medical imaging. These molecules attach themselves to the outer membrane of cells. When exposed to NIR light, they vibrate across their entire structure—a process called vibronic-driven action (VDA). This mechanical action punches holes in the cell membrane, killing the cell quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_molecular_jackhammers_are_so_effective"&gt;Why Molecular Jackhammers Are So Effective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules work by creating whole-body molecular vibrations that resonate at subpicosecond speeds—less than one trillionth of a second. Instead of shaking apart just one part of a molecule, the entire structure moves in sync. This “ultrafast breathing mode” is what makes them lethal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon that drives this action is called vibronic coupling. It combines electronic oscillations (plasmons) and atomic vibrations (phonons) into one hybrid movement. This interaction spreads energy evenly throughout the molecule, which leads to a powerful, unified strike against the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/powerful-new-protein-effectively-delivers-cancer-fighting-drugs-directly-into-cells/"&gt;cell membrane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, these molecules wiped out 99% of human melanoma cells grown in dishes. In mouse models, half of the animals treated with this approach had complete remission of their tumors. This level of success marks a big leap forward for cancer therapies that often struggle with resistance and incomplete tumor elimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;James Tour is the T.

Feringa-type motors, for example, are designed to spin like drills when hit with UV or visible light. These molecules have been used to poke holes in cell membranes, but they spin much slower and can’t operate under NIR light. They also don’t travel as deep into tissue, which limits their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other molecules known as Dube hemithioindigo switches can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to cell death. But ROS-based methods can be neutralized by the body’s &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-enzymes-offer-breakthrough-in-genetic-editing-beyond-crispr/"&gt;natural enzymes&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the slower rotation speed of these switches isn’t enough to physically disrupt cells like the jackhammers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new method uses light at lower intensity—just 80 milliwatts per square centimeter for 2.5 minutes—and still achieves complete cell destruction. That’s 10 to 50 times less power than what’s used in photothermal and photodynamic therapies. And the aminocyanine molecules are effective at doses as low as 500 nanomoles per liter, a concentration much lower than what’s typically required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These properties make molecular jackhammers not only more powerful but also safer and more &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-is-substantially-more-energy-efficient-thanks-to-groundbreaking-new-device/"&gt;energy-efficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Their method utilizes molecular vibrations triggered by near-infrared light to destroy cancerous cells with remarkable efficiency.

It’s a physical attack that cells can’t resist or adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Ciceron Ayala-Orozco described how the molecules were designed to cling to the lipid bilayer—the outer coating of the cell. Their structure makes it easy for them to anchor in place and deliver their vibrating punch exactly where it’s needed. He saw potential in using plasmons not just for imaging or sensing but as active agents in killing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study these effects more deeply, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; used simulations to understand how the energy flowed through the molecule. They confirmed that the oscillations occurred fast and in harmony, supporting the mechanical destruction of the cell membrane. Meanwhile, mouse studies took place at &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of Dr. Jeffrey Myers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this technique unique is its departure from traditional mechanisms. It doesn’t rely on heat, chemicals, or radiation. Instead, it uses motion at the molecular level—movement so fast and so precise that cancer cells stand no chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Interactive two-person fNIRS neuroimaging setup from NIRx Medical Technologies.

Already, NIR light is being used in several advanced techniques that go far beyond &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/digital-triage-tool-significantly-reduces-cancer-treatment-time/"&gt;cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fast-growing field is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive brain scan tracks blood flow to measure brain activity. It’s especially useful for newborns or patients with epilepsy or stroke, where traditional scans may be risky or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is another promising area. It uses NIR light to reduce inflammation, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/two-promising-new-drugs-could-be-the-cure-for-chronic-lower-back-pain/"&gt;manage pain&lt;/a&gt;, and speed up wound healing. This therapy is particularly useful for treating chronic conditions and speeding recovery in sports injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are also using NIR light in imaging systems during surgery. Special dyes light up cancerous tissue so surgeons can remove tumors more precisely. Some probes even respond to specific proteins, making it easier to target hard-to-see cancers without harming healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Regional Oximetry uses near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to enable monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) for cerebral and somatic monitoring sites.

Tiny particles or gels can be designed to release medicine only when exposed to NIR light. This method allows for precise control, getting medicine where it’s needed without affecting the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_future_of_vibration_based_cancer_therapies"&gt;The Future of Vibration-Based Cancer Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from Rice University and its collaborators signal a shift in how cancer might be treated in the future. By focusing on mechanical forces rather than chemicals or heat, researchers can bypass many of the defenses that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-proton-beam-therapy-precisely-targets-and-destroys-cancer-cells/"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; use to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecular jackhammer concept takes advantage of simple, safe materials and pairs them with the deep reach of NIR light. Its success in both lab and animal models shows it could be ready for larger trials soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just a scientific breakthrough, this approach represents a new way of thinking about medical treatment—one that combines physics, chemistry, and biology into a unified assault on disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ayala-Orozco noted, the goal wasn’t just to vibrate molecules for fun. It was to turn that energy into something useful. And in this case, it was used to destroy one of the most resilient enemies of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPb01vWHpQVXVSdFBXQlg5blVYSWdfd2ZKVnRVUUpHcDQ3SlY5SFFKWjdNSWZoa0EtemJac0ZhX0RiQUFzWTdib1BrOWR4bThLNUxZUExVTmx6OGFqTldSVk53ZEFkS2xKWFVWQ1pvSlVRS1pnYjRvT2VtQUcwcHh6RkVaRFpIelR5di1FVExYN1lEd0FCOUV5ejNRQkJOb2dvMnRSUWdray1iMVIzMk8yTF9SWQ</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例达到自2000年从美国消灭以来的最高点- NBC新闻 | Measles cases reach highest point since the disease was eliminated from U.S. in 2000 - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPb1VQRDNUMFV6QlAwaGRxQlhvNUczM0s5SFQ1MzZjS05xT0x4TVdXMWNjSXByNElsUnM4dWdKRURIR1gwMi1LT3U4N05EN2lQOWtlZ2dYaVlYblppY1RLYkJYbEFueGtvZUQzeDFWZlBrWmUzUEREOFhYTEdPZ01EcVluUE9rNnk5SGtwVWpoc29DblozQ2JQTDVsZEpqWVZiNUhkZEoxV0ZEUG40RjNmNkRLeXB3bnV2emfSAVZBVV95cUxPV1N2RjZlUmVBdk1KS0J5WU01YTd6RFgxSVBuVWZkN001OFhicDhYN0RxRFdqM1RPVmx5bGoyM2RlY0wzRDlub0d5RG4tMFVDZGo4QnpsQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles cases in the United States are the highest they’ve been since the country eliminated the disease in 2000. The U.S. has reported 1,277 cases since the start of the year, according to NBC News’ tally of state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this year, the U.S. also recorded its first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles deaths&lt;/a&gt; in a decade: two children in Texas and an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. All were unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the past 25 years, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. because it has not continuously spread over a year-long period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are still periodic outbreaks, however, including one that took off in in a Mennonite community in West Texas earlier this year. Vaccination rates in Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, are particularly low: As of the 2023-24 school year, 82% of kindergarteners in the county had received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine, far below the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;95% rate needed to curb spread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a meeting of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee in April that measles would have to keep spreading through January 20 of next year for the U.S. to lose its elimination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the cases so far this year are linked to the Southwest outbreak — there have been more than 700 cases in Texas alone — though a number of smaller outbreaks, resulting from international travel, have been detected across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; The resurgence of measles can be attributed, in part, to declining vaccination rates both globally and nationally. During the 2023-24 school year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm?s_cid=mm7341a3_w" target="_blank"&gt;less than 93% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. received the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine, down from 95% during the 2019-20 school year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The West Texas outbreak parallels one in 2019 among &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Orthodox Jewish communities in New York&lt;/a&gt; with low vaccination rates. The U.S. recorded 1,274 cases that year. A vaccination campaign, which included a vaccine mandate in New York City and officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;administering 60,000 doses&lt;/a&gt; in affected communities, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;helped contain the spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New York’s response was “an incredible feat and something we’re obviously trying to emulate,” Sugerman said. But he noted that the loss of Covid grant money has created “funding limitations” in Texas. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding&lt;/a&gt; last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which “adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many disease experts have also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;expressed concern that the federal messaging&lt;/a&gt; around vaccines could make the outbreak harder to contain. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has also framed vaccination as a personal choice, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; like steroids or antibiotics and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;falsely claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician who treats patients in Lubbock and Gaines County, said at a press conference in April that misinformation was the “biggest nemesis” for healthcare providers. She was aware of some patients taking vitamin A instead of getting vaccinated, she said. Kennedy has played up the role of vitamin A in helping measles patients, though &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank"&gt;it’s unclear how beneficial it is&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC says vitamin A can be administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider, but it’s not a treatment for the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Countering the misinformation put out there about using vitamin A for treatment of measles has been a struggle, an upward struggle,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By contrast, two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and offer lifelong protection. The virus is particularly dangerous for babies and young children, whose immune systems aren’t always developed enough to fight an infection. In Texas, officials recommended an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-vaccine-effort-parents-babies-rcna207819" target="_blank"&gt;early dose for babies ages 6 to 11 months&lt;/a&gt;. Unvaccinated children over 12 months old should get one dose, according to the state, then a second dose 28 days later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles often starts with a high fever, cough, runny nose and pink or watery eyes. From there, people may develop white spots on the insides of the cheeks near the molars and a blotchy rash of flat, red spots. Severe cases can progress to pneumonia or swelling of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPb1VQRDNUMFV6QlAwaGRxQlhvNUczM0s5SFQ1MzZjS05xT0x4TVdXMWNjSXByNElsUnM4dWdKRURIR1gwMi1LT3U4N05EN2lQOWtlZ2dYaVlYblppY1RLYkJYbEFueGtvZUQzeDFWZlBrWmUzUEREOFhYTEdPZ01EcVluUE9rNnk5SGtwVWpoc29DblozQ2JQTDVsZEpqWVZiNUhkZEoxV0ZEUG40RjNmNkRLeXB3bnV2emfSAVZBVV95cUxPV1N2RjZlUmVBdk1KS0J5WU01YTd6RFgxSVBuVWZkN001OFhicDhYN0RxRFdqM1RPVmx5bGoyM2RlY0wzRDlub0d5RG4tMFVDZGo4QnpsQQ</guid></item><item><title>Mounjaro用户对奇怪的副作用引发明显的体重增加感到震惊： “感觉就像我在扩张” -每日邮报 | Mounjaro users horrified as bizarre side effect triggers apparent weight GAIN: 'feels like I'm expanding' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdWYxQ08tM19LNTFZWl84bjlsUm9VUm43bnpJdURrTUlpN3BtcTk1T1lQNDV5SklPdm9tZDdFLUFfTGs5QVVIX00tR3hjTUhEQW9LeVllUzJJaUIwRVI0TG9xWU9UTXQ2eUJGVE1oYl9jbm4zWEQzRHZxVXB1aGt6SHc2MFlMa3A4ek9iMHlwT1p2UWxtQmtlRjk1a3RtZ195WHZZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9GT1JGNWo3SVZCVFVYSE1LbzQ1bW5mc3NQamZDcXZBMzlyNV9ELWhQUjJKMjg3RThEaWRkR0w2X1BqN1JZZHlOczVxcVdjOVZHWXI5N2JkNmk0RUdpNVRCYzNVS2FXZllyUml1UF9famI2bkJ5dHdRX0hMTFFPQ0hVc2RTNFZPRFNrZW9aU3l3MlJ2QVQxdjhxMFJZYkRHem9sWmRzRmNwcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-three who shed two stone in just nine weeks by using weight loss injections has warned other users of a painful side-effect—which has left her looking bigger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once aimed at &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-cad313e0-5be3-11f0-9818-43978d934320"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; patients, Mounjaro has been dubbed the 'King Kong' of skinny jabs, bringing about rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cadcfef0-5be3-11f0-9818-43978d934320"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by reducing appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the injections often come with side effects including severe bloating, nausea, diarrhoea and in some severe cases, life-threatening organ damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayleigh, 37,  from Kent, weighed over 19 stone (120kg) and dropped to around 17 stone (107kg) within just nine weeks of taking Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs, which can now be prescribed by GPs free of charge in England, initially vastly improved Kayleigh's relationship with her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she shared shocking images taken before and after her weekly dose which reveals she suffers from extreme bloating—causing her stomach to balloon to more than double its normal size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The photos, taken just 24 hours apart after taking a 5mg dosage of the medication, show Kayleigh clutching her abdomen, which looks swollen and very painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-three shared the agonising side-effect with her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kleelin2/video/7521755316015435030?is_from_webapp=1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;web_id=7494180809390786070"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers, adding that the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14609885/GP-persistent-bloating-sign-deadly-cancer.html"&gt;bloating &lt;/a&gt;is usually accompanied with vomiting and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kayleigh shared her symptoms with her 6,000 TikTok followers, saying that she suffers painful bloating every time she takes the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The jabs spur weight loss by mimicking the actions of hormone GLP-1, which is naturally released in the gut after eating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other jabbers flooded her post with support and tips, with some complaining of similar symptoms, whilst others suggested it could be caused by slower digestion triggered by the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commented: 'Any time I eat something it's like I'm pumped up!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Every meal I eat my stomach swells like a balloon too.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection, like other weight loss jabs such as Ozempic and WeGovy, works by mimicking the actions of a hormone released in the gut after eating, called GLP-1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as signaling the pancreas to produce more insulin, Mounjaro disrupts signals between the gut and brain, keeping users fuller for longer and delays the stomach from being emptied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14860347/bizarre-effect-weight-loss-jabs-drunk-alcohol-reddit.html"&gt; Professor Penny Wad,&lt;/a&gt; a pharmaceutical experts at King's College London, this alone could be enough to trigger painful bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Delayed stomach emptying might delay the transit of carbohydrate through the gut,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This gives certain foods more time to produce gas in the intestine, through gut bacteria digesting and fermenting them—causing painful bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating can also be caused by various medical conditions such as IBS, Crohn's disease and small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (SIBO), which occurs when there is an abnormal increase in the amount of bacteria in the small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside bloating these conditions can also cause other distressing digestive issues, such as cramps, diarrhoea, nausea and blood in the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alongside the bloating, which usually happens around 24hours after taking the jab, Kayleigh also experiences nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea - common side-effects of the blockbuster jabs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayleigh told her followers that her bloating is reduced by taking Wellgard probiotics which support digestion and bowel regulation by boosting the number of healthy bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, bloating is not the only adverse side-effect experienced by Mounjaro users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the UK medicines regulator launched a probe into the safety of fat jabs, after hundreds of users developed pancreatitis, leaving ten dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it has received more than 560 reports of people developing an inflamed pancreas after taking the jabs since they were first launched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects such as these continue to be a significant burden on the NHS and studies have shown they account for one in six hospital admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is predicted that adverse drug reactions could cost the NHS more than £2.2 billion a year in hospital stays alone, Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These blockbuster jabs have also been credited with lowering blood sugar levels for people with type 2 diabetes, but experts have warned they are not a silver bullet and can come with a number of serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a sobering report suggested Britain's spiraling obesity levels—which costs the economy around £75billion a year—have fuelled a staggering 39 per cent rise in type 2 diabetes among people under 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kayleigh has lost two stone on the medication &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent estimates suggest that about 1.5 million people in the UK are taking weight loss jabs, which can help users lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the numbers using them privately where it costs around £250 a month are even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as severely obese patients in England with a BMI over 40 and at least four obesity-related health conditions such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14838139/GPs-dish-King-Kong-weight-loss-jab-Mounjaro-TODAY-free-NHS-YOU-qualify.html"&gt;will be offered Mounjaro &lt;/a&gt;free of charge from their GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The weekly injection will be offered to around 220,000 people over the next three years under new NHS prescribing rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within 12 years, around for million Britons are expected to be receiving the jabs on the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, like any drug, side effects are wide-ranging and include issues like nausea and abdominal pain as well as digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:43:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdWYxQ08tM19LNTFZWl84bjlsUm9VUm43bnpJdURrTUlpN3BtcTk1T1lQNDV5SklPdm9tZDdFLUFfTGs5QVVIX00tR3hjTUhEQW9LeVllUzJJaUIwRVI0TG9xWU9UTXQ2eUJGVE1oYl9jbm4zWEQzRHZxVXB1aGt6SHc2MFlMa3A4ek9iMHlwT1p2UWxtQmtlRjk1a3RtZ195WHZZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9GT1JGNWo3SVZCVFVYSE1LbzQ1bW5mc3NQamZDcXZBMzlyNV9ELWhQUjJKMjg3RThEaWRkR0w2X1BqN1JZZHlOczVxcVdjOVZHWXI5N2JkNmk0RUdpNVRCYzNVS2FXZllyUml1UF9famI2bkJ5dHdRX0hMTFFPQ0hVc2RTNFZPRFNrZW9aU3l3MlJ2QVQxdjhxMFJZYkRHem9sWmRzRmNwcg</guid></item><item><title>运动健康专家揭穿了一个60岁的神话：每天都做不一定能保证身体健康-《银河日报》 | Sports Health Expert Debunks a 60-Year-Old Myth: Doing It Every Day Is Not Necessarily a Guarantee of Good Health - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxOeDhvS0xwSURoOVdVOHQyTGlGTXNkQ1BJcUIyYTNOLW1CVlExWlUyWUxUZXZjOGZMZUwwdTc3cG1NbDdpWXg3dUczNnRHZXpnUmhFZW1Wd2pVUnZYV2VsZVFPTjVXSmQ1R0I4NFo2SDN3R2d1eUNpNFVMZ0lVSE9BcVhWdFJ5X3BJdC1VSl9rSjIxYmwtQTlHYV9IaGxKSThZVmYxbk55TkJFMXhoa0dxMXZuRG54eFRzc0M0ZzJSdWtXM296VEY5MEpkclhOSWRlNzRXX0dCazdYQWprRmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever purchased a fitness tracker or been on a health kick, chances are you’ve encountered the recommendation to walk &lt;strong&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s become a &lt;strong&gt;fitness benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;, widely endorsed by health experts, devices, and apps alike. But is it actually necessary for good health? Despite being deeply ingrained in popular culture, the 10,000-steps rule might not be as critical as it seems. Recent findings have challenged this conventional wisdom, with experts suggesting that walking less—when done correctly—can still deliver &lt;strong&gt;significant health benefits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Origins of the 10,000-Steps Myth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the &lt;strong&gt;10,000-steps figure&lt;/strong&gt; didn’t come from extensive scientific research but rather a clever &lt;strong&gt;marketing strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. In the 1960s, a &lt;strong&gt;Japanese company&lt;/strong&gt; introduced a pedometer called the “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” which roughly translates to “&lt;strong&gt;10,000 steps meter&lt;/strong&gt;.” This number wasn’t backed by any health studies but was used as a simple, catchy goal to encourage people to move more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s marketing campaign was highly effective, and it helped embed the 10,000-step idea into public health narratives worldwide. Today, the recommendation still persists despite the lack of hard evidence proving that it’s the &lt;strong&gt;magic number&lt;/strong&gt; for good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Walking: A Healthier Habit Than We Think&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its origins, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/if-you-like-walking-elon-musk-is-willing-to-pay-you-8000-a-month-to-do-it-at-tesla/" data-type="post" data-id="77614"&gt;walking &lt;/a&gt;does indeed have significant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/coffee-and-gut-health-what-researchers-just-discovered-about-your-health/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73233" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—whether you reach 10,000 steps or not. Health experts, including sports physician &lt;strong&gt;Christian Daulouède&lt;/strong&gt; from Bordeaux, are now emphasizing that the true benefits of walking come from its &lt;strong&gt;intensity&lt;/strong&gt; rather than the sheer number of steps. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daulouède points out that a brisk &lt;strong&gt;4-kilometer walk&lt;/strong&gt; is likely to be more beneficial for cardiovascular health than a leisurely stroll &lt;strong&gt;over 7 kilometers&lt;/strong&gt;. “10,000 steps without a fast pace is not the same as 10,000 steps with brisk walking,” Daulouède explains. The emphasis, he argues, should be on the &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt; of the walk, not the quantity of steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Real Health Benefits of Walking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking isn’t just a low-impact workout; it’s a powerful tool for both physical and &lt;strong&gt;mental well-being&lt;/strong&gt;. Experts, like certified personal trainer &lt;strong&gt;Natalya Vasquez&lt;/strong&gt;, note that walking can help reduce the risk of &lt;strong&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/strong&gt; such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Studies have even shown that walking &lt;strong&gt;7,000 to 8,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt; a day may be enough to lower the risk of these conditions significantly. Additionally, walking promotes &lt;strong&gt;muscle strength&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in the lower body, and can alleviate issues like lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Another crucial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/what-walking-speed-says-about-personality/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76477" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefit of walking &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is its positive impact on &lt;strong&gt;mental health&lt;/strong&gt;. Walking regularly can help alleviate stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. The act of walking releases &lt;strong&gt;endorphins&lt;/strong&gt; and serotonin, hormones known to improve mood and overall emotional well-being. Whether it’s a brisk walk in the park or a stroll around the block, walking provides an easy, accessible way to boost mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Many Steps Should You Really Aim For?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While 10,000 steps might seem like the go-to goal, research suggests that a &lt;strong&gt;lower target&lt;/strong&gt; can still be incredibly effective. A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/10/231026131551.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2023 study from the University of Granada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; found that walking &lt;strong&gt;7,000 to 8,000 steps a day&lt;/strong&gt; offers a sweet spot for improving health outcomes, particularly for reducing the risk of premature death and chronic disease. For those currently sedentary or beginning their fitness journey, experts recommend gradually increasing your daily steps by &lt;strong&gt;2,000 to 3,000&lt;/strong&gt; at a time, allowing your body to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, your &lt;strong&gt;walking pace&lt;/strong&gt; plays a pivotal role in how beneficial your walk is. Vasquez explains that the faster you walk, the more intense the exercise becomes, thereby boosting your cardiovascular health. In fact, walking briskly can be as effective as engaging in moderate to high-intensity &lt;strong&gt;cardio exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal should be to find a sustainable, consistent routine that suits your physical ability and lifestyle—rather than obsessing over hitting a specific step count.&lt;/p&gt;

From running freely in the backyard to having a heartfelt breakfast, the fur baby shows how he spends his day at his grandparents’ house. Aside from his adorable behavior, the clip also gains attention for the funny voiceover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Instagram video shows what a Golden Retriever puppy does on his visit to grandparents’ home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an Instagram video, an owner captures their Golden Retriever puppy Handsome’s day when the latter visits his grandparents’ home. The uploader adds a voiceover, which explains what the pooch does at his favorite place. Meanwhile, the caption reads, “Favorite grand child status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video begins with Handsome introducing himself and informing that he will show his day at his grandma’s place. As he roams around inside the house with an attitude, the pooch then settles down for his breakfast. The voiceover, expressing the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-toddler-reunion-video-064720789.html" data-ylk="slk:dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;’s thoughts, claims that he has to eat to avoid “bloating since it is swimsuit szn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The puppy runs outside on the grass but claims it is his “least favorite part of” the day. Handsome seems to prefer lying under a shade as he is spotted under various trees, stating that he wants to prevent “wrinkles” and “spots.” Then, the pooch shows his eagerness to come inside to avoid the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the next scene, the dog is in a crate in a moving vehicle, revealing that he is now going to visit “Grandpa and Grandma Jan’s house.” He is worried because his mom said that grandpa is not fond of dog hair. Despite the warning, the pup runs around the house and also tries to befriend a pet cat.

SNAP is a lifeline for many individuals, families and people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 62% of SNAP recipients are part of families with children. In 2022, 20% of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/food-stamps-and-family-snap-recipients-by-family-structure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:children under 18;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;children under 18&lt;/a&gt; nationwide were in families receiving SNAP benefits. More than 38% of SNAP recipients are from working families. And more than 37% of families receiving SNAP include someone who is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Alabama" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disabled or elderly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;disabled or elderly&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CBPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Without SNAP, families miss meals. Kids show up to school hungry. Parents skip groceries to keep the lights on. We’re not talking about convenience. We’re talking about survival,” Erica Williams, executive director of the nonprofit &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="http://www.aredcircle.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Red Circle;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;A Red Circle&lt;/a&gt; and co-author of the peer-reviewed food policy brief &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/1349" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food Pricing and Consumer Choice;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Food Pricing and Consumer Choice&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo. SNAP is crucial because “it’s the most direct tool we have to reduce hunger,” she says. Most of the families Williams works with tell her that they don’t want to be on SNAP forever but need help while they “get stable,” she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SNAP can be used to buy &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a variety of foods;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;a variety of foods&lt;/a&gt;, including dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables and snack foods. However, the program has limitations. “You can’t buy hot food or household goods like soap and diapers,” Williams says. “You also can’t buy prepared meals, which means parents working two jobs can’t just grab something healthy on the go. It reinforces exhaustion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although SNAP helps many people get by when they don’t earn enough to buy groceries, it often isn’t enough. Rising food costs and eligibility restrictions make it challenging for many SNAP recipients to meet their needs. Yahoo talked to five people about what being on SNAP is really like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="were-both-trying-but-were-still-hungry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'We’re both trying. But we’re still hungry.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle, a single mother in Missouri, works full-time in administrative support. She started receiving SNAP benefits when her son Marcus, now 20, was a baby, and his father stopped paying child support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, Danielle works 40 hours a week and still receives SNAP benefits. Marcus, who is neurodivergent, lives at home while he takes classes at a community college and works about 15 hours a week. Yet, despite having two working adults in the house, Danielle and Marcus don’t earn enough to feed themselves adequately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle’s SNAP benefits help, but they are still struggling. Marcus stopped receiving benefits when he turned 18 because he was in school full-time and wasn’t working enough hours to qualify for SNAP. Now, Danielle has to feed herself and her son with SNAP benefits meant for one adult. “I understand the rules,” Danielle tells Yahoo. However, she emphasizes that she’s unwilling to let her son go hungry or drop out of school and have a chance at a more financially stable life. “That means I skip meals so he doesn’t have to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle usually buys foods like dry pasta, rice and canned vegetables to stretch her grocery budget. Eggs are a rare luxury, and she relies on a nonprofit food bank for fresh produce. Most of Danielle and Marcus’s diet is “Heavy. Salty,” Marcus says. “You feel full, then you crash. I get foggy. Slow. Food’s supposed to be medicine,” Marcus tells Yahoo. However, his limited diet often makes him feel worse. “We’re both trying. But we’re still hungry,” Danielle says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle wants people to know that “this isn’t about laziness. It’s not about people gaming the system. It’s about working families, caregiving parents, students trying to get out and still falling short.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="snap-is-not-charity-its-a-stabilizing-force"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'SNAP is not charity. It’s a stabilizing force.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like Danielle, Jessica is also a single mother living in Missouri. She’s been on and off SNAP since 2012. She typically buys items like flour, cereal, cheese and salmon with her SNAP benefits. Occasionally, she buys fresh fruit and vegetables and treats like ice cream or chicken nuggets for her son. However, due to the higher cost of fruit and vegetables, Jessica often finds that her benefits aren’t enough to support a healthy diet. To fill the gap, Jessica relies on nonprofits like A Red Circle. “The biggest challenge of being on SNAP is finding affordable quality food,” Jessica tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though Jessica would like to feed her son a healthy diet, she laments that her SNAP benefits are often just enough to cover “pantry fillers.” Another challenge to staying healthy on SNAP is that "you can’t buy vitamins, medicine or supplements,” she says. That makes it harder to stay healthy in the long run, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, SNAP is a lifeline for Jessica. “Without SNAP, feeding my family would be incredibly hard. With the cost of living so high and wages so low, it would be a serious struggle,” she explains. “SNAP is not charity. It’s a stabilizing force,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-literally-wouldnt-be-surviving-without-snap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I literally wouldn't be surviving without SNAP'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan, who lives alone and has chronic Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, worked as a public servant in New York for 24 years. For her entire career, she helped others in need, including people struggling with mental illness and families whose loved ones were placed in child or adult protective services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although Megan wanted to continue working, her health worsened, and she had to leave her job. Once Megan’s savings ran out, she relied on local food pantries for food. When that wasn’t enough, she applied for SNAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan still visits food pantries. However, she uses her SNAP benefits to “round out meals from the ingredients the food pantry provides,” she says. Since Megan usually gets canned and boxed goods from the food pantry, she usually uses her SNAP benefits to buy meat and produce. However, she notes that because of the high price of fresh fruit, produce “feels like a luxury.” Moreover, although Megan tries to cook everything from scratch to save money, she keeps one or two pre-prepared meals on hand to eat when her illness flares and she’s too fatigued to cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I literally wouldn't be surviving without SNAP,” Megan tells Yahoo. “Having SNAP has given me some peace of mind regarding access to food.” However, Megan is concerned because SNAP benefits don’t automatically increase when &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-snap-benefits-arent-keeping-up-with-the-rising-cost-of-food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grocery prices;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;grocery prices&lt;/a&gt; go up. Due to rising grocery prices, “the SNAP benefits don't stretch as far in covering what's needed for a month,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan is doing what she can to help with her recovery, but doesn’t know when or if she will be able to return to work. “Every fiber of me just wants to have my prior level of functioning back,” she says. “I loved the work that I did. I loved my clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds: “I'm hopeful that I will medically improve enough to be able to return to work and discontinue SNAP, but it will realistically be a few years, at best.” Until then, “SNAP is a lifeline for me,” Megan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-would-have-had-a-hard-time-paying-for-my-essentials"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I would have had a hard time paying for my essentials.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ryan Wilson, a disabled videographer from Colorado, was on SNAP for seven years. Like &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-including-people-disabilities-workforce-133700705.html" data-ylk="slk:many people with disabilities;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;many people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, he had a hard time finding a job that paid him a living wage. “The job market was and is tough,” Wilson tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When he wasn’t earning enough to cover his basic expenses, SNAP helped him get by. He told Yahoo that without SNAP, “I would have had a hard time paying for my essentials” like food and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Wilson emphasizes that SNAP helped him survive but not thrive. When he was on SNAP, he couldn’t use his benefits to buy necessities other than food. Additionally, he could only use his benefits at select locations like big box stores, even though smaller grocery stores were often closer. “That is an inconvenience, especially for someone with a disability that impacts their mobility,” Wilson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now Wilson runs a video production company called &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://teamtrustproductions.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Team Trust Productions;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Team Trust Productions&lt;/a&gt;. His income has increased, and he no longer needs SNAP to ensure he can access enough food. Wilson is grateful he received SNAP when he needed it, but he never expected to receive SNAP benefits forever. “It's a temporary option. It does not have to be a permanent solution to financial uncertainty,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-would-definitely-not-be-eating-three-meals-a-day"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I would definitely not be eating three meals a day'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although Laura, a single woman from Pennsylvania, worked full-time, her income wasn’t enough to support herself. For three years, Laura received SNAP benefits to help her get by. Eventually, she started earning a higher salary and no longer needed SNAP to buy food. However, in early 2025, Laura lost her job. Once her unemployment benefits ran out, she started receiving SNAP benefits again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Without SNAP, “I would definitely not be eating three meals a day,” Laura tells Yahoo. She usually uses her SNAP benefits to buy frozen fruits and vegetables, chicken thighs and seasonal fruit and vegetables, which she finds more affordable than out-of-season produce. When she can afford it, Laura buys cheese and coffee. She also goes to her local food pantry to supplement her groceries. However, she emphasizes that food pantries are “meant to be just that — supplemental, not a source of regular groceries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura is grateful for the SNAP benefits she receives, but thinks some aspects of the program need to be changed. “I wish we could buy paper products,” she says. “Toilet paper is just as necessary as apples, and I wish I could just get everything at once.” She also wishes that restrictions on what SNAP recipients can buy, such as candy and hot foods, would be removed. Plus, Laura finds it difficult to figure out which foods she can buy with her benefits and which are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“No one should be told what food they're allowed to buy. Food is a human right,” Laura says. “By making laws that just blindly eliminate whole sections of foods, that just makes it harder on people with specific diets. Or, it makes it impossible to give a little kid a birthday party,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most importantly, Laura wishes she could rely on SNAP being around for those who need it. She’s still looking for a full-time job that pays enough for her to support herself. Until then, however, "it’s always in the back of my mind that my access to food could be taken away at any time. Depending on a program that's outside of your control, just to feed yourself, is terrifying,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 09:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxQcGhTRlMtYXFtZUlSRFpSdzQzcmxMSGxkMml0ZUxMZWFNVlRES0liZUNIakFQSTl5TEdOUEtxY3ZDNElfeHpLUVIzREptcDcwQkN1NUhzYXh0U3JUbFg1eFphb25JbnU3LXI4NHB3T3FZQjM0ak0xNFdqYU95cGg5RGEwb0ZiWHpRWUtwR280SzlJZGx4SHU4M3RSQVAzanpxcUR4OXNLX19nbXlrTTJZTW5fdWg3bGxKVGVZNC1DU1hfdEQycmJHakc1WHE</guid></item><item><title>轮式肺癌筛查-《纽约时报》 | Lung Cancer Screening on Wheels - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVXlIOEJHMm5uMkRtZHJHMzBfd3R4ZXRLTmM1b05YQVZzZFQwdFBDT3BPQjh3MDRWYUZFOHNBNDBGaW5PUDRNaDllamNnNVNfOTFfV2Z4TkMzWE80bXhIQXNXRjJlMTBUWklPczJnWFBPQ0VuQTI0R0M2UkJWa0VBMS1CLXdDQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 07:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVXlIOEJHMm5uMkRtZHJHMzBfd3R4ZXRLTmM1b05YQVZzZFQwdFBDT3BPQjh3MDRWYUZFOHNBNDBGaW5PUDRNaDllamNnNVNfOTFfV2Z4TkMzWE80bXhIQXNXRjJlMTBUWklPczJnWFBPQ0VuQTI0R0M2UkJWa0VBMS1CLXdDQQ</guid></item><item><title>轮式肺癌筛查-《纽约时报》 | Lung Cancer Screening on Wheels - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOT1hZM3VUaEJ0bm03UXhOcWxpbjRsVnJWYWRuMEpHT01rRlZ5WFgweV9lMEw1STlhRnFkNkpFOHdZXzNvSWpZemZnTllRQi1BOGtKUlVNRndfZEVEdlZZdHhoaEJ1VnEtam5XUzBKbGxhaUowcHAxeVplOTBNaTdiUzNEZ0hIaDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 07:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOT1hZM3VUaEJ0bm03UXhOcWxpbjRsVnJWYWRuMEpHT01rRlZ5WFgweV9lMEw1STlhRnFkNkpFOHdZXzNvSWpZemZnTllRQi1BOGtKUlVNRndfZEVEdlZZdHhoaEJ1VnEtam5XUzBKbGxhaUowcHAxeVplOTBNaTdiUzNEZ0hIaDQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
