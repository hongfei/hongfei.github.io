The findings, based on a meta analysis of data from 96 studies involving more than 400,000 children across 21 countries, &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(25)00281-0/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The review suggests obesity was a “substantial driver” of the sharp uptick in childhood hypertension, with nearly 19% of those living with obesity affected by the condition, compared with fewer than 3% in children and teenagers considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The nearly twofold increase in childhood high blood pressure over 20 years should raise alarm bells for healthcare providers and caregivers,” said study author Prof Igor Rudan, the director of the Centre for Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Research at Edinburgh University’s Usher Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also suggests a further 8.2% of children and teenagers have prehypertension, meaning blood pressure levels are higher than normal but do not yet meet the criteria for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prehypertension is especially prevalent during adolescence, with rates reaching 11.8% among teenagers, compared with about 7% in younger children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors said blood pressure levels rose sharply in early adolescence, peaking about the age of 14, especially among boys. This underlined the critical importance of regular screening during these critical years, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Junk food leads to more children being obese than underweight for first time","elementId":"79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/10/junk-food-upf-more-children-obese-than-underweight-unicef"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children and teenagers with prehypertension are more likely to progress to full hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Steve Turner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who was not involved with the review, said: “This sharp rise in high blood pressure among children is deeply concerning and largely driven by increasing childhood obesity – an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These findings mirror what paediatricians are seeing on the frontline. Children are presenting not only with hypertension, but also other serious conditions linked to obesity such as type 2 diabetes – once unheard of in children – asthma and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that persistent hypertension is a risk factor for an early death due to damage to the cardiovascular system and other organs. Healthy children grow into healthy adults, but with trends like these, I fear that without urgent action we are hurtling towards a public health emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rate of children and teenagers experiencing high blood pressure globally nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020, according to the meta analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2000, about 3.2% of children had hypertension, but by 2020, the prevalence had increased to more than 6.2% of children and teenagers under 19, affecting 114 million young people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Study author Dr Peige Song, of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, said the uptick in cases was “driven largely by lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, and the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hypertension in children and adolescents has emerged as a substantial public health concern,” she said, adding that parents had a pivotal role in preventing and managing high blood pressure in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Promoting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while minimising salt and sugar intake, can substantially reduce the risk of hypertension. Encouraging regular physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviours, such as excessive screen time, are equally crucial,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For families with a history of hypertension, regular blood pressure monitoring for children is strongly recommended. Early detection of elevated blood pressure, particularly through home monitoring, can help mitigate the risk of long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved with the review, said he was very concerned about the rise: “Elevated blood pressure in childhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The good news was that obesity-related high blood pressure could be reversed, he said. But bold action was also needed from governments to prevent so many children from having obesity in the first place. “This includes expanding restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy products and exploring further measures to drive the food industry to make our everyday foods healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbFNWaHY2TlVWNFNWSGZxZ0ZWR3QxcFoyQUxaTHNLa3RRX3VqY3JZNDFKMTh1QmdhX2FNUC1HcjFxTkxxVjFmTmFWeWp2T2lmQndPbFJTZjFoLTBvS3gwTldUaXgzamUyNVdkc3JTNVdFOFVBNXNzTlp2bEV2V2tNV1gtNjUwWWNpUDN3eF9QQkxGWjhhamhvMlp3RnV5cy1yRFhuN3BHYXU</guid></item><item><title>裂孔性疝气是什么感觉？ 50岁以上的女性不应忽视的4个症状-女性世界</title><link>https://www.womansworld.com/wellness/hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-591114 single-format-standard post-hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50 theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

            Global rates of hypertension, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/health/childhood-obesity-cognitive-decline-wellness"&gt;high blood pressure, in childhood&lt;/a&gt; and adolescence have nearly doubled since 2000, putting more kids at risk for poor health later in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900083b6nsaiqi8jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2000, about 3.4% of boys and 3% of girls had hypertension. By 2020, those numbers had risen to 6.5% and 5.8% respectively,” said Dr. Peige Song, a researcher from the School of Public Health at Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Song is one of the authors of a study describing the findings that published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900093b6n6ea4r93c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who have hypertension could be at greater risk later on of developing heart disease –– &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the No. 1 cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, said Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000a3b6nd46b1zll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that this is a modifiable risk,” Song said in an email. “With better screening, earlier detection, and a stronger focus on prevention, especially around healthy weight and nutrition, we can intervene before complications arise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000b3b6n4hcld71t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise in hypertension in children is likely due to many factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000c3b6nu1288h8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Childhood obesity is a significant risk factor, because it is associated with factors like insulin resistance, inflammation and vascular function, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000d3b6n52urp9lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary factors such as consuming high levels of sodium and ultraprocessed food can also contribute to hypertension risk, as well as poor sleep quality, stress and genetic predisposition, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000e3b6nz52l7v5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many children also get less movement than past generations and spend more time on sedentary activities, like screen use, which may be affecting risk, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000f3b6npefll77w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are also starting to know that other factors, including environmental pollutants, can contribute,” Zhang added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw7fvby00023b6n82iayngg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zhang served as senior author on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/pfas-blood-pressure-teens-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a previous study&lt;/a&gt; that showed a connection between prebirth exposure to chemicals called PFAS — a class of about 15,000 human-made compounds linked to cancers, endocrine-related conditions and developmental issues in children — and childhood hypertension. Short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS are sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000g3b6nnzu0m8du@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The biggest takeaway of this research for families is not to assume high blood pressure is only a problem for adults, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000h3b6ntmk3wskw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are worried about your child’s risk for obesity or hypertension, pressure, shame and restriction are not the best approaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000i3b6ng2y4iswg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, focus on increasing healthy behaviors in a happy way, said Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian in Massachusetts, in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/health/kids-size-health-wellness"&gt;a previous CNN article&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000j3b6nrto53sp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of the food pillar is really to embrace flexibility with food and to emphasize foods that are highly nutritious and … to allow foods also that might be minimally nutritious within the diet in ways that can be fully enjoyed and flexible,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000k3b6nlzirsnbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to prioritize sitting down as a family for meals and avoid labeling foods as “good” or “bad,” said Castle, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kids-Thrive-Every-Size-Between/dp/152352183X" target="_blank"&gt;Kids Thrive at Every Size&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000l3b6nbgm4zqvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The clean plate club or rewarding with sweets — they might work in the moment, but they don’t do a good job of establishing the self-trust and an intuitive, good relationship with food as kids grow up,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000m3b6n5jerqgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study didn’t just track rates in the United States. Instead, researchers analyzed data from 96 studies across 21 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000n3b6nqooncpgr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another important consideration the study team made is how blood pressure differs in and outside the doctor’s office. Some children might have normal blood pressure at home, but a higher reading in the office, while others might have a lower blood pressure in the office than they normally would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000o3b6ng9l747cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By including data from both office visits and at-home blood pressure readings, the researchers were able to include hypertension rates that are “masked,” or wouldn’t be caught in a doctor’s visit, Zhang said. Masked hypertension was found to be the most common kind, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000p3b6n8hf6cjkc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is important because it means that many children with true hypertension could go undetected if we rely only on office blood pressure readings,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000q3b6nmhrf70r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result show that one reading may not be enough, and there may be a need for more scalable solutions for better monitoring and care of hypertension around the world, Song added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

(Ivanhoe Newswire)  — &lt;/span&gt;The number of adults living with diabetes worldwide has surpassed 800 million, and the World Health Organization calls Type 2 diabetes an epidemic. But new science is giving hope. With more than 300 clinical trials underway, experts say prevention, early detection, and innovative treatments could dramatically change the outlook for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lindsey Kovaleski, Type 1 diabetes has been part of her life since she was 12 -- just a little older than her girls, Lila and Evie, are now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember now being thirsty all the time. I remember running to the bathroom all the time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsey has navigated three decades of evolving treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started off with multiple daily injections," she told Ivanhoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, diabetes research seems to be moving at lightning speed. There's a new class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They are drugs that mimic a natural hormone to regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. The next generation, triple agonists, is already in trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really optimistic that those two things will decrease the need for orthopedic intervention in diabetic patients and ultimately decrease the need for amputation," said Dr. Mark J. Berkowitz, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Foot and Ankle Center at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEALTH CHECK: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is transforming care as well. Continuous glucose sensors now link to insulin pumps that predict blood sugar spikes and drops before they happen, adjusting insulin automatically, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are devices where patients can have their glucose readings immediately without poking their fingers," Dr. Barbara Gisella Carranza Leon, an endocrinologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also testing cell-based therapies that regenerate the insulin-producing beta cells destroyed by diabetes, with early trials showing some patients live months without insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine having a medicine before that you had to give yourself twice a day, once a day, and now once a week. I'm looking forward to what is going to happen in the next 10 years," said Carranza Leon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are engineering islet cells that evade the immune system, making pancreas transplants possible without immune-suppressing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study at Harvard shows that a Mediterranean-style diet combined with moderate exercise and professional weight-loss support lowered the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 31% in older adults -- proof that lifestyle changes, along with these cutting-edge treatments, can help turn the tide of this global epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors to this news report include Marsha Lewis, producer; Matt Goldschmidt, videographer; and Roque Correa, editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:34:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxQYlg5Q3ktUHBaS2xhWlBxTFEzYWFCRFllRzEyMVdrQWpQeU9kTU5Ec29ESFJiUzBtZFFYN2pqdVVnRDM1dmhjam5wRGE3dzE5QnpCYUJQY2lYeDhIX2MxNHB4U2VvRGE2cVBvWHIzMjc1N0ItUE1OWUl4VHZtekxmZF95VEpuRkZieHI0cnUtcnVoVGt0STQzeTV4ZEtqZ1A0RGYweU9pSEZhU3VVYzlzZVpFWWFTeUlSNEZaQ1daTzE0d2o3WW1XUkwtSWNVa1NFMWs2U1l5UmVUR05ZZktVejNhd096eFFqZGZkTW5xMHpDR2pYWWZwSUcxQm4wTmhmSDFQYVM0SVNMSHo4WlhOWFlUYWNnNkE</guid></item><item><title>营养学家正在为您的健康分享最好（和最差）的早餐谷物，其中一些可能会让您感到惊讶- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/robinasbell/best-worst-breakfast-cereals-for-health-sc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA food classification system has been causing unnecessary confusion about which foods are “ultraprocessed.” It was developed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and it groups foods by their level of processing and recommends avoiding “ultraprocessed foods” like candy and soda. All breakfast cereal is lumped in the ultraprocessed category. This has prompted debate among nutrition experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:%20courtney.pelitera@rd.topnutritioncoaching.com" target="_blank"&gt;Courtney Pelitera&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietician (RD), thinks the NOVA scale is being misinterpreted. “Processing simply refers to all physical, biological and chemical methods used during the food manufacturing process, including the use of additives. This classification system was never meant to determine the ‘healthiness of food’ as has become popular on social media channels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to RD &lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/inside-oldways/staff/kelly-leblanc/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Kelly Toups LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt;, the VP of Nutrition Programming at Oldways, not all ultra-processed foods are created equal. “Some ultra-processed foods, like whole grain breakfast cereals, contain important food groups recommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Other ultra-processed foods, like candy bars and soft drinks, do not.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She takes issue with the way the NOVA list categorizes foods, especially whole-grain cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, refined grains like all-purpose flour, degermed cornmeal, and white rice, which have been processed to have their healthful bran and germ removed, are somehow considered minimally processed, putting them in the same category as fresh broccoli — while packaged 100% whole grain breads and whole grain breakfast cereals are considered ultra-processed,” LeBlanc said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that whole grain cereals can be an important part of nutrition assistance programs, providing valuable nutrition to vulnerable populations. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346?via%3Dihub=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;In a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from the USDA, government scientists designed a nutritious seven-day, 2,000-calorie diet in which 91% of calories came from ultra-processed foods,” LeBlanc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does an RD look for in a breakfast cereal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                Patients who are infected with malaria and dengue virus receive treatment in an isolation ward at a hospital in Pakistan. Drugs known as artemisinins have been remarkably effective in helping malaria patients recover but there's concern that the malaria parasite is developing resistance. A new drug called GanLum seems to offer a promising alternative.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure," says &lt;a href="https://www.mmv.org/about-us/our-team/george-jagoe" target="_blank"&gt;George Jagoe&lt;/a&gt;, executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. "No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/15/g-s1-34176/malaria-drug-resistance-children-artemisinin-africa" target="_blank"&gt;worrying signs&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing," says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a big deal," says &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/kasturi-haldar/" target="_blank"&gt;Kasturi Haldar&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. "It's also pretty timely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. "Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa," says &lt;a href="https://microbiology.columbia.edu/faculty-david-fidock" target="_blank"&gt;David Fidock&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. "We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. "That is very desirable for a drug to have," says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. "But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs," says Haldar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That “means the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year’s vaccine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-464b40" class="body-graf"&gt;The U.K. is heading “into what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,” the head of the U.K.’s National Health Service, &lt;a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/press-releases/message-hope-james-mackey-annual-conference-2025" target="_blank"&gt;James Mackey, said last week.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4aa332" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that’s “unprecedented,” Rasmussen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae4e63" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntv.co.jp/englishnews/articles/2021g5qxrh7d4go17jck.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japanese news outlet Nippon TV&lt;/a&gt; reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. &lt;a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h02601/" target="_blank"&gt;More than 2,300 day cares and schools&lt;/a&gt; in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-228e3c" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are not good signs,” Rasmussen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-09fb7e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-400a2b" class="body-graf"&gt;H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-076a78" class="body-graf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t provided a detailed,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-38.html" target="_blank"&gt; national report on flu activity&lt;/a&gt; since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e7529" class="body-graf"&gt;Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the “hollowing out” of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-workers-fired-trump-administration-chaos-rcna237623" target="_blank"&gt; 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7b2f9" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,” Schaffner said. “The information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e8427e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this year’s flu shot be helpful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-007474" class="body-graf"&gt;Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year’s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/understand-the-2025-2026-flu-vaccine-composition-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7a7207" class="body-graf"&gt;The annual flu shot doesn’t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It’s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;up to 55% effective&lt;/a&gt; in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-074fdb" class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;health authorities in the U.K. published&lt;/a&gt; preliminary evidence that this year’s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00de0c" class="body-graf"&gt;Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1deb86" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“All of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 20:52:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPYjdMTHcySGcwSlJhYXFZcC1uM2FuR2NSTXNPY3BNRlV5UFE4RGtOVDVZTFBlS1ZubXByM3IxQkYzWDJZMjhQanlrZ3NPSkZhU1lHbVBXbGJLd2RlRnJPbjN2QmF0Q1l5cndLRFVHM093VnQ0STBBMnFzMFF3UlFvM2ZDWF9veXFuM2syY1BCWnFUejlvNFhvQnRGYnJSZlFreG1GcXcxZ0VXeGPSAVZBVV95cUxObnJhY3RMZUFoTXZkWHM2N1hqYXpkVjR6ZXRxbTEwOUhVQjhPaE1rcHNhcnhhQUd3c1ZzQkJxbHJtZmVKV2hUQUNLYXpLR0pHdVBLQWRndw</guid></item><item><title>美国卫生领导人称赞激素治疗更年期的好处。医生正在推动平衡- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8hvq000x2cnja9mm34me@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;remove the “black box” warning&lt;/a&gt; on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00022e6fzxt827bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1987891721922138128" target="_blank"&gt;antibiotics and vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwax2o6001v3b6qijj2zmmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary blamed the broad&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb4bqp00243b6qedceb4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb38i900213b6qqlif026a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb5qa100263b6q2yyy3btd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb7jqz002g3b6q0pirwzho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwaw547001s3b6qr5vomf7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive research review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb6a1r002a3b6qp0axhpao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00052e6fp0iuc4vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwao5sc00153b6q3e5a5luf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000f2e6fjno14x4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000i2e6fhdoflnc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000g2e6f1xhkau1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women stopped using hormones in droves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000h2e6fnr8b7qsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000j2e6f8xlrpmy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000l2e6fx6y9gltc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000m2e6fthozsvys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;most of the black box warning&lt;/a&gt; — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;expert panel&lt;/a&gt; discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000n2e6f6tr64aj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000o2e6frnwc5dd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;a Viewpoint article&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000p2e6fyaqmxqa9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000q2e6fmkm8hagb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000r2e6f1f9waqvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Makary also didn’t mention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000t2e6fym2eib53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000u2e6f0bcq9lvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000v2e6f7917bay7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000w2e6f5ejegtbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, the agency has followed &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-requires-removal-some-prescribing-and-dispensing-restrictions" target="_blank"&gt;a very different protocol&lt;/a&gt; when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-revises-description-mental-health-side-effects-stop-smoking" target="_blank"&gt;followed similar steps&lt;/a&gt;, including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000y2e6fiegh68sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000z2e6fhkt1g061@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwai2as00113b6ql198ibz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00132e6fwjgaevk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00142e6fawrsrdhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwcklm900003b6qjvc4kz51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00162e6fyeytklhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00172e6ff5ucoacl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00182e6fjts7bpiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00192e6fj7td5js1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001a2e6fdjbmwjyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001b2e6fhd00gztx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001c2e6fnyvqu9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001e2e6fpe1tsdw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001f2e6fam6pwjqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001g2e6fp3veyrbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001h2e6fz01skpsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9632404/#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20case%2Dcontrol%20study%20in%20Sweden%20found,gave%20similar%20risk%20estimates%20as%20oral%20regimens" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001i2e6f1a1k8xab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001j2e6fqcpuwdv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001k2e6fjejxsm2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001l2e6f10026pxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001m2e6fz52e5com@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001n2e6fbovpi2gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001o2e6fs0p34u17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001p2e6f842zwmf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001q2e6f3ejr6eoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001r2e6f6fn8w2qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001s2e6f1j0fdssa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840561?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=201958" target="_blank"&gt;recent viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001t2e6fs0s9pwb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001u2e6fhhmlnqvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwbdg0v002u3b6qpt9r6gob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001v2e6fkkoacw7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Oddly, about 20% of the B cells in our bodies are &lt;i&gt;autoreactive&lt;/i&gt;. They target antigens belonging to our own tissues — not by design, but due to the random way B-cell diversity comes about: through sloppy replication, apparently engineered by evolution to ensure diversification. Fortunately, these B cells are typically in a dopey state of inertia, and they pretty much leave our tissues alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But at times, somnolent autoreactive B cells become activated, take aim at our own tissues and instigate one of the disorders collectively called autoimmunity. Some awakened autoreactive B cells crank out antibodies that bind to proteins and DNA inside the nuclei of our cells. Such activated “antinuclear antibodies” — the hallmark of lupus — trigger damage to tissues randomly distributed throughout the body, because virtually all our body’s cells have nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of EBV-infected people (most of us, that is) have no idea they’re still sheltering a virus and never get lupus. But essentially everyone with lupus is EBV-infected, studies have shown. An EBV-lupus connection has been long suspected but never nailed down until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;The antinuclear B cell gets ornery&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Although latent EBV is ubiquitous in the sense that almost everybody carries it, it resides in only a tiny fraction of any given person’s B cells. As a result, until the new study, it was virtually impossible for existing methods to identify infected B cells and distinguish them from uninfected ones. But Robinson and his colleagues developed an extremely high-precision sequencing system that enabled them to do this. They found that fewer than 1 in 10,000 of a typical EBV-infected but otherwise healthy individual’s B cells are hosting a dormant EBV viral genome.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Employing their new EBV-infected-B-cell-identifying technology along with bioinformatics and cell-culture experimentation, the researchers found out how such small numbers of infected cells can cause a powerful immune attack on one’s own tissues. In lupus patients, the fraction of EBV-infected B cells rises to about 1 in 400 — a 25-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s known that the latent EBV, despite its near-total inactivity, nonetheless occasionally nudges the B cell it’s been snoozing in to produce a single viral protein, EBNA2. The researchers showed that this protein acts as a molecular switch — in geneticists’ language a “transcription factor” — activating a battery of genes in the B cell’s genome that had previously been at rest. At least two of the human genes switched on by EBNA2 are recipes for proteins that are, themselves, transcription factors that turn on a variety of other pro-inflammatory human genes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The net effect of all these genetic fireworks is that the B cell becomes highly inflammatory: It dons its “professional antigen-presenting cell” uniform and starts stimulating other immune cells (called helper T cells) that happen to share a predilection for targeting cell-nuclear components. These helper T cells enlist multitudes of other antinuclear B cells as well as antinuclear killer T cells, vicious attack dogs of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;When that militia bulks up, it doesn’t matter whether any of the newly recruited antinuclear B cells are EBV-infected or not. (The vast majority of them aren’t.) If there are enough of them, the result is a bout of lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Robinson said he suspects that this cascade of EBV-generated self-targeting B-cell activation might extend beyond lupus to other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, where hints of EBV-initiated EBNA2 activity have been observed.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question: If about 95% of us are walking around with latent EBV in our B cells, why do some of us, but not all of us, get autoimmunity? Robinson speculates that perhaps only certain EBV strains spur the transformation of infected B cells into antigen-presenting “driver” cells that broadly activate huge numbers of antinuclear B cells.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Many companies are working on an EBV vaccine, and clinical trials of such a vaccine are underway. But that vaccine would have to be given soon after birth, Robinson noted, as such vaccines are unable to rid an already-infected person of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Stanford University’s Office of Technology Licensing has filed a provisional patent application on intellectual property associated with the study’s findings and technologies used to obtain them. Robinson, Younis and a third study co-author, Mahesh Pandit, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in immunology and rheumatology, are named inventors on the application. They are co-founders and stockholders of a company, EBVio Inc., a company exploring&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an experimental lupus treatment, ultradeep B-cell depletion. This procedure involves total annihilation of all circulating B cells, which are replaced over the following few months by new, EBV-free B cells born continually in the bone marrow. Robinson is also a director of EBVio Inc. and a co-founder and shareholder of Flatiron Bio, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati; the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine; the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; and Rockefeller University contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We really do 'fall' asleep, a new study shows. Far from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-silence-your-thoughts-and-drift-off-to-sleep-an-expert-explains"&gt;gently drifting off&lt;/a&gt;, the brain rapidly transitions into sleep after passing a tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain scans taken from thousands of volunteers, researchers from Imperial College London (ICL) and the University of Surrey in the UK discovered a surprisingly sudden change in electrical activity around 4.5 minutes before the onset of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered that falling asleep is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory"&gt;bifurcation&lt;/a&gt;, not a gradual process, with a clear tipping point that can be predicted in real time," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/270894/falling-asleep-follows-brain-tipping-point/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ICL neuroscientist Nir Grossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to track how individual brains fall asleep has profound implications for our understanding of the sleep process and for developing new treatments for people who struggle with falling asleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's model converted 47 features of brain activity captured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) into an abstract mathematical space. This allowed them to record changes in the brain between bedtime and sleep, which, when mapped as a trajectory, resembles a ball rolling down a steepening slope towards a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-180977 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1-600x234.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphical illustration of the computational framework, transforming one-dimensional EEG data (a) into a many-dimensional space (b) to calculate how close someone is to sleep when they nod off (c).

Permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pilot study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2511778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a novel gene therapy was able to reduce patients’ low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – 'bad' cholesterol – by almost 50 per cent, as well as triglycerides by an average of 55 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future trials continue to be successful, then the single, one-off treatment could replace the daily cocktail of drugs millions take to control their cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that our livers naturally produce. If they build up in our blood, however, they can cause fatty deposits. These can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is responsible for 1 in 3 deaths in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/the-discoveries-bringing-an-end-to-heart-attacks"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death,” &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/steven-nissen/4268279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Nissen&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner School of Medicine, in the US, told &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissen was part of a group that hoped to reduce people’s cholesterol levels by targeting the ANGPTL3 gene, which is associated with LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1 in 250 people have a mutation that turns this gene off. As a result, these people have low levels of both blood fats. “Importantly, they also have a low incidence of cardiovascular disease,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, who gets the benefit of this mutation isn’t solely up to the genetic lottery anymore, thanks to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/crispr"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;, the gene-editing technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/11/Purple-.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="DNA with a section pulled out by tweezers" class="wp-image-209201"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;CRISPR selectively modifies DNA by targeting specific genes. - Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR, Nissen and his colleagues were able to tailor the therapy to switch off the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver. It was then administered, via an infusion, to 15 patients for an preliminary trial to test its safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, the treatment substantially lowered the participants’ LDL and triglyceride levels. The study confirmed they remained low 60 days later, but according to Nissen, “These changes are expected to be permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend keeping LDL cholesterol levels below 100mg/dL for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/the-heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health. While diet and exercise can help, many people struggle to meet this goal, particularly those with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications can help, but none of them lower both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides simultaneously. As a result, people often have to take multiple daily medications throughout their lives to manage their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next phase of the trial will begin within a few months and involve more patients with elevations in LDL cholesterol or triglycerides,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these continue to be successful, then the medication could offer a long-term weapon in the quest to defeat one of the world’s biggest killers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, we don’t just lose body fat – we lose muscle, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem for many reasons, because skeletal muscle is far more than the tissue that helps us move. It plays a crucial role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-2395-3-9"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, regulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00033.2024"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/54.5.B207"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;. Losing muscle mass is linked to a reduced mobility, increased injury risk and is thought to potentially impair long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With millions of people now using weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, understanding what impact this muscle loss &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6586"&gt;might have on their health&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass is also a significant challenge for athletes too, as many sports encourage them to keep body weight low while still maintaining demanding training loads and keeping their power-output high. So an energy deficit can put significant stress on an athlete’s body – but to what extent it affects their normal function, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40279-024-02108-y"&gt;is unclear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these widespread implications, we still know surprisingly little about how human muscle responds at the molecular level to the combination of calorie restriction and exercise. Understanding what happens to muscle when exercising in a calorie deficit is extremely important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202502384RR"&gt;Newly published research&lt;/a&gt; from myself and my colleagues casts light on this exact topic. We showed that weight loss accompanied by aerobic exercise might not be that bad for the muscles after all – and indeed it may have positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited ten healthy, fit young men who completed two tightly controlled five-day experimental trials in our laboratory. During their first trial period, they consumed enough calories to maintain their body weight. But during the second, we reduced their daily calorie intake by 78% – a severe energy deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During both trials, participants completed a tightly-controlled, 90-minute low- to moderate-intensity cycling exercise three times during each five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trials, we measured blood markers such as glucose, ketones, fatty acids and key hormones linked to energy preservation. We did this to determine if – and to what extent – the energy deficit was affecting them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also collected muscle biopsies before and after each testing period. Using an advanced method called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9802-9_9"&gt;dynamic proteomic profiling&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the production and abundance of hundreds of muscle proteins. This allowed us to build a detailed picture of how muscle adapts to sudden, substantial calorie restriction – even when exercise demands are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the five days in an energy deficit, participants lost about 3kg. Hormones such as leptin, T3 and IGF-1 also dropped sharply – clear signs the body was getting into an energy preservation mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inside the muscle itself, something more unexpected was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Muscle tissue changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The muscle tissue mounted a strong and surprisingly positive response to the combination of exercise and calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we saw an increase in the amount of mitochondrial proteins within the muscle – and these proteins were also being created more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the power generators inside cells. They convert fat and carbohydrates into usable energy. Higher amounts of mitochondrial proteins, and faster production of them, are hallmarks of a healthier and more efficient muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The positive changes we saw within the muscle tissue correlated with a more youthful muscle profile.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/mans-grip-on-his-painful-elbow-2327824925"&gt;BigBlueStudio/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw a clear decrease in the amount and production of collagen and collagen-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collagen is an abundant protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength to the muscle. However, collagen tends to accumulate in excess as we age – contributing to stiffness and impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these changes resemble a shift toward a more metabolically youthful muscle profile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of response has also been seen in long-term calorie-restriction &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.12.002"&gt;studies in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time it has been demonstrated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Healthier ageing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the body would invest energy in maintaining or improving muscle during a time of scarcity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue is demanding and costly to maintain – and movement is energetically expensive, too. Shouldn’t the body simply reduce muscle activity to save energy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may lie in our evolutionary past. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers, who often faced periods of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30573-1"&gt;low food availability&lt;/a&gt;. During those times, the ability to move efficiently – to walk and run long distances, forage or hunt – was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01876-x"&gt;essential for survival&lt;/a&gt;. A body that shut down muscle function during hunger would have been less likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the protective response we observed may reflect deep evolutionary adaptations: muscles stay ready to move even when fuel is running low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study involved a small number of young men who were deliberately following an extreme energy deficit for a short period of time. As such, we cannot assume identical responses in women, older adults or people who are obese or have chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare weight loss with and without exercise, examine less extreme calorie deficits, include women and older adults, and measure how these molecular changes translate into actual physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that exercise during weight loss may protect muscle quality – and may even enhance characteristics linked to healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings also have key implications for many people. People who are taking weight loss drugs or trying to lose weight may benefit from structured exercise to help them preserve muscle quality. Older adults, who are more vulnerable to muscle loss, may especially benefit from exercising while losing weight. Athletes may approach any energy deficit with care, but know that muscle keeps adapting to exercise stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that human muscle is remarkably resilient. Even under severe stress, when much of the body is trying to conserve energy, muscle tissue seems to respond robustly – boosting its energy-producing machinery and limiting age-related degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, losing weight and exercising doesn’t just help preserve muscle – it may help keep it younger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        

        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Conversation</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:28:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOLUdPb1BwNUppMElXTUdGSm45UVdWaVBldXltdENXRkcwOVZRRXlrSkRJMEJMVEZ0TS1GU3FONFB4dEpnWG5sVkJ2RlFiSHl1Mk1yMWRtRU5NT0R1Y2ZTMXJld3lIdEhDM2ZJRHdqbkdRNnRoWlJJNEtGY2Rpa3RIV0F1dk5yRV9vUkFLcWlyWlVmdS1IaTMzYW8xaVRLeU5aTU1BN2lKbnFKcWJBVDB1VHE0MkF0OW1xQmc</guid></item><item><title>可能有助于延长寿命和减缓衰老的五种生活方式改变-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/five-lifestyle-changes-that-might-help-you-live-longer-and-slow-down-ageing-268326</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society is fascinated with health, fitness and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/longevity-20168"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. This obsession has spawned a multi-million pound industry centred around pushing the latest cutting-edge science, lifestyle modifications and products that claim to prevent ageing and live as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the secret to a long life doesn’t have to be so complicated. There are many simple things everyone can do to slow down time and feel younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about age, we aren’t always talking about how many candles are on your birthday cake. We actually have two different ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is of course chronological age. This is the number of years you’ve been alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have a “&lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/abc/a/mJmKp8SPc4fcQWNQ7HhyMKf/?lang=en"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;.” This is sometimes referred to as “true age” or “internal body age.” This refers to how well all of the body’s internal systems are functioning by looking for signs of ageing in the cells, blood and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that a person’s biological age, rather than their chronological age, is related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-pdf/76/7/1295/38620245/glab069.pdf"&gt;how long they live&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say you looked at two 60-year-old people. The person whose biological age is younger would be more likely to outlive the person who had a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now many ways to measure your biological age with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8856/5/2/28"&gt;epigenetic testing&lt;/a&gt;, which only requires a little bit of spit and can be done at home. The saliva sample is then processed in a lab where the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2018.1461295"&gt;DNA is extracted&lt;/a&gt; to get information about what’s happening in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The everyday lifestyle choices we make affects our biological age. While some of the decisions we make can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18611"&gt;increase it&lt;/a&gt; (such as drinking, smoking or being inactive), other factors can actually turn back the clock. Thus, how long we live may truly be in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five evidence-backed ways of reducing your biological age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Run away from ageing – literally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being more physically active and regularly exercising throughout life reduces risk of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.236"&gt;death from all causes&lt;/a&gt; – directly increasing longevity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also never too late to get started. One study found that sedentary people who adopted an eight-week exercise programme (60 minute workouts done three times a week) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2023.2228388"&gt;reversed their biological age&lt;/a&gt; by around two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mixture of strength and endurance exercises done three to four times a week (with sessions as short as 23 minutes) is also shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13841"&gt;significantly reduce ageing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise influences something called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;, a process which controls whether certain genes are “on” or “off.” As we age it’s natural that our genes start switching off – this is why we get winkles and grey hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exercise helps to slow these processes down, meaning the genes that help do important functions in the body continue doing their job for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. You are what you eat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112431"&gt;healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; directly reduces biological age. This effect is even greater in those with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;chronic disease&lt;/a&gt; and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One study, which looked at nearly 2,700 women, found that adopting healthier eating patterns for 6-12 months was a key factor in staying &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab307"&gt;younger for longer&lt;/a&gt;. This diet was also shown to slow ageing by an average of 2.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Healthier foods choices may lower your biological age by years.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/salmon-superfood-salad-grilled-fish-kale-2390870025"&gt;Sea Wave/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-00841-x"&gt;Healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; included eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, lean proteins and healthy fats (such as oil) and reducing intake of red meat, saturated fat, added sugars and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet provides antioxidants, vitamins and anti-inflammatory compounds that help cells repair damage and reduce stress on our DNA. These nutrients also influence DNA methylation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Improve sleep habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of healthy ageing because it affects nearly every bodily system. Good quality sleep allows the body to repair DNA, restore hormonal balance, reduce inflammation and clear &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1134/S2079057025600053"&gt;cellular waste&lt;/a&gt; – helping the immune, metabolic and nervous systems stay youthful and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One review showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coemr.2021.03.021"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; is directly associated with how fast we age. People who sleep less than five hours per night have a significantly increased risk of age-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a large UK study of nearly 200,000 participants found that those on shift work – and particularly night shifts – had a biological age &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01575-z"&gt;around one year higher&lt;/a&gt; than their counterparts who worked at normal hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Avoid unhealthy vices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-023-01577-8"&gt;vaping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-025-01485-x"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.205153"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt; are the strongest and most consistent accelerators of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking, for instance, is shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-019-0777-z"&gt;rapidly age&lt;/a&gt; the lungs by up to 4.3 years and the airway cells by nearly five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a study looking at 8,046 adults aged 30–79 years old found that consuming any amount of alcohol was associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16501"&gt;accelerated biological ageing&lt;/a&gt;. The more alcohol consumed the more age is accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits speed up biological ageing because they directly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15376516.2018.1528650"&gt;damage DNA&lt;/a&gt;, increase inflammation and overload cells with stress. This causes the body and organs to work harder – ageing them quicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Master your mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress management is key. Research shows that being able to regulate emotions and manage stress levels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01735-7"&gt;predicts age acceleration&lt;/a&gt;. Another study found that working more than 40 hours a week on average &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203872"&gt;increased biological age by two years&lt;/a&gt;, probably due to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress can directly accelerate biological age due to the way it affects hormonal response, damages DNA and reduces immunity. Stress can also indirectly affect other factors that may accelerate age, such as diet, sleep and whether we drink or smoke. This is why having a set of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559031/"&gt;positive coping mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to manage stress is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01597-7"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; is also showing that factors such as loneliness, exposure to extreme heat and cold, air pollution and our environment (such as living in deprived areas) can all also affect how we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the affect of these factors on age may vary depending on the person, their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295054/"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, how long they’ve stuck with these lifestyle habits and other factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this gives insight into how changing even small habits can positively improve health and well-being and, in some cases, turn back the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

In accordance with Danish legislation, the above-mentioned ethics committee waived the need for specific informed consent in biomedical research based on existing biobanks. iPSYCH was approved by the ethics committee in 2012, with subsequent amendments in 2013, 2015 and 2018. More details can be found at &lt;a href="https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval"&gt;https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval&lt;/a&gt;. New Danish legislation (effective from January 2024) introduces the possibility for participants to opt out of studies that are exempt from active informed consent. After consulting with the Ethics Committees and patient organizations, iPSYCH contacted all participants (around 140,000) in the iPSYCH cohort in June 2025 and offered the possibility of opting out of new genetic studies initiated henceforth. Overall, 1.8% of the iPSYCH participants chose to opt out, and their data will be deleted from the active research database. Data included in finalized and ongoing studies will not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical data were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Würzburg in Germany. In the Netherlands, they were approved by the regional ethics committee (Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek: CMO Regio Arnhem—Nijmegen; protocol III.04.0403 and 2014/290; ABR: NL47721.091.14) and the Institutional Review Board of the Radboud University Medical Center. Participants were included at the Department of Psychiatry at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre.

The samples were included in iPSYCH in 2012–2016 and the sequencing was performed in 2012–2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the comorbidity analyses, we identified individuals with the following ICD10 diagnosis codes in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry: ID (ICD10: F70, F71, F72, F73, F78 and F79); ASD (as above); schizophrenia (as above); DBDs (including conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ICD10: F91 and F90.1); SUDs (ICD10: F10.1–9, F11.1–9, F12.1–9, F13.1–9, F14.1–9, F15.1–9, F16.1–9, F17.1–9, F18.1–9 and F19.1–9) and multi-comorbidities, which, besides the comorbidities already listed, included comorbid anxiety (ICD10: F40.0–F40.2, F41.0–F41.1, F42 and F43.0–F43.1), tic disorder (ICD10: F95), bipolar disorder (ICD10: F30–F31), major depressive disorder (ICD10: F32–F33), anorexia nervosa (ICD10: F50.0), DDs (ICD10: F80–F83) and antisocial personality disorder (ICD10: F60.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Clinical samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical samples consisted of adults (over 18 years old) with persistent ADHD diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria. None of the individuals was diagnosed with ID. They were recruited as part of the International Multicenter Persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) at two sites: Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, and University Hospital Würzburg, Germany. In analyses of these clinical samples, we used control samples from individuals recruited together with the clinical cases at the IMpACT site at Radboud University Medical Center (ADHD-screened controls), and from 1,766 German control individuals who were recruited from the German MI Family Study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Broeckel, U. et al.

To recap, the sequencing of 34,544 individuals from the iPSYCH cohort was performed using the Illumina Nextera Capture kit and the Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The sequencing process was performed in waves, including a pilot wave and three more substantial production waves. After sequencing, raw data were processed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.3.4 to generate a variant call format (VCF) v.4.1 file.

Next, we did thorough, multiple-round quality checks on the samples and the genetic variations using Hail 0.1. Samples were removed if they lacked complete phenotype information; if the imputed sex was inconsistent with the reported sex in the registries; if duplicates or genetic outliers were identified by principal component analysis (PCA); if they had an estimated level of contamination greater than 5%; or if they had an estimated level of chimeric reads higher than 5%. In addition, one of each pair of related samples was removed if the pairwise pi-hat value was 0.2 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotypes were removed if they did not pass GATK variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) or had a read depth lower than 10 or higher than 1,000. QC was done in Hail 0.1. Homozygous alleles were removed if they had reference calls with a genotype quality lower than 25, homozygous alternate alleles with PL(HomRef) (that is, the phred-scaled likelihood of being homozygous reference) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 90% of reads supporting the alternate allele. Heterozygous alleles were removed if they had PL(HomRef) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 25% of reads supporting the alternate allele, less than 90% informative reads (that is, number of reads supporting the reference allele plus number of reads supporting the alternate allele &amp;lt; 90% of the read depth) or a probability of the allele balance (calculated from a binomial distribution centred on 0.5) less than 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. After these filters were applied, variants with a call rate lower than 90% were removed, then samples with a call rate lower than 95%, and then variants with a call rate lower than 95% were removed. After QC, 28,448 individuals and 1,362,971 variants remained for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we selected for this study the individuals diagnosed with ADHD and controls as described above, resulting in 8,895 cases and 9,001 controls (see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; for sample of individuals with other ancestries not included in this study). Finally, we defined rare variants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 565,053) as those with an allele count no higher than five across our dataset (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17,896) and the exome subset of gnomAD used in this study (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 44,779).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Clinical samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological samples collected at the Dutch and German IMpACT sites were sequenced at BGI, Shenzhen, China. The coding regions of the DNA were targeted using BGI´s exome-capture kit (developed by Beijing Genomics Institute targeting 58.8 Mb) and paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, with an average sequencing depth of 50×. The exome-sequencing data obtained from dbGaP were generated at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT using Illumina’s ICE Capture reagent kit, and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500. Bam files for all samples (clinical cases and dbGaP controls) were reprocessed together, adhering to the same QC approach described above for the iPSYCH samples. After this QC process, 2,816 samples, consisting of 1,078 individuals with ADHD and 1,738 controls, remained for further analysis. We were not able to obtain a group of completely homogenous individuals after the exclusion of genetic outliers based on PCA (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;), and thus, to minimize the effect of population stratification in subsequent analyses, we aimed at getting as close to de novo mutations as possible; we therefore included only ultra-rare variants, defined as singletons not in the non-psychiatric subsample of individuals in the ExAC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Lek, M. et al.

Following the same approach, the load of rare variants across variant categories in female individuals with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2,265) was compared with male individuals with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6,630), both with and without individuals with ID (1,827 female individuals without ID; 5,414 male individuals without ID). The burdens in all genes and genes stratified by their pLI score were evaluated. Covariates included in analyses of iPSYCH samples were: birth year, sex, the first ten principal components (PCs) from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples), total number of variants, number of rare synonymous variants, percentage of exome target covered at a read depth of at least 20, mean read depth at sites within the exome target passing VQSR, and sequencing wave (one-hot encoded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of different types of variant categories in gene sets was also tested for the clinical samples following the approach described above but restricting to ultra-rare variants and including the following covariates: sex, total number of variants, number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, number of all variants and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding individuals with non-European genetic ancestry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Gene-based burden tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase power for gene discovery, we combined iPSYCH data with a subset of 44,779 individuals from gnomAD&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="Karczewski, K.

Only variants in high-confidence regions for the two datasets were included, defined as regions in which at least 80% of the samples in both datasets had at least 10× sequencing coverage (based on analysis of bam files for the Danish samples and on coverage summary tables for gnomAD). To avoid biases caused by variations in call rates between cases (entirely iPSYCH) and controls (83.3% gnomAD), all autosomal genes with higher rates of rare synonymous variants in cases than controls were excluded (15,603 out of 18,866 autosomal genes remained; 3,263 excluded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were grouped depending on their impact on ADHD: class I variants include rPTVs and rare missense variants with MPC &amp;gt; 3 (rSevereDMVs); class II variants include missense variants with 2 ≤ MPC ≤ 3 (rModerateDMVs). Gene-based burden analysis was performed with a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Only genes with an increased load of class I (3,698 genes) and/or class II (1,026 genes) variants in cases compared with controls were considered. We did not consider genes with higher numbers of class I and II variants in controls, because such observations could be caused by a generally higher number of variants in controls, owing to the previous filtering step in which only genes with a higher number of rare synonymous variants in controls than in cases were retained. A small number of genes (347) had an increased load of both class I and class II variants in cases, and for these genes we also estimated the combined impact of class I and class II variants in a meta-analysis using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. Weights were the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for the classes in enrichment analysis of constrained genes. For the 347 genes, we used the minimum &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value across the three analyses done for these genes. In total, we tested 15,603 genes (347 genes were tested three times) resulting in 16,297 tests. We considered a gene significantly associated with ADHD if the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value was lower than 0.05/16,297 = 3.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described above, genes with an increased rate of rare synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD relative to controls were excluded to avoid biases when combining iPSYCH and gnomAD data. When inspecting the QQ-plot of rare synonymous variants (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), the plot revealed the anticipated pattern of inflation that corresponds to our gene selection strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clinical sample, we performed a gene-based burden test of class I variants using emmaxCMC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Li, B. &amp;amp; Leal, S.

This method allows for the incorporation of a kinship matrix to account for potential remaining population stratification among individuals. We generated the kinship matrix using ‘epacts make-kin --min-maf 0.01 --remove-complex’. In addition, we included sex, the number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, the number of all variants and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Gene-set analyses in the clinical sample&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for increased load of ultra-rare class I and class II variants in ADHD compared with controls in the clinical sample. We used different &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value thresholds from the gene-based burden test in iPSYCH + gnomAD samples to define three ADHD rare-variant risk gene sets: &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (20 genes), &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (316 genes) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (583 genes) (gene sets are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;). The control group included 870 with cardiovascular disease and 896 without, so we also tested for the potential difference in ultra-rare class I variants across the two groups in the three ADHD gene sets. Only class I variants were tested, because these were the only type of variants with a tendency to be overrepresented in clinical ADHD cases versus controls (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;, Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;). The gene sets were tested using logistic regression with sex, number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, number of all variants, and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;X-chromosome analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the distinct regions of the X chromosome, we applied region-specific thresholds to define rare variants: in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs), rare variants were defined as those with an allele count of five or less following what was done for the autosomes. In non-pseudoautosomal regions (nonPARs), the rare-variant threshold was adjusted to an allele count of three of less to account for the hemizygosity in male individuals. This adjustment was derived using a scaling factor based on the relative contributions of male individuals and female individuals in iPSYCH (6,002 female and 11,894 male individuals) and subset of gnomAD used in this study (19,916 female and 24,863 male individuals):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$5\times \frac{({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+2\times {{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}{2\times ({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+{{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}=3.53$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were categorized into class I, class II and synonymous variants, using the same criteria applied for autosomal variants. In the burden test of male individuals, the number of alleles for nonPAR variants was counted as two to account for hemizygosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression was performed on three gene sets stratified by their pLI score, comparing the following groups of individuals: ADHD versus controls; ADHD without ID versus controls; ADHD with ID versus controls; and ADHD with ID versus ADHD without ID. Covariates included birth year, sex, the first ten PCs from PCA (non-European samples excluded), total variant count, rare synonymous variant count, exome target coverage (percentage ≥ 20×), mean read depth at target sites and sequencing batch (one-hot encoded). In addition, sex-stratified analyses were performed using the same approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For gene discovery on the X chromosome, we applied the same approach as for autosomes when combining iPSYCH data with gnomAD. We excluded genes with higher numbers of synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD than in controls and retained genes with a higher rate of class I variants in cases than in controls (78 genes included) or a higher number of class II variants (44 genes). We performed gene-based burden analysis separately for male individuals and female individuals, in which we, for each gene, compared the number of individuals with ADHD carrying at least one class I or class II variant to the number found for control individuals, using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Notably, six genes had both increased class I and II variants in cases compared with controls; for these genes, a meta-analysis was used to combine the effect of class I and class II variants using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. The weight was determined as the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for class I and class II variants in the enrichment analysis of constrained genes on chromosome X (weight = 1.03/1.86 = 0.55). In total, we performed 78 × 3 tests for class I variants (female, male and combined), 44 × 3 tests for class II variants and 6 tests for combining class I and II, resulting in a total of 372 tests.

To generate UMAPs for these data, we did the following, using Python and the single-cell analysis libraries Scanpy and AnnData: for each of the four scRNA-seq datasets, the raw counts were filtered to contain genes represented in a minimum of 30 cells. Afterwards, the raw counts were normalized and log-transformed, and highly variable genes were identified using ‘highly_variable_genes’ in Seurat&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Satija, R., Farrell, J.

The expression data for the highly variable genes were scaled and used as input in PCA generated using the singular value decomposition (SVD) solver method in the ‘arpack’ algorithm implemented in Scanpy. PCs from the PCAs were then used to compute a neighbourhood graph generated using the Scanpy function ‘pp.neighbors’, which afterwards was embedded and visualized as a UMAP constructed with the Scanpy function tl.umap. For study I, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 20 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 100. For study II, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 40 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 30 for each of the 3 datasets. The parameters were set based on visual inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the&lt;i&gt; P&lt;/i&gt; values from the top 100 most associated genes from the gene-discovery analysis of iPSYCH + gnomAD samples as input for scDRS analysis, which was done separately for the above-described data from studies I, II and III. The number of genes was set to 100, which is the recommended minimum number of genes for the method. The method computes, on the basis of the expression of these 100 most significant genes, one raw disease score per cell. In addition, 1,000 raw control scores were computed for each cell. The control scores were generated using Monte Carlo sampling, in which 1,000 gene sets were produced, each consisting of 100 genes with similar gene size, mean gene expression and expression variance to that observed for the disease gene set. The computation of scores was corrected for relevant covariates (see below) and the number of genes in each of the cells. The normalized disease score was compared with the empirical normalized control score distribution to estimate a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value that quantifies the association between the disease genes and their expression in individual cells. These scores were used in the downstream scDRS cell-type-level analysis to test the association between the scores and predefined cell types using a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test and the top 5% quantile of the disease score of cells from the given cell type.

The day of cell collection (collected from week 6 to week 11) was also used as a covariate in analyses of data from study I. Sex was used as a covariate in the analyses of data from study II.

Finally, the scores from the 50 subsets, which together cover the full dataset, were assembled into one dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We binned the PGSs into pentiles, and ten dummy variables were generated identifying the individuals in each pentile bin who have at least one class I variant or none, respectively. Logistic regression of ADHD status on the nine dummy variables was performed to estimate the impact on ADHD risk in each PGS pentile using individuals in the first pentile with no class I variants in constrained genes as reference. This was done separately for individuals with no class I variants in constrained genes and for individuals with at least one class I variant in constrained genes. The regression was adjusted for individual birth year, total number of variants, number of rare synonymous variants, percentage of exome target covered at a read depth of at least 20, mean read depth at sites within the exome target passing VQSR, sequencing wave, and the first ten PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;C-alpha test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether the rare variants identified in ADHD and ASD come from the same underlying gene distribution, we performed C-alpha tests on the iPSYCH exome data, including both ADHD and ASD. This comparison was designed to be simultaneous. To start with, we identified individuals diagnosed with either ADHD or ASD by the end of 2016, along with a control group in the quality-controlled iPSYCH data (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 28,448). Subsequently, we defined and classified the rare variants into class I, class II and synonymous categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a C-alpha test between ADHD without ASD (ADHD only) and ASD without ADHD (ASD only), regardless of ID comorbidity. In addition, we stratified the samples by the presence or absence of ID to perform C-alpha tests between ADHD only and ASD only. A separate set of C-alpha tests compared the single disorders with the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C-alpha test&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Neyman, J. &amp;amp; Scott, E.

&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607"&gt;Exercise has big benefits for the brain, but the exact reasons why have been mysterious. Now, new studies suggest that exercised muscles release brain-boosting substances into the blood — and at least in lab animals, that boost can be transferred from one individual to another via an injection of those substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, common explanations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;why regular physical activity is good for the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed to better blood flow, less stress and a stronger heart. But those ideas didn't fully explain how movement directly affected neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607-2"&gt;Clues are emerging from animal research. In a study published in October in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899325005669?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899325005669?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brain Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one group of young adult mice ran freely on wheels for four weeks while others stayed sedentary. Scientists then isolated extracellular vesicles — molecular "packages" that carry proteins and genetic material — from the runners' blood and injected them into the sedentary mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4695f372-1fb4-4e7f-9723-1256d06a70bc"&gt;After getting these injections twice a week for four weeks, these treated sedentary mice grew about 50% more new brain cells in a memory-related region called the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hippocampus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, compared with untreated sedentary mice. Most of the new cells developed into mature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis. (For humans, there's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/can-adults-make-new-brain-cells-new-study-may-finally-settle-one-of-neurosciences-greatest-debates" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/can-adults-make-new-brain-cells-new-study-may-finally-settle-one-of-neurosciences-greatest-debates"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ongoing debate around whether neurogenesis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occurs in meaningful amounts in the adult brain.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mgconnol" target="_blank" data-url="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mgconnol" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meghan Connolly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta, told Live Science in an email that she was struck by how specific the effect was — vesicles isolated from running mice boosted neuron growth, while those from sedentary animals did not. The researchers don't yet know whether the vesicles entered the brain or acted indirectly through other bodily signals. But Connolly explained that the vesicles themselves carried many proteins linked to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; defenses and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this surge in new brain cells may matter only if those cells survive long enough to fully integrate into the brain's existing structure, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paul Lucassen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Amsterdam who was not part of the study. The study zoomed in on "newborn neurons that still need weeks to grow and wire themselves into the brain's existing circuits," he told Live Science in an email. "Only when they find their place in the network can they help shape learning and memory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f16c9f77-7ce7-4963-b50d-db5185a8b94b"&gt;Connolly said the next step is to test whether these vesicles can restore neurogenesis and improve memory in laboratory models of brain diseases — avenues that some researchers are already exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-fbWGzb8jjpSsQRZDuwLwJf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-fbWGzb8jjpSsQRZDuwLwJf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, published earlier this year in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)00011-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004225000112%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)00011-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004225000112%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;iScience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists used a well-established mouse model of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AD). In AD, neurons malfunction and die off over time in part due to a buildup of abnormal proteins, including amyloid and tau. In the experiment, one set of mice ran voluntarily on wheels for six months while another group was sedentary; the active mice showed less amyloid buildup in the cortex and better metabolism and memory than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of that study, the researchers gave vesicles from mice that had just exercised to sedentary Alzheimer's-model animals. The vesicles, delivered through the nose, reproduced the metabolic benefits but didn't improve memory or clearly reduce amyloid levels, they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8f99a949-66ff-4ac1-86e7-ef40909b5adc"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/mark-febbraio/" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/mark-febbraio/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Febbraio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Monash University and a member of the research team, explained that the intranasal delivery method may have affected memory outcomes because it requires light anesthesia. He told Live Science in an email that his group is now running follow-up experiments with human participants, comparing vesicles heading to and from the brain during exercise. Preliminary results hint that the vesicles heading toward the brain may be enriched for proteins affecting cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vesicles may be only one piece of this puzzle. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_9846506342847547781&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03955-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other recent studies in humans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest that regular exercise likely helps the brain via multiple biological pathways.

It’s a mixed answer, but the bright spot is scientific progress on vaccines. The Covid vaccines were produced faster than any previous effort, and are credited with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;saving millions of lives from 2021&lt;/a&gt; onwards. The mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – were designed within days of the Sars-CoV-2 genome being published in January 2020, and went into safety trials over the following months before finally being approved in the UK at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But could they have additional benefits? According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03432-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature, mRNA vaccines seem to trigger a powerful immune response that increases the median survival time by about 75% for certain cancer patients. These findings – which are being further developed – could indicate the power of repurposing vaccines and medicines that have already passed trials for safety and are available at reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How could Covid vaccines play a part in cancer treatment? Cancer develops when normal cells in the body grow and divide without control. Usually, cell division is strictly controlled, but when certain mutations happen – sometimes caused by tobacco, or radiation, inherited genetic factors or environmental exposure – the body is no longer able to stop uncontrolled cell growth. These cells (often referred to as malignant) build up to form a tumour – an abnormal growth. To keep growing, these cells create new blood vessels to feed themselves and start to spread around the body – called metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Our immune system is excellent at recognising invaders in our body – think of viruses or bacteria – but given that cancerous cells are part of our body, they prove hard for our immune system to distinguish from healthy cells. In treating cancer, doctors have several options. Surgery or radiotherapy is usually the start, to simply remove or target localised cancerous cells. If they have spread throughout the body, then chemotherapy is necessary: basically “nuking” the body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs target cells that divide quickly to stop tumours growing, but this means they also kill off healthy cells in hair follicles, the stomach lining and bone marrow. It’s a blunt and barbaric intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immunotherapy is a more targeted approach: its aim is to prime the immune system to attack only cancerous cells. Most of the research efforts here have focused on developing targeted vaccines and drugs for specific cancers, which means a long and expensive process of testing for safety, efficacy and dosage. But what appears to happen with mRNA vaccines is something different: it looks as if they activate the immune system in general, and this helps the body fight cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US looked at the medical records of patients with stage 3 and stage 4 lung cancer treated between 2015 and 2022 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Of those, 180 patients had received a Covid mRNA vaccine – either Pfizer or Moderna – within 100 days of starting immunotherapy treatment. In this observational study, the researchers compared them with 704 patients who had the same drugs but did not have the Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After controlling for age, disease severity and other confounding factors, the results were striking: vaccinated patients lived a median of 37.3 months compared with 20.6 months in the unvaccinated group. Three years after starting treatment, 55.7% of vaccinated patients were alive compared with 30.8% of those who weren’t. A similar pattern was found when looking at a second group of patients with metastatic melanoma (a skin cancer that has spread around the body). The same benefit was found regardless of whether it was Pfizer or Moderna, but not in non-mRNA Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The gains are significant and far beyond the norm for most cancer drugs. A study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333065/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reviewing the clinical impact&lt;/a&gt; of 124 new cancer drugs approved by the US FDA between 2003 and 2021 found that, on average, new drugs increased median overall survival only by 2.8 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To delve deeper into these findings, scientists studied the impact of mRNA vaccines in mice. They found that pairing an mRNA vaccine with immunotherapy helped activate the immune system and turn previously hidden (“cold”) tumours into recognisable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What could explain this? The researchers suggest that mRNA vaccines act as a flare, activating immune cells throughout the body. This doesn’t directly target cancer, but primes the immune system to be more alert and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these findings are confirmed in other studies, this could revolutionise how cancer is treated. As &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/study-finds-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-sparks-immune-response-to-fight-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Elias Sayour,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and a co-author of the study, said: “We could design an even better non-specific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all patients.” Because Covid mRNA vaccines have already been tested for safety in millions of people, researchers see potential in repurposing them as a low-risk, inexpensive way to boost the immune system alongside traditional cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Matters of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"matters-of-opinion","successDescription":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The findings come from an observational study – that is, looking back at medical records of patients, rather than one designed from the ground up to test this effect – meaning it can show association, not causation. Randomised control trials (or RCTs) are needed to confirm whether it is indeed the vaccine making the difference. Animal studies are also needed to further examine the exact biological mechanism beyond just general immune system activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just imagine having more precise and effective cancer treatments without the heavy toll and side-effects of chemotherapy. I remember my father suffering through round after round of chemo and wondering if the cure was worse than the disease. The Nature study is a reminder that science often advances in surprising ways. The mRNA Covid vaccines may not only have saved lives during the pandemic – they might also save lives from cancer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiber is essential for gut health as it feeds the "good" bacteria in the gut microbiome. Chavda-Sitaram aims to eat &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-30-plants-a-week-gut-health-easier-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;30 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day, which is in line with UK government dietary guidelines (the FDA recommends 28 grams of fiber per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet high in fiber, as well as healthy fats and antioxidants, can also help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-anti-inflammatory-gut-health-dietitian-eats-weekly-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in many skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema. "Fibre in your diet has been shown to help with skin improvements," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram eats plenty of leafy greens and sprout shoots each day, which are good sources of fiber and other nutrients. "You can add them to your stews, soups, or you can pop them in your smoothie," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For breakfast, she eats a fiber-rich granola made of nuts and seeds with yogurt or kefir, a fermented milk beverage, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7584df56-5353-4ed5-b3e6-f1a887f24794" data-toc-id="7584df56-5353-4ed5-b3e6-f1a887f24794"&gt;Prioritize whole foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram tries to cook with whole rather than ultra-processed foods, as they tend to be more nutrient-dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-processed-food-expert-tips-for-avoiding-the-worst-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;A diet high in UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, which are generally defined as foods that contain ingredients you wouldn't find in a regular kitchen, such as emulsifiers and colors, has been linked to many health problems, including type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Evidence suggests that certain additives can change the makeup of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always tell my kids to choose things that are just one ingredient when you go to the supermarket, so get your fruits and vegetables and always read the back and make sure that you know exactly what they're putting in," Chavda-Sitaram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="369957d0-552e-4c1a-b30c-76b859b36a37" data-toc-id="369957d0-552e-4c1a-b30c-76b859b36a37"&gt;Avoid refined sugar&lt;/h2&gt;

Refined sugars like corn syrup and table sugar have a different effect on the body to sugars found in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sources like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, because they don't contain fiber or healthy fats, which help keep blood sugar levels stable. Over time, too many spikes can lead to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of sugar is linked to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, but there's also some evidence to suggest it impacts our skin. A 2022 systematic review published in the journal JAAD International found a "modest yet significant" link between a diet high in refined sugar and acne, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to have that slice of cake when you want it. What I try to do is keep things away from home," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram applies moisturizer, vitamin C serum, and retinol daily, but said that unless you're leading a healthy lifestyle too, topical products aren't going to give you the glow you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

Healthy control samples were sourced from patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery (uninvolved tissue) or stoma reversal.

Additional FFPE blocks were obtained from the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (ethics: 23–131 bp).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Sample collection, handling and processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-thickness resection tissue samples, surplus to clinical needs, were obtained by the operating surgeon, who identified involved and uninvolved tissue macroscopically. Pathology was confirmed through clinical histopathology reports. Samples were stored in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin, and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and transported to the laboratory on ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissue samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) and examined for anatomical landmarks. Blunt dissection was performed on ice to isolate full-thickness (FT), submucosa (SM) and mucosa (MUC) layers. Following dissection, samples were immediately preserved in CryoStor CS10 (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent digestion following the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For FFPE sections, tissues were oriented in cassettes, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde (VWR International) for 48 h, and transferred to 70% ethanol before being processed through a graded alcohol series for paraffin embedding. FFPE blocks were stored at −20 °C for long-term use until required for histological staining, immunohistochemistry or ST experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Cell isolation, staining and sorting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full thickness tissue samples were dissociated into single-cell suspensions for scRNA-seq using optimized protocols for epithelial and lamina propria (LP) fractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Epithelial cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epithelial cell dissociation was performed by adapting previously described protocols&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Parikh, K. et al.

In brief, cryopreserved FT or MUC tissue samples were thawed for a minute in a 37 °C water bath then washed in 15 ml of supplemented DMEM before centrifugation. Tissue samples were cut into small fragments followed by further centrifugation. Samples were incubated in pre-warmed chelation medium (HBSS (Lonza) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin, HEPES, FCS, 5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen) and 2 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher)) for 20 min, vortexed periodically, and then centrifuged to isolate crypt-containing supernatants. The chelation protocol was completed a total of two times to increase yield of isolated crypts. Recovered crypts were digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) and DNase (Sigma) for 30 min to achieve a single-cell suspension, filtered through 70-µm and 40-µm filters to remove debris, and counted for viability. Between 0.5 and 1 million highly viable cells per sample were taken forward for cell staining. Cells were incubated with TruStain FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min at 4 °C, to block non-specific binding. Cells were then stained with a cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) antibody mix (CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD45RA, PD1, CD103, CD56 and CD3, each at 1:100) (BioLegend), to identify and exclude any contaminating immune subsets or intra-epithelial lymphocytes and also stained with hashtag-oligo (HTO) antibodies at 0.75 µl per 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per 100 µl staining volume (BioLegend), for 30 min at 4 °C. After staining, cells were immediately spun down, and resuspended at the desired pooling concentrations prior to loading on the 10X Chromium platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;LP fractions were isolated using an optimized Miltenyi Biotech LP Dissociation Kit protocol tailored for FT ileal tissue. Cryopreserved samples were rapidly thawed and dissected into small fragments and resuspended in buffer L (DMEM (high glucose), FCS and HEPES). Tissue fragments underwent digestion at 37 °C for 2 h, with periodic mechanical dissociation using a blunt needle and syringe. Following digestion, single-cell suspensions were filtered through a 100-µm filter, washed with DMEM followed by centrifugation and counted to ensure high viability prior to further processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For staining and sorting, single-cell suspensions were incubated with antibody panels targeting markers to identify immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (1:100)) and stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (1:50)) populations following TruStain FcX (BioLegend) blockage. TruStain FcX was added at 5 µl per 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 100 µl staining volume. Additional CITE-seq and hashtag antibodies were used, as above, to enable multiplexing for scRNA-seq. DAPI stain (1:1,000) just prior to FACS sorting for live-dead differentiation. Flow cytometry (BD LSR II) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria III and BD FACSAria Fusion (BD FACS Diva Software), BD Biosciences) were employed to enrich cell populations. The accuracy of sorting gates was confirmed using compensation controls generated using single colour controls and fluorescence minus one samples. Live cells sorted into stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) subsets were collected in Eppendorfs containing FCS and immediately spun down, counted, resuspended and pooled prior to loading onto the 10X Chromium platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;LeviCell-based stromal cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LeviCell platform (LevitasBio) offered an alternative method for stromal enrichment. In brief, FT tissue samples underwent both epithelial crypt chelation and LP digestion. LP-derived single-cell suspensions were then stained with respective hashtag-oligo antibodies, counted and pooled in desired one-to-one ratio. Levitation buffer and CD45 depletion beads were added to the stained LP-derived single-cell suspensions per the manufacturer’s instructions (1004001). The suspension was loaded into the LeviCell-1.0 system, which employs paramagnetic levitation to separate cells based on viability. Live stromal cells (crypt-depleted (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)) were enriched from the top output well, and dead and CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were removed via the bottom output well. The isolated stromal fraction was directly processed for scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Droplet-based scRNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based scRNA-seq was undertaken using the 10X Chromium Single Cell platform in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics, 5’ v1.1 chemistry, CG000208, Rev F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30,000–40,000 cells were loaded per pool. The workflow involved encapsulating individual cells within gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, reverse transcription of complementary DNA (cDNA) within GEMs, cDNA clean-up, amplification, and library construction for gene expression (GEX) and antibody-derived tags (ADT) data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance sequencing quality and depth, the workflow was modified by incorporating Jumpcode CRISPRclean Single Cell RNA Boost Kit (KIT1018 v1.0, Jumpcode Genomics). Post-ligation clean-up of GEX libraries included CRISPR RNA depletion using the Cas9–single guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex. This step targeted unaligned reads, highly expressed ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, and non-variable genes for depletion. Following this, library construction proceeded in line with the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library quality and integrity were assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer TapeStation to ensure compliance with sequencing requirements. Final libraries were pooled at a 4 nM concentration and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500/550 (High Output v2.5, 150 cycles) or outsourced to a NovaSeq PE150. Sequencing depth and run parameters followed the specifications provided by the manufacturer (CG000208, Rev F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Spatial transcriptomics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five to ten 5-µm scrolls were sectioned from each FFPE tissue block and stored at −80 °C for RNA quality assessment. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE Kit (73504) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Pico Assay (Agilent), which quantified DV200 values. Samples with DV200 values above 50% were considered suitable for ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All FFPE blocks were stained with H&amp;amp;E to evaluate tissue morphology and pathology representation. Only samples meeting both RNA quality and tissue morphology criteria were selected for spatial gene expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Visium FFPE protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample preparation workflow for 10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression (CG000408 and CG000409 rev. D) was followed, with specific optimizations. FFPE blocks were stored at −20 °C, slide drying time was extended to 48 h at room temperature, and deparaffinization and alcoholic rehydration steps were modified to minimize tissue detachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ST experiment, 5-μm sections were placed onto Visium FFPE spatial GEX slides, which feature 4 capture areas (42.25 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each) containing 5,000 gene expression spots per area. Tissue sections were deparaffinized, stained with H&amp;amp;E (imaged using a Zeiss AxioScan at 10× and 20× magnifications), and de-crosslinked. Tissue digestion, gene-specific probe hybridization and cDNA synthesis were performed directly on the slide, incorporating spatial barcoding, per the Visium protocol (CG000407, rev. D). cDNA quantification via qPCR (KAPA SYBR FAST) informed the number of DNA amplification cycles. Libraries were then constructed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library quality was verified using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and concentrations were measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). Libraries were pooled at 4 nM, with sample proportions adjusted based on the ratio of tissue section area to capture area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (High Output v2.5, 150 cycles) with the following run parameters: read 1 (28 cycles), i7 index (10 cycles), i5 index (10 cycles), and read 2S (50 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Xenium FFPE in situ protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides for Xenium in situ were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. In brief, FFPE tissue blocks were sectioned at 5-μm thickness and placed on Xenium slides with a capture area of 235 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (CG000578, rev. C). After drying, sections were deparaffinized and de-crosslinked (CG000580, rev. C) to facilitate probe hybridization. Custom-designed Xenium probes were hybridized to the tissue overnight, followed by probe ligation and annealing of rolling circle amplification primers. Sequential washing steps were performed to minimize autofluorescence and nuclei were stained with DAPI for imaging (CG000582, rev. E). Imaging was conducted using the automated Xenium Analyzer (CG000584, rev. E) which identified transcript counts through unique optical signatures for each gene. Transcripts with quality scores (Q-score) exceeding 20 were retained for downstream analysis. Cell boundaries were initially defined using DAPI images (see ‘Computational analysis’ for cell segmentation details). Xenium Prime analysis was carried out as above, with the addition of cell boundary staining per the user guide (CG000749, rev. B).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Xenium run, slides underwent H&amp;amp;E staining (CG000613, rev. A) to enable direct alignment of gene expression data with histological information from the same tissue section. H&amp;amp;E slides were imaged at 10× and 20× magnifications using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Histopathological characterization and validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Histopathological analysis and annotation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ST analysis, corresponding digitized H&amp;amp;E images were reviewed. Two gastrointestinal pathologists (M.V. and E.F.) independently examined the slides with limited prior knowledge of patient clinical status. Manual annotations captured cellular details, pathology and tissue architecture. Both pathologists reviewed the same slides, and minimal inter-observer variability was observed, ensuring robust assessments. A comprehensive review of the formal histopathology report, including macro- and microscopic details, supplemented the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Haematoxylin and eosin staining&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µm) were placed on Superfrost slides (Avantor) and dried. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Sections were stained with modified Harris haematoxylin (Sigma) and eosin Y solution (Sigma), with staining durations adjusted for optimal colour development. After air-drying, slides were mounted using Leica mounting medium and coverslips. Stained sections were digitized at 10× and 20× magnifications using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Immunohistochemistry&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µm) were mounted on Superfrost slides and pre-heated at 60 °C for 1 h. Slides were deparaffinized in 100% Histoclear and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed in pH 6 or pH 9 buffer (EnVision FLEX, Dako) using a Decloaking Chamber. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and non-specific binding reduced using 2.5% horse serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides were incubated with primary antibodies (F3, pH 6 1:250; TWIST1, pH 6 1:800; CD45, pH 6 1:50) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with Flex Buffer (Dako), slides were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and washed again. Peroxidase activity was visualized using DAB substrate (Dako), and slides were counterstained with haematoxylin for nuclear detection. Following washing, slides were dried and mounted with Leica Mounting Medium. High-resolution images (20× magnification) were captured using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Collagen fibre staining and imaging&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFPE sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized through a standard xylene and ethanol series to water. They were incubated with Picrosirius Red (HB6179) for 60 min at room temperature. Once excess was blotted off, slides were washed twice in 200 ml 0.5% acetic acid solution for 1 min each, followed by 100% ethanol washes for 4 min each. After dipping in Histoclear, slides were covered with micromount medium and coverslip. Imaging was performed at 40× magnification on a Zeiss Axioscanner (brightfield imaging). Polarized light imaging was performed on an Evident VS200 slide scanner (polarized light illumination), using a 40× 0.95 NA air objective lens, with an iDS VS-264C colour camera. An automated stage was used to tile and stitch images of tissue sections using the VS200 ASW software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Quantitative PCR validation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA from FFPE tissue blocks of fistulating CD patients and controls (CD, non-CD and healthy individuals) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Reverse Transcription Master Mix (1006300, Standard Bio). TaqMan assays (Thermo Fisher) were pre-amplified, diluted, and used for qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fluidigm Flex Six IFC workflow (1006308) was employed for high-throughput amplification and target detection. Samples and assays were loaded into the IFC, followed by thermal cycling on the HX controller using the GE FlexSix Fast v2 protocol. Post-run data analysis was performed with Fluidigm Real-Time PCR software (68000088). GAPDH and HPRT1 served as endogenous controls, and gene expression was calculated using &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; values. All assays were run in duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Primary colonic fibroblast derivation and culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary colonic fibroblasts were isolated and expanded from endoscopic biopsies obtained from healthy donors using the Lamina Propria Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec 130-097-410). In brief, biopsies were cut into 1–2 mm fragments and washed in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX Supplement, pyruvate (Gibco #39166-021) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Gibco #15690-056) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma P0781). To remove epithelial cells, tissue fragments were incubated 3 times in HBSS (Gibco 14025-050) containing Pen/Strep, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher 15575-038), and 2 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher P2325) at 37 °C for 5 min each, with vortexing between incubations. This process was repeated 3 times in total (cumulative incubation ~45 min) and the remaining tissue fragments were used for stromal cell isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each digestion, tissue fragments were incubated in enzyme mix prepared according to the Lamina Propria Dissociation Kit instructions at 37 °C for 15 min, repeated 3 times. Between incubations, the tissue was mechanically dissociated using a blunt-end needle to facilitate digestion. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 1× ITS (Gibco 41400-045), and seeded into 6-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and medium was changed every 2–3 days. Cells were passaged using TrypLE Express upon reaching confluency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Lentivirus production&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentiviral expression vectors for TWIST1 and OSR2 were obtained from F.

The empty vector was generated by excising the insert from the lentiviral vector using NheI-HF (NEB R3131S) and SpeI-HF (NEB R3133S) restriction enzymes, followed by gel purification and self-ligation of the linearized vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEK293 cells were obtained directly from ATCC (CRL-1573), authenticated by the supplier, and tested mycoplasma-free. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin One day prior to transfection, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells were seeded into T25 flasks. Transfection was performed the following day at 90–99% confluency. For each flask, 3.4 µg of the expression plasmid, 2.6 µg of psPAX2 (Addgene 12260), and 1.7 µg of pMD2.G (Addgene 12259) were transfected using 8.75 µl of Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher L3000015), 7.5 µl of P3000 reagent, and 1.25 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco 31985070). Culture medium was replaced 5 h post-transfection. Viral supernatant was collected 48 h later, filtered through a 0.45-µm PVDF membrane, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Lentiviral transduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transduction, primary fibroblasts were cultured to confluency in T25 flasks and incubated with an appropriate volume of lentiviral supernatant. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Puromycin (Thermo Fisher 15490717), which was refreshed every other day. Cells were passaged after seven days of selection. Lentiviral titres were estimated by transducing cells with three different volumes of virus and assessing cell viability following three days of complete Puromycin selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining and quantification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary human colonic fibroblasts were cultured in 8-well µ-Slides (ibidi 80826). Following removal of the culture medium, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher J19943K2) for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma T8787) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA (Cell Signaling Technology 9998) and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking solution: anti-Collagen VII (Abcam ab198899, 1:100) and anti-α-SMA (Dako M0851, 1:400). Cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, DAPI (Thermo Fisher D1306), and Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher A22287). Cells were washed with PBS and mounted with Surgipath Micromount Mounting Medium (Leica 3801731). Samples were imaged with a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope and images were analysed using FIJI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification, approximately five images were acquired per condition to ensure sufficient cell numbers (&amp;gt;150 cells per condition). Maximum-intensity &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-projections were generated for each fluorescence channel (Col7A, α-SMA and phalloidin), followed by thresholding and measurement of total signal intensity across the entire field of view. DAPI staining was used to identify nuclei and count cells using a standard FIJI workflow (contrast enhancement, Gaussian blur, thresholding, watershed segmentation, and particle analysis). Signal intensity for each marker was normalized to cell number, and for each patient, the normalized signal intensity in OSR2- or TWIST1-overexpressing conditions was calculated relative to the corresponding control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Quantitative PCR&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted from cultured primary fibroblasts using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN, 73034) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher 4374966). Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan assays (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Bulk RNA-seq&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted from cultured primary fibroblasts using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN 73034) and submitted to Novogene for bulk RNA sequencing. Library preparation and quality control were performed by Novogene, targeting 50 million 150-bp paired-end reads per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section rehydration, antigen retrieval and blocking FFPE tissue sections were baked overnight at 60 °C and then rehydrated using the automatic slide processor Gemini Autostainer (Epredia/Shandon Diagnostics) by serial incubation for 5 min twice in each 100% xylene, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and finally PBS. Subsequently, tissue slides were incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min and washed twice with PBS for 5 min. Antigens were retrieved using the NxGen decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical), wherein slides were heated to 110 °C for 4 min in pH 6 citrate buffer (S1699; Agilent or H-3300-250; Vector Laboratories) at 6.1 PSI then cooled to 100 °C over 16 min, rinsed in deionized water and transferred into a pH 9.0 Tris-EDTA buffer (12.1 g Tris base, 3.7 g EDTA, 1 ldistilled water) cooling from 100 °C to 85 °C over 20 min. Slides were then allowed to cool to room temperature and washed twice in PBS. Tissue sections were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin (A7906; Merck Life Science) and 10% donkey serum (C06SB; Bio-Rad) in PBS. Afterwards slides were washed twice with PBS, submerged in 1 mg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of DAPI (D357; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently again washed twice in PBS. Mounting medium combining 50% glycerol (G5516; Merck Life Science) in PBS was then added to the sections and the slides covered with no. 1 glass coverslips (Leica Microsystems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iterative imaging, staining and dye deactivation slides were imaged using the Cell DIVE system (GE Research) through iterative rounds of staining with fluorescently labelled antibodies and deactivation of the fluorophores. Initially, entire slides were scanned to select the ROIs, then the selected regions were scanned to acquire the tissue-inherent autofluorescence signal. Subsequently, coverslips were removed by incubation in ice cold PBS and the sections incubated for 2 h at room temperature with three primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin and 10% donkey serum in PBS underneath a polycarbonate coverslip (Grace Bio-Labs). In the initial round primary antibodies were detected using fluorophore-labelled cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies raised in donkey (Thermo Fisher Scientific)—in all subsequent rounds primary antibodies directly conjugated to fluorophores were used. Fluorophores with excitation maxima around 488 nm, 555 nm and 647 nm were used, dependent on the antibody either Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 (all Thermo Fisher Scientific) or CF 488 A, CF 555 and CF 647 (all Biotium). The stained slides were then washed twice in PBS, stained with DAPI and re-mounted as above. The selected ROIs per slide were then again scanned on the CellDIVE, and the autofluorescence signal previously acquired was removed from the signal of the staining round. The fluorophores were deactivated by de-coverslipping slides, washing them twice in PBS and incubating them at room temperature 3 times for 15 min in 0.1 M NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at pH 11.2 (S6297; Merck Life Science) with 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (216763; Merck Life Science) with intermittent incubation in PBS for 5 min. After dye inactivation, slides were again incubated with DAPI, mounted and scanned as above to acquire the background anew. Subsequently, slides were stained with primary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores and imaged as in the first round. This background-staining-deactivation cycle was repeated until all markers had been acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary antibodies were either purchased conjugated to fluorophores as indicated or conjugated with either the Mix-n-Stain Antibody CF488A/555/647 dye Labelling Kits (92233, 92234 and 92238; Biotium), the Alexa Fluor 488/555/647 Antibody Labelling Kits (A88062, A88065 and A88068; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or with a combination of the oYo-Link Thiol Antibody Reagent (AT3001; AlphaThera) and CF 488A maleimide, CF 555 maleimide and CF 647 maleimide (all Biotium). For the Mix-n-Stain and the Alexa Fluor kit conjugation followed manufacturer instructions, for the AlphaThera oYo-Link thiol kit, per 1 μg of antibody 33 pmol of oYo-Link thiol reagent and 155 pmol of maleimide-fluorophores were used. The oYo-Link thiol reagent was mixed with the maleimide-fluorophores in PBS and incubated at 37 °C on a heat block (Thermomixer comfort; Eppendorf) shaking for 2 h at 600 RPM in the dark. Subsequently, the resulting fluorophore-linked oYo reagent was mixed with the antibody and crosslinked to it for 2 h using 365 nm UV light at 4 °C (LED photo-cross-linking device AT8001-D; AlphaThera). Finally, one part of the conjugated antibody mix was diluted with two parts of PBS-based antibody stabilizer (131 050; Candor Bioscience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Computational analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Raw sequencing data processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All raw sequencing data were converted from BCL to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq (v.2.20.0.422) software.

The thresholds were determined per cell lineage basis from thresholding the empirical distributions after an initial clustering solution, as for instance epithelial cells typically contain higher percentage of mitochondrial UMIs than other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following cell QC for each pool, cells were demultiplexed using hashing antibody counts matrices as follows. Non-hashing antibodies and tags absent from any given reaction were filtered out from the counts matrix. Counts matrices were normalized using centred log ratio transformation. Counts were clustered using clara &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mediods (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = number of samples + 1). The 99th percentile of a negative binomial distribution fit was defined as a positive threshold for each antibody tag. Doublets were identified as cells positive for multiple tags and filtered out from further analysis. Given sufficiently large number of samples in each pool, the majority of doublets will be heterotypic due to random mixing and therefore this approach enables robust, experimental label driven doublet removal. Cells which could not be confidently assigned to a sample label were also filtered out from further analysis. Demultiplexed cells were visualized as &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-SNE embeddings and sex-specific gene expression (for example, &lt;i&gt;XIST&lt;/i&gt;) was further examined to ensure the cells were segregated correctly as expected with sample-of-origin assignments and patient meta data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All samples were merged using R package Seurat (v.5.1.0)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Hao, Y. et al.

For MERC score, we assessed both universal cell-type markers, as well as scores focused on problem areas in intestinal tissue specifically. These included T cells and B cells, which form dense aggregates in follicles and therefore are difficult to segment and epithelial cells and T cells, where intra-epithelial lymphocytes wedged in between epithelial cells are often segmented as part of the nearby epithelial cells. MERC gene sets used are provided as part of Mendeley Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Xenium ST clustering analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell by gene counts matrix following cell re-segmentation was converted into Seurat R object for further analysis. Very small cells, which likely represent segmentation artefacts, and cells with very few detected transcripts (&amp;lt;15 per cell) were filtered out from further analysis. Cells with higher than expected (&amp;gt;99th percentile) negative probe signal were also filtered out from further analysis. As the remaining cells formed a prohibitively large dataset (&amp;gt;7M cells in total), undertook a sketch-based analysis workflow, as implemented in Seurat R package. In brief, for each tissue section, we sampled 5,000 cells using the LeverageScore method to select most informative cells. Data from the sketched subset cells was then dimensionality-reduced using PCA, followed by slide integration using Harmony, as described before. Nearest-neighbour graph was constructed for downstream clustering analysis and clusters were visualized using UMAP embeddings. The remaining cells from the full dataset were then projected onto the sketched data and onto the sketched UMAP model representation using ProjectIntegration and ProjectData functions. All subsequent analyses and statistics were computed on integrated dataset from all slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low resolution clusters were annotated as broad cell-type lineages based on marker gene expression and label transfer of scRNA-seq reference data onto the sketched dataset. Each broad lineage identified (such as epithelium, fibroblasts or T cells) was then subset and further sub-clustered to identify cell subsets, which were similarly annotated as before. In the case where clusters were identified by our Xenium panel markers that did not have a one-to-one relationship to a scRNA-seq reference cluster and/or our panel did not contain subtype-defining markers, we annotated clusters based on their cell lineage combined with most specific gene marker expression (for example, &lt;i&gt;SPP1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages, &lt;i&gt;NOS2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; epithelium).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Xenium ST cell niche detection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell niche detection was performed using an unsupervised approach implemented as part of the spamsc R package (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc"&gt;https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc&lt;/a&gt;). Initially, for each field of view within the ST dataset, the spatial coordinates of cell centroids were extracted to determine the nearest neighbours for each cell, with the number of neighbours set to 30. Utilizing these coordinates, two separate neighbour matrices were constructed for each cell: (1) expression counts of each cell’s nearest neighbours were aggregated, generating a cell-by-gene matrix that encapsulates the local transcriptomic environment; and (2) cell types, as defined by high-resolution cell subclusters from previous analyses, in each cell neighbourhood were counted and aggregated into a cell-by-cell-type matrix that encapsulates the local cell-type neighbours for each cell. This process was iteratively applied across all slides and the matrices were merged. To identify tissue niches, unsupervised clustering of the neighbourhood matrices was used by first carrying out PCA (for gene expression matrices only), integrating the principal components using Harmony across different slides and detecting niche clusters using Louvain clustering. Niches were labelled according to their location, tissue architecture features or cell-type enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;Xenium ST cell co-localization analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cell–cell co-localization analysis in Xenium ST dataset, the following approach was taken. First, using spatial coordinates of each cell centroid, nearest 30 spatial neighbours for each cell were determined and cell-type counts in each spatial cellular neighbourhood were aggregated. We then constructed a cell-type correlation matrix between each cell and its neighbours, representing the frequency of co-occurrence between different cell types. A separate co-occurrence matrix was constructed for each different experimental group. Cell-type co-occurrence networks were visualized as graphs, where edges of low co-occurrence (&amp;lt;0.15), as well as negative co-occurrence (that is, cells always localize away from each other—for example, muscle cells and epithelium) were filtered out. Graphs were laid out using force-directed layout and visualized using ggpraph R package (v.2.2.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Xenium ST custom panel design&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A custom 480-gene panel was designed for Xenium ST to delineate over 100 fine-grained cell types within the gut, as defined by previously published single-cell reference datasets and scRNA-seq data generated as part of this study. Additional genes from literature were included to cover cell types that are typically difficult to capture using droplet-based scRNA-seq approaches—for example, neurons and neutrophils, as well as squamous epithelium markers, a cell type that is typically not present in the intestine. Genes were expert-selected to ensure comprehensive representation across stromal, immune, and epithelial lineages while excluding highly abundant transcripts to prevent optical crowding. For each identified cell type, 5 to 10 redundant genes were incorporated to ensure cell typing robustness. The panel’s performance was iteratively evaluated by assessing its ability to reconstruct scRNA-seq clustering patterns in the reference datasets. Probe balance was further optimized using 10X online Xenium Panel Designer tool. Xenium Prime 100 gene custom add-on panel was designed using the same procedure, focusing on key missing intestinal marker genes and disease-specific markers. All custom panel designs have been provided as part of Mendeley Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;scRNA-seq meta-analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scRNA-seq meta-analysis, data were downloaded from GEO, ENA or Zenodo repositories (see Data availability). Individual datasets were initially clustered to replicate analyses from their respective studies and fibroblast clusters from each study were subset for further downstream analyses. Fibroblast cells from public datasets and this study were then merged and integrated using harmony, correcting for both between dataset differences and known within-dataset batch variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify transcriptional programmes across transcriptomic data, cNMF&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Kotliar, D. et al.

Resulting gene loadings and usage scores were used for downstream interpretation and spatial mapping of inferred programmes. To visualize the relative contribution of cNMF-derived gene expression programmes (GEPs) across cell states, we calculated per-cluster usage proportions. First, harmony-corrected cNMF usage scores (that is, per cell factor loadings) were integrated into the Seurat metadata. For each annotated cell cluster, average usage scores were computed per factor. GEPs with low average usage (&amp;lt;0.05) were excluded to reduce noise. Remaining average scores were normalized within each cluster to sum to one, yielding relative proportions per GEP. These proportions were visualized as pie charts, with all non-disease cluster associated GEPS collapsed into an ‘other’ category for ease of visualization. All visualizations were generated using ggplot2 with coord_polar() for circular layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cNMF factors derived from meta-analysis were then applied to Xenium in situ 5100-plex dataset, calculating activity scores for each cell in the spatial dataset. Furthermore, cells from a diabetic wound-healing dataset&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 37" title="Theocharidis, G. et al.

Separately, cNMF factors were similarly calculated for fibroblast cells from Xenium in situ 5100-plex dataset, and reciprocally applied to the scRNA-seq meta-analysis to cross-map gene expression programmes identified with these different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Xenium spatial autocorrelation analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify gene pairs with spatially correlated expression patterns, we used two approaches. Firstly, local spatial neighbourhood gene expression matrices were computed as described in ‘Niche analysis’ and gene–gene Pearson’s correlation was calculated to detect co-localization gene expression patterns regardless of cell type. Additionally, for each gene pair, we also calculated a bivariate Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; statistic, which quantifies how the spatial distribution of each gene related to that of another. Statistical significance was assessed by permutation testing, in which the spatial positions were repeatedly randomized to generate a null distribution of Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; values. The resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for multiple testing, and significant positive or negative bivariate Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; values indicated spatially co-expressed or contrasting gene pairs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;scRNA-seq spatial projection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial projection of fibroblast scRNA-seq data was carried out using the spamsc R package workflow (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc"&gt;https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, to project single-cell fibroblast data onto a Xenium spatial dataset, we first identified genes shared between the scRNA-seq fibroblast dataset and the Xenium data, removing any features not expressed in either dataset. After merging these filtered datasets into a single Seurat object, we normalized and scaled them, then applied Harmony to batch correct for differences between the single-cell and spatial modalities. We extracted a reduced dimensional embedding and used a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest-neighbour approach to map fibroblast single cells onto the Xenium slide. For each fibroblast cell in the single-cell dataset, we searched for neighbouring Xenium spatial cells in the integrated reduced space; if spatial fibroblast cells were among the top neighbours, the spatial coordinates of the closest such neighbour were assigned to that cell. The accuracy of this mapping was assessed by comparing gene expression patterns between projected fibroblasts and the local spatial environment, using correlation analyses and evaluating enrichment of known fibroblast markers. These methods were applied using SPAMsc functions MergeDatasets and RunProjection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec52"&gt;Xenium cell adjacency-dependent gene expression analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess how a given cell type’s gene expression patterns differ depending on the identity of its neighbouring cells, we implemented a procedure that aggregates gene expression counts based on spatial adjacency. First, we extracted cell centroid &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for each tissue section. For each section, a nearest-neighbour graph was constructed using Euclidean distances between cell centroids, and for each cell, the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest neighbours were identified. We then focused on a particular cell type or group of cell types—for example, only epithelial cells, or FAS cells. Cells not belonging to the target identity group were excluded by zeroing out their counts. The expression values of the selected gene set (from a specified spatial assay) for the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest neighbours of each cell were then summed, yielding a ‘niche expression matrix’ that represents the aggregated gene expression within local neighbourhoods populated by the specified cell types. By applying this process across multiple images and combining the results, we obtained a matrix that captures how gene expression in a cell of interest changes when it is surrounded by different cell populations. The aggregated niche expression matrix was then filtered to remove cells which do not have any cells of the selected cell type in their local neighbourhood. Gene expression counts of the remaining cells were then normalized and subjected to downstream differential expression analyses to quantify gene expression differences conditioned on spatial adjacency to particular cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec53"&gt;Distance gradient-based analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fistula edge gradient-based analyses, fistula were selected where the tract was clearly delineated, with samples excluded where the edge of the tract was not fully captured. Fistula tract edges were then manually annotated using interactive XeniumExplorer software and coordinates of the polygonal annotations were exported as csv files. These were imported and converted into sf polygon objects. Then for each tissue section, centroid coordinates of tissue-detected cells were extracted, converted into spatial features, and distances to the nearest polygon edge were computed using st_distance() from the sf package. These distances were added to the Seurat metadata and visualized using ImageFeaturePlot().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For downstream analysis, cells were grouped by cell type and donor (slide ID), and kernel density estimates of cell abundance as a function of distance were computed independently per donor using the density() function in R. To summarize across donors, mean densities were calculated at each distance point, and standard errors were estimated as the standard deviation of densities across donors divided by the square root of the number of samples per group. These were visualized as mean ± standard error using geom_line() and geom_ribbon(). To identify genes with expression patterns that vary as a function of distance from fistula edges, we modelled gene expression counts using negative binomial generalized additive models with distance as a smooth spline term. For each gene, significance of the distance effect was assessed by comparing the full spline model to a null model using likelihood ratio test. These tests were carried out within lineage—that is, distance varying genes were identified in fibroblasts and macrophages separately by subsetting these cells individually. Genes with significant spatial associations were visualized using heat maps, plotting loess-smoothed gene expression over distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epithelial-edge distance-based analyses were carried out as above, except starting from manually annotated epithelial edges and excluding all non-epithelial cells from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec54"&gt;Picrosirius red image analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual images were first processed in Qupath software (v.0.5.0). In brief, tissue-covered areas of each slide slides were first selected as ROIs, with areas containing imaging or tissue artefacts filtered out. A groovy script was then used to systematically partition and export image tiles of defined size (512 × 512 pixels) with partial overlap (64 pixels), with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for each image tile exported along the image for downstream processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All subsequent image analyses were then performed in Python (v.3.9). All analyses were conducted using skimage for image processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="van der Walt, S. et al. scikit-image: image processing in Python.

For each image, the red colour channel was extracted, pixel intensities were normalized to 0–1 range and uniform global thresholds of 0.15 and 0.18 for all images were set for red channel binarization, after initial exploratory analyses with Otsu’s thresholding to guide parameter settings. The red channel image was then binarized at the two thresholds for parallel analyses, with the higher threshold excluding less well stained, sparser collagen bundles. Following binarization, we undertook morphological pre-processing of each image tile with erosion and opening using skimage.morphology operations to remove small specs of noise and smooth the collagen structures. Following pre-processing, each binarized tile was skeletonized using skimage.morphology.skeletonize, producing one-pixel-wide paths representing the collagen bundle backbone structures. Small, spurious branches were pruned. The resulting skeleton was used to compute several morphological and structural metrics as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Length and thickness: connected components in the skeleton were first identified using skimage.measure.label and their perimeter approximations were used as a proxy for collagen length distribution. This yielded total length, mean length and selected quantiles (5th, 50th and 95th) as features for each tile. Thickness was estimated by calculating Euclidean distance transform with scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt on the binary mask and extracting the distance values along the collagen skeleton. Total, mean and quantile values for each image patch were calculated as features.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Connectivity and morphological descriptors: the number of connected components within the skeleton was used to calculate collagen network connectivity in each image tile. We also calculated perimeter-area ratio, eccentricity (shape elongation) and average elongation (major/minor axis ratio of fitted ellipses) using skimage.measure.regionprops.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Fractal and textural measures: fractal dimension was estimated using a box-counting method across multiple scales. Lacunarity, a measure of textural heterogeneity, or ‘gappyness’, was computed at four different box sizes for each image patch. Additionally, Shannon entropy, which can provide a measure of image complexity, was calculated using skimage.measure.shannon_entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Anisotropy and orientation: anisotropy was calculated from the image patch skeletons by calculating the variance in the orientations of the skeleton segments. Anisotropy measures the overall directional coherence of the network; that is, how parallel each segment is to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Mean free path and collagen fraction: a mean free path along both collagen regions and regions between collagen areas was estimated by computing pairwise distances between feature points. To compute the total collagen fraction, the proportion of thresholded pixels at both thresholds used was calculated for each image path.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All metrics were mapped to &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; spatial coordinates of the image patches for further spatial analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For image clustering analysis, a variational autoencoder was trained on exported image tiles, integrated with a pretrained VGG16 encoder as a feature extraction backbone. In brief, a custom image tile generator class was implemented to load and preprocess image tiles to resize, normalize intensities and apply gamma correction. The generator also computed Shannon entropy for each tile to determine sample weights to reduce the weights of any texturally uninformative tiles (for example, edge tiles) during training. For VAE architecture, the encoder consistent of an initially frozen VGG16 network pretrained on ImageNet to extract robust feature representations, followed by a fully connected layer and two dense layers producing the latent parameters with a latent dimensionality of 64. A sampling layer generated latent vectors from these parameters. The decoder employed a series of transposed convolutional and up sampling layers to reconstruct the original image resolution from the latent space. The entire model was compiled with a mean-squared-error loss and trained until convergence on total of 301,941 image tiles. 64 dimension latent vector was then extracted for each image tile and used as input for Louvain clustering (resolution – 0.3). Clusters were intersected with morphological and structural tile metrics calculated as described above, and annotated on the basis of average collagen density per cluster, with highly fibrotic tissue regions annotated as ‘very high’ clusters and tissue regions with lower levels of collagen deposition (such as mucosa) as ‘low’ or ‘mid’ regions. Comparative analysis of relative cluster abundance between fistulae and control samples were carried out using sccomp R package, as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Fibroblast lineage prediction analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;pySCENIC was used to reconstruct transcription factor regulons for fibroblast cell subsets specifically and cell-by-AUC matrices for each transcription factor were imported into R for further processing. Transcription factor activity scores were scaled and used as input for dimensionality reduction by PCA. Fibroblasts cells from healthy control samples were grouped into broad fibroblast subtypes -Stromal 1–4 subsets and served as a reference dataset, while all other cells, including fistula-associated fibroblasts, were then classified with respect to the reference using Seurat’s label-transfer workflow (FindTransferAnchors and TransferData). For each query cell, a prediction probability was calculated on the basis of transcription factor regulon activity score embeddings, scoring the cell as most similar to each of the four main fibroblast subtypes, Stromal 1–4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56"&gt;Pathway enrichment analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses for both scRNA-seq and ST data were conducted using the clusterProfiler R package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Yu, G., Wang, L.

Gene identifiers were mapped with the org.Hs.eg.db (v.3.19.1) annotation DBI package (v.1.66.0). Individual cluster marker sets and differentially expressed genes were analysed for overrepresentation, using all expressed or detected genes as the background reference. Hypergeometric &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for multiple testing through the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The enrichment results were visualized with clusterProfiler and ggplot2 packages. For pathway activity analysis at the single-cell or spot level, pathway scores were derived as gene module scores using the AddModuleScore function in the Seurat R package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec57"&gt;Visium ST clustering analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw UMI count matrices output by 10X Spaceranger pipeline, corresponding images, spot coordinates, and scale factors were first imported into R for further processing. The spot matrix was filtered to retain only spots that overlapped with tissue. To assess background signal, we fitted a negative binomial distribution to the total UMI counts of spots located outside tissue sections. Using this distribution as a reference, we further removed any tissue-overlapping spots whose UMI counts were indistinguishable from the non-tissue background, as these likely represented areas of under-permeabilization. Most spots removed via this procedure were either section-specific anomalies or associated with tissue artefacts. Additional tissue irregularities (e.g., folds, tears) were annotated based on H&amp;amp;E images, and the corresponding spots were also excluded from the downstream analysis manually. Spots under coverslip air bubbles, however, were retained, as these defects affected only the H&amp;amp;E image and not the underlying tissue integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, raw UMI counts were normalized using SCTransform, a regularized negative binomial regression-based method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Hafemeister, C. &amp;amp; Satija, R.

Subsequent clustering analysis was performed using the Louvain algorithm at a resolution of 0.5, and results were visualized using UMAP. Clusters were visualized on H&amp;amp;E images with a spot size scaling factor of 1.6. The resulting integrated clusters were compared to those derived from individual slides to confirm that no biologically relevant heterogeneity was lost after batch correction. In addition, we ensured that corresponding tissue regions across slides converged into the same integrated clusters, confirming successful alignment of equivalent anatomical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58"&gt;Visium ST cell-type deconvolution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visium ST cell-type deconvolution was carried out using R package CARD&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 75" title="Ma, Y. &amp;amp; Zhou, X.

In fistula samples, ROIs were annotated as granulation tissue, lesion, lesion edge or fibrotic zone, in order to be consistent with ST region definitions. Cell segmentation was performed in QuPath software (v.0.5.0) using DAPI for nuclear detection and expansion of cell boundaries by 5 µm to approximate full cell outlines. Mean marker intensity was then quantified per cell. To enable cross-sample comparison, intensities were clipped at the 95th percentile within each sample to exclude high-intensity outliers. Cells were binarized as positive or negative per marker based on sample-specific thresholds, and the proportion of marker-positive cells was calculated per region and compared across samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec62"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09744-y#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:34:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE15aXpxUTdObGVXaW04X1BrQ0hHNjFHc21vNTlPMHZvZUc4YlM1NkdZd3lIdkVvV21Fc3M5NGFlazVZclFtRm1WVVcxRWFYQldGNWJHR3FXUzY0X09zeXh3</guid></item><item><title>细胞溶质乙酰辅酶A是控制有丝分裂的信号代谢产物-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09745-x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9"&gt;Mouse studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type C57BL/6 male mice (6–8 weeks of age) were purchased from BIKAI. &lt;i&gt;Nlrx1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;−/−&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were purchased from Cyagen. NSG mice were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center. All mice were housed in the specific-pathogen-free animal facility of Fudan University with the following environmental parameters: temperature maintained at 21–25 °C, relative humidity at 45–65% and a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mice were randomly separated into each experiment group. Mice were fasted from 10:00 for 24 h with free access to water without food. PBS or HC (59847, Sigma-Aldrich; 100 mg per kg) was intraperitoneally injected into mice at 10:00 for 4 h. For acetate administration, mice were fasted for 24 h and PBS or sodium acetate (S5636, Sigma-Aldrich; 1 g per kg) was intraperitoneally injected 10 h and 1 h before mice were euthanized. For serum collection, mice were fasted overnight for 16 h with free access to water. For food reintroduction, mice were fasted for 24 h and then re-fed for another 24 h. Mice were euthanized and the indicated tissues were collected for subsequent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the KPC model used in the MRTX1133 therapy experiment, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; KPC cells were subcutaneously injected into 6- to 8-week-old NSG mice. The vernier calliper measurements begun when the tumours reached around 200 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Tumour volume measurements were recorded three times per week using the formula 0.5 × length × width&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

We interpret these results to suggest that, despite uneven sequence acquisition across time, the diversity of sampled sequences roughly reflect the amplitude of H5N1 cases. Given these results, we opted to use sequencing data for the entire sampling period for broad inferences on introductions and geographical spread, but supplement these analyses with controls for sampling differences between groups. For more-intensive reconstructions of transmission patterns between wild birds, commercial poultry and backyard birds, we focus on the initial 6-month period with the most densely sampled data, coupled with experiments to assess the impacts of sampling on results. Finally, although we retained data from Canada and Central America for all subsequent analyses, our results are probably most informative about transmission within the USA due to the heavy skewing of data towards the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;AVONET database&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We downloaded the AVONET database for avian ecology data and merged it to available host metadata from GISAID for each sequence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Tobias, J.

We inferred the history of changes from a given trait to another across branches of the phylogeny, providing a rate of transitions from A to B per year for each pair of trait states. When reporting these results, we refer to state A as the source population/state and B as the sink population/state. We implemented the BSSVS, which enables us to determine which rates have the highest posterior support by using a stochastic binary operator which turns on and off rates to determine their contribution to the diffusion network. In addition to the discrete trait diffusion rate, we used a Markov Jump analysis to observe the number of jumps between discrete states across the posterior set of trees and estimated the Markov rewards to determine the waiting time for a given discrete trait state in the phylogeny&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Minin, V.

The Markov reward proportion is calculated as the proportion of the phylogeny at a given time being a given discrete state. By looking at the proportion of a given state over time across the phylogeny, we can provide a proxy for how long transmission has occurred in each group between transition events. We calculate the transition rate as a realization of the CTMC process by dividing the number of Markov jumps by the tree height (branch length from the earliest tip to the root of the tree), and separately, by tree length (sum of all branch lengths). For each pairwise transition rate, we calculate the level of BF support that the given rate has. The BF represents the support of a given rate, and is calculated as the ratio of the posterior odds of the given rate being non-zero divided by the equivalent prior odds, which is set as a Poisson prior with a 50% prior probability on the minimal number of rates possible&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Lemey, P., Rambaut, A., Drummond, A.

We then sampled 916 sequences uniformly across these categories and inferred transitions between these regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Host order analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We classified sequences by host taxonomic order, inferring the host species using designations in the strain name and/or metadata to match species records in AVONET&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Tobias, J.

To ensure that each discrete trait had an adequate number of samples for the discrete trait analysis of host orders, we combined orders in two instances based on taxonomic and behavioural similarity. The order Falconiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14), representing falcons, was added to Accipitriformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 363), which includes other raptors such as eagles, hawks and vultures. Pelecaniformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 34), including pelicans, were grouped with Charadriiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 74, shorebirds and waders) due to their similar aquatic lifestyles and behaviours. Mammals were kept as a broad non-human classification as most samples were of the order carnivora (foxes, skunks, bobcats), apart from samples of dolphins (Artiodactyla) and Virginia opossum (Didelphimorphia). The following orders were omitted due to a low number of sequences: Rheaforimes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2), Casuariiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1), Apodiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2), Suliformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7), Gaviiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1), Gruiformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1) and Podicipediformes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discrete trait approaches assume that the number of sequences in a dataset are representative of the underlying distribution of cases in an outbreak, resulting in faulty inference when this assumption is violated&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Erdelyan, C.

To account for differential sampling among these host order groups, we considered two distinct subsampling approaches. The first is a proportional sampling regime in which sequences are sampled proportional to the detections in each host group each month. This common sampling regime assumes that case detections in each group are the closest proxy for the case distribution in the outbreak, and attempts to align sampling with underlying model assumptions. However, this approach may not be appropriate if case detection is heavily biased between groups. For HPAI H5N1 in North America, detections in wild birds are primarily identified when humans report sick or dead birds to wildlife health authorities or wildlife rescues (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;), which may skew detections towards birds with dedicated rescue services or birds that reside in closer proximity to humans. For example, Anseriformes and raptors comprised 50.2% and 20.3% of all sequences, respectively, which could arise from high case intensity or a higher rate of case acquisition. A second, complementary subsampling approach is to sample sequences equally, meaning that sequences are sampled from each group in perfectly equal numbers. By forcing the number of sequences from each group to be equal, the transmission inference must be driven by the underlying sequence diversity in each group rather than by sampling differences. Given the high variation among detections within each host group, we opted to pursue both sampling regimes and focus on results that were concordant in both. We first performed an AI test to confirm that clustering was sufficient for discrete trait inference (Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Next, for each regime, we performed three independent subsamples, where the dataset was sampled either proportional to cases or equally. For the equal sampling regime, each dataset included 100 randomly sampled sequences per host group, except for Passeriformes, for which only 57 sequences were available. To account for variation across subsampled datasets, we combined the results for the three independent subsamples to summarize statistical support (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Owing to similar tree topologies across replicates, we visualized the phylogeny of the dataset with the highest posterior support (equal order subsample 1) in the main text and make the results of all analyses available in supplement (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, to measure the effects of potential sampling bias on the inferred transition rates, we performed a modified tip-shuffle analysis. We generated 100 datasets in which the host tip assignments were randomly shuffled, re-inferred the host group at internal nodes and infer a mean root state probability for each host across the 100 shuffled datasets. We then compared the root state probability in the empirical data to that inferred in the shuffled data as a measure of the impact of sampling on the results as previously described (see the ‘Tip-shuffle analysis’ section for further details)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="Edwards, C.

We repeated this random subsampling three times, resulting in three separate datasets. For the proportional sampling regime, we performed three subsamples of sequences based on the proportion of detections in each host order group, which were collected between 4 November 2021 and 11 August 2023. Three random proportional samples were taken each with the following number of sequences for each group: Accipitriformes (133), Anseriformes (342), Passeriformes (12), non-human-mammal (16), Galliformes (83), Charadriiformes (40), Strigiformes (29) (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 655 sequences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Migratory behaviour analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined discrete traits for use in discrete trait diffusion modelling based on the available sequence metadata and merged AVONET data. In addition to taxonomic order, we defined migratory behaviour. Birds were classified as sedentary (staying in each location and not showing any major migration behaviour), partially migratory (for example, small proportion of population migrates long distances, or population undergoes short-distance migration, nomadic movements, distinct altitudinal migration) or migratory (the majority of population undertakes long-distance migration). We subsampled sequences based on migratory behaviour including non-human-mammals and domestic birds to create a subsample of 500 sequences with equal sampling across behaviour groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Rationale for inclusion of turkeys as domestic birds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While commercial turkey operations represent 53.7% of all detections on commercial farms&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Patyk, K.

However, epidemiological data suggest that most deposited turkey sequences probably stem from domestic outbreaks. Among case detections during the study period, only 139 were reported in wild turkeys, representing 1.5% of all wild bird detections. By contrast, commercial turkey outbreaks comprised 28.5% of all domestic detections in the study period, suggesting that unlabelled turkey sequences are most likely to have come from domestic birds. While these data are not conclusive, we opted to perform an additional analysis to determine whether our exclusion of turkey sequences (that are most likely domestic) may have biased our results. In the analyses detailed below, turkeys are assumed to be domestic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Domestic/wild titration analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of sampling of wild birds on the estimation of rates between domestic and wild birds, we created five separate datasets with varying numbers of wild birds for sequences collected between 2021 and 2023. We randomly sampled 270 domestic sequences and 270 wild sequences as the initial 1:1 ratio dataset. We then made four more datasets increasing the number of wild sequences by a factor of 0.5 (adding 135 wild sequences), resulting in a final titration of 1:3 domestic to wild sequences (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,080). We applied a two-state asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model in which sequences were labelled as domestic or wild. All priors and model parameters selected are the same as those described in the empirical tree set description above. To study the impact of the inclusion of turkeys in the transmission between domestic and wild populations, we annotated all unannotated sequences collected from turkeys as domestic (see the rationale in section above). We then created three datasets starting with 525 domestic and 525 wild bird sequences, adding 263 sequences to successive titrations resulting in 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2 (domestic:wild) sequencing datasets with a final titration size of 1,575 sequences. We again applied a two-state asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model in which sequences were labelled as domestic or wild, and all priors and model parameters selected are the same as those described in the empirical tree set description above. To determine whether the proportion of turkeys to other domestic birds would impact the results of the previously described titration analysis we built a dataset in which the domestic bird group had equal numbers of turkey and domestic (non-turkey) sequences. This dataset included 173 turkey, 173 domestic bird and 692 wild bird sequences, totalling 1,038 sequences. Given that turkeys comprised 53.7% of commercial poultry outbreaks in the study period, this sampling regime conforms to both equal and proportional sampling regimes. We applied an asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model using a BSSVS for a three-trait model with the following states: wild birds, domestic birds (not turkey) and turkey. We performed three independent runs of this analysis using the models and parameters described in the empirical tree analysis section above. All titration replicates were performed using an MCMC chain length of 100 million states sampling every 10,000 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Commercial, backyard, wild-bird titration analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metadata and annotated sequences were made available describing sequences as being from backyard birds for sequences collected in early 2022 which distinguished them from commercial poultry (previously all sequences being determined domestic)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Youk, S. et al.

This program assesses the phylogenetic structure of discrete traits across viral lineages using three metrics: the AI, parsimony score (PS) and maximum monophyletic clade size (MC). The AI measures the imbalance of internal nodes of a phylogeny for a given set of traits. The PS calculates the number of state changes in the phylogeny. The MC measures the maximum number of tips belonging to a monophyletic clade for each discrete trait of interest. These metrics are calculated for the phylogeny as tips are randomly swapped to create a null distribution to compare against. Taken together, these metrics quantify the degree of clustering within the phylogeny, with lower AI and PS values indicating stronger phylogenetic structure, suggesting that closely related taxa tend to share the same trait, whereas higher values indicate weaker structure and more-frequent transitions between trait states. Statistical significance was assessed by comparing observed values against a null distribution generated through randomization, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values reported for each test. All discrete trait groupings showed evidence for clustering by trait, supporting the use of trait modelling across the tree.

As originally developed, a tip swap analysis attempts to assess the impact of trait sampling on discrete trait measurements. An operator is implemented within the MCMC chain that randomly picks pairs of tips and swaps their trait values, thus generating a posterior set of trees among which pairs of trait assignments have been randomly swapped. The probability of each state at the root is then computed, and compared to the inferred root state probabilities in the empirical data. As the root state probabilities in randomized datasets should primarily reflect the frequency of each trait in the analysis, empirical results that differ substantially from this null distribution are interpreted as evidence that the sequencing data are informing the analysis beyond what is expected based on trait frequencies alone. Thus, traits for which the root state probability differs considerably from the root state probability in the null data are frequently interpreted as being informed by the data, rather than sampling bias. While this approach has been shown to perform well on small phylogenies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Lee, D.-H. et al.

In our flyways dataset, which includes around 1,000 tips, we found that, even with extremely high operator values (4,000), the traditional tip-swap analysis resulted in a posterior set of trees in which the majority of tips (93.3%) remained assigned to their true state at least 50% of the time, resulting in a null dataset that was only partially randomized. We believe that this is due to the high number of tips in our analysis, resulting in only an extremely small fraction of tips randomized at any given step in the MCMC chain. To overcome this limitation, we instead performed a randomized tip-shuffle analysis. Using the empirical set of trees inferred for each discrete trait analysis, we generated 100 null datasets in which we shuffled the trait assignments randomly across the tips. In this approach, we preserve the phylogenetic tree topology and the ratio of samples from each group, but shuffle their assignments at the tips. For each discrete trait analysis, we generated 100 distinct shuffled versions of the empirical trees, reran the analysis and summarized the resulting posterior distribution by inferring a maximum clade credibility tree. We then computed the root state probabilities for each trait for each MCC tree, and computed the mean root state probability across all 100 replicates. This computed mean is reported in Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, in the column labelled ‘mean root state probability across 100 datasets with randomly shuffled tip states’. We then compared the root state probabilities in the empirical data (reported as ‘root state probability in empirical data’ in Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) to the shuffled data as a measure of the impact of sampling on the results. As expected, the root state probabilities inferred in the shuffled datasets are proportional to the number of sequences included for each group. For the analyses using an equal sampling regime (migration, flyway, host orders equal and initial titration tests), this leads to approximately equal expected root state probabilities across groups. By contrast, the root state probabilities in the empirical data generally differ significantly from expectation, suggesting that the phylogenetic results are informed by the genetic data rather than from sampling alone. The results of tip shuffling analyses for each discrete trait in this study are provided in Supplementary Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:31:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1QaFJHTVlnSVBxVUkxWUtDRzJPeTZsNHJOckRkVzNSWUgxaWxEc09Ka2pqNXV2dmp4SzNqbnl5ZUVkRDh0enJoVlI0YWtUM21zTjlHX3Jwd3BJM2l1SDcw</guid></item><item><title>减少食盐摄入的4种方法-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/well/lower-salt-intake.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE16N0dMVXZzRkJrdDNTUFNRY0wtRjBPUERTMEhnX180R0JjVnNhSjBmREVtcDRONkhodVBBTXBEYmlONkVYZ2swbVJjcTlPOTFSaVVNdGRxbjFiaXhPbXh1cUUxSDFyVXpVWGZJelJLRQ</guid></item><item><title>我从不希望我的孩子指责我对我的钱不公平。但在这一系列项目上，我恐怕不得不这样做。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/money-advice-can-you-be-fair-between-kids.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhv1l78i001tpwksmo3xa1hv@published"&gt;So many people resent their parents for a lack of “fairness.” How do you handle “fairness” situations with your children when the circumstances are both similar and completely different? I have three kids, “Anna” (27), “Ben” (25), and “Caroline” (22). In most ways they received resources comparably growing up, but now unevenness is rearing its ugly head.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5n29u000m3b77x8oebagu@published"&gt;My company pays for the employees’ health insurance and then the employee can add (and pay for) additional insurance, including for kids. “Kids” insurance costs the same if you have one kid or six kids. When Anna and Ben graduated college and started working, I kept them on my insurance because I was already purchasing the “Kids” insurance for Caroline. Anna switched to her own insurance at 26 and Ben will be 26 soon and do the same. Caroline now has a full-time job with benefits, including insurance. Her insurance is not free, but costs significantly less than “Kids” at my company. I never had a stated plan to insure my children until they were 26—it just worked out that way for my older children and didn’t cost me any additional money. But it’s clearly a benefit they received courtesy of me that Caroline won’t receive.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5meu7000d3b77zq1ue6wb@published"&gt;So what’s fair/even? Birth order just is, and there are perks and disadvantages to all the spots? Caroline should get a subsidy from me to help with her insurance, even though I didn’t spend any extra money on her siblings? Just let it play out because no one can say who will need help with something else along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mezj000g3b77sg9l8bf7@published"&gt;Fairness doesn’t mean you have to do the exact same thing for all of your adult children. Support comes in different shapes, and for Anna and Ben, it just made sense to handle insurance the way you did. It didn’t cost you extra, so it wasn’t intended as preferential treatment. Caroline’s situation is different, and that’s just a matter of timing and how the plan is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mf1e000h3b77ucah5a7w@published"&gt;No, you don’t need to somehow make up for this by paying for Caroline’s insurance, especially if it’s something that she easily afford herself. Life is not this transactional, and there are plenty of other ways you can offer and show support—financial or otherwise—when she needs it. Over the years, each of your kids is going to have a different need. One of them might want to go to grad school. One of them might have kids and need childcare. If you spend all of your time keeping track of who gets what and trying to even it out with the others, you’ll drive yourself nuts. But what you can do is commit to being equitable over the long run. You’ll help each of your kids when it makes sense, when it’s within your means, and in ways that fit their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

Emphasize that you’ll continue to support all three of them when real needs arise, even if the form of help looks different.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is based on a conversation with retired academic-turned-artist Robert Fishman, 73, of Potomac, Maryland. He reflects on life with his 97-year-old mom. The account has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother was officially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/my-dad-was-diagnosed-with-dementia-hes-slipping-away-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diagnosed with dementia&lt;/a&gt; two-and-a-half years ago at the age of 95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult for both her and me. She'd always been a beautiful, vibrant woman, and we've been very close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's had a challenging life, particularly after being widowed when my father died at just 45, and her second husband died of Parkinson's disease 26 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's now 97 years old, and her longevity is making me question my own mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9798cc89-eb64-492b-ae5a-88d63ad787b5" data-toc-id="9798cc89-eb64-492b-ae5a-88d63ad787b5"&gt;Mom drove until she was 92&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was extremely vivacious and independent, working in sales and volunteering at a hospice and a museum. Her friends relied on her to take them to appointments because she drove until she was 92.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sadly, that all changed when I noticed some big changes.

Please send details to jridley@insider.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife, Jackie, and I had a hard time persuading her to move closer to us in Maryland. But she relented. She now lives in another assisted living place located about two miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1cb40c1e-3ccd-4d71-8fac-aa6e7710fb9c" data-toc-id="1cb40c1e-3ccd-4d71-8fac-aa6e7710fb9c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She often mistakes me for my dad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visit her every other day. I won't sugarcoat it by saying it's a pleasant experience. She doesn't recognise who I am — frequently mistaking me for my dad — and can be violent at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are strict rules, and the staff can't shower her without either Jackie or me being there, in case she lashes out or gets bruises.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The situation isn't unique, but it's unusual to have a parent who is still alive when you are 73. I'm aware that I am in the last stage of my life. It's a constant reminder when people you know die in their 70s. I've already lost several friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start thinking about life and death in a different way. Luckily, my wife and I are healthy at the moment, but I increasingly reflect on my own mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bc190f78-9b1b-4280-8be9-55d07d7dd45a" data-toc-id="bc190f78-9b1b-4280-8be9-55d07d7dd45a"&gt;I would want to make a decision before my dementia became advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find dementia to be a horrible disease that is playing out before our eyes. Watching someone you love struggle is something I wouldn't wish on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I develop something like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/alzheimers-vs-dementia" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's or Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, if it gets to the point where dementia is setting in, I would prefer to be able to make an early enough decision not to live anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

The population is aging, and I'm writing a children's book to help young kids navigate this issue. It's called "Bubby's Still Here" because "Bubby" is a traditional name for grandma in Jewish culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.facebook.com/thecabinstudioinLinden" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;immerse myself in my art.&lt;/a&gt; I've developed the concept of deconstructed landscapes, which relates to the idea of memory loss.

Despite measurable progress in diagnosis, treatment and innovation, persistent challenges in funding and equitable access to care threaten to reverse hard-won gains in the global fight against TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Declines in the global burden of TB, and progress in testing, treatment, social protection and research are all welcome news after years of setbacks, but progress is not victory," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "The fact that TB continues to claim over a million lives each year, despite being preventable and curable, is simply unconscionable. WHO is working with countries to build on the progress they have made and accelerate the path to ending TB by 2030.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Global progress and success stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2023 and 2024, the global rate of people falling ill with TB declined by nearly 2%, while deaths from TB fell by 3%. These reductions signal a continued recovery of essential health services following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regions and countries show sustained progress, demonstrating that strong political commitment and investment address this ancient disease. Between 2015 and 2024, the WHO African Region achieved a 28% reduction in the TB incidence rate (number of people falling ill with TB per 100 000 population per year) and a 46% reduction in deaths. The European Region saw even greater declines, with a 39% drop in incidence and a 49% reduction in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the same period, over 100 countries achieved at least a 20% reduction in TB incidence rates, and 65 countries achieved reductions of 35% or more in TB-related deaths. These countries have attained the first milestones of the &lt;a href="/teams/global-programme-on-tuberculosis-and-lung-health/the-end-tb-strategy"&gt;WHO End TB Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ending TB globally will require accelerated progress in countries with the highest burden. In 2024, 87% of the global number of people who developed TB disease was concentrated in 30 countries. Just eight of them accounted for 67% of the global total: India (25%), Indonesia (10%), the Philippines (6.8%), China (6.5%), Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3.9%) and Bangladesh (3.6%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major advances in TB diagnosis and treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timely treatment for TB has saved an estimated 83 million lives since 2000. Between 2023 and 2024, progress continued in TB diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, reflecting the impact of sustained efforts and innovation in countries. Key achievements include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2024, 8.3 million people were newly diagnosed with TB and accessed treatment, representing about 78% of the people who fell ill with the disease during that year;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The coverage of rapid testing for TB diagnosis increased from 48% in 2023 to 54% in 2024;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment for drug-susceptible TB remained highly effective, with a success rate of 88%;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of people developing drug-resistant TB each year has been declining with over 164,000 people receiving treatment in 2024. The latest data show an improvement in the treatment success rate, to 71%, up from 68% the previous year;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2024, 5.3 million people at high risk of TB received preventive treatment, up from 4.7 million in 2023.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Social protection and multisectoral action key to address the drivers of the epidemic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, WHO has reported on progress toward the social protection target established at the second UN High-Level Meeting on TB in 2023, using data compiled by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Among the 30 high TB burden countries, social protection coverage remains highly unequal, ranging from 3.1% in Uganda to 94% in Mongolia. Notably, 19 countries report coverage rates below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also highlights data on the major risk factors driving the epidemic such as undernutrition, HIV infection, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol use remain. Confronting these drivers, alongside structural determinants such as poverty, requires coordinated multisectoral action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Funding gaps endanger progress and research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite many gains, global progress levels remain far from meeting the End TB Strategy targets. A major obstacle is global funding for TB, which has stagnated since 2020. In 2024, only US$5.9 billion was available for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment--just over a quarter of the US$22 billion annual target set for 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuts to international donor funding from 2025 onward pose a serious challenge. Modelling studies have already warned that long-term cuts to international donor funding could result in up to 2 million additional deaths and 10 million people falling ill with TB between 2025 and 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global TB research funding also lags, reaching only US$1.2 billion in 2023 (24% of the target). As of August 2025, 63 diagnostic tests were in development and 29 drugs were in clinical trials--up from just 8 in 2015. Additionally, 18 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials, including 6 in Phase 3. WHO continues to lead global efforts to advance the TB vaccine agenda, supported by the TB Vaccine Accelerator Council launched by WHO Director-General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at a defining moment in the fight against TB,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis and STIs. “Funding cuts and persistent drivers of the epidemic threaten to undo hard-won gains, but with political commitment, sustained investment, and global solidarity, we can turn the tide and end this ancient killer once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO calls for sustained political commitment, increased domestic investment, and intensified research to accelerate progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My friend Emma has a spreadsheet tracking every book she's read since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows exactly how many pages she read each month, which genres dominated each year, and can tell you her average star rating for any author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's never mentioned this to anyone at work. Never posted about it online. Never brought it up at parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stumbled onto it accidentally while we were sharing screens during a video call, she laughed and said, "Oh, that. Yeah, I just like keeping track."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked why she'd never mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because the second I do, it becomes a thing people have opinions about. Someone will ask why I'm not on Goodreads. Someone else will want to compare numbers. It stops being mine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I realized something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart introverts don't hide their hobbies because they're ashamed. They protect them because they understand that some things lose their magic when they're performed for an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hobbies that matter most are the ones that exist purely for you, in the quiet spaces where no one's watching and no one's keeping score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Keeping detailed personal records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma's book spreadsheet isn't unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know introverts who track their coffee consumption, log every concert they attend, catalog their plant growth, or maintain decade-long journals about their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't productivity hacks or self-improvement projects. They're personal archeology. Ways of paying attention to your own life that don't make sense to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started keeping a running list of every meal I cook. Not recipes. Just the names of dishes and the date I made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned it once at dinner, someone immediately asked, "Why? What's the point?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn't have a good answer. Because the point is that there is no point. It's just something I do because I like having a record. Because it helps me notice patterns. Because it makes me feel connected to my own history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Creating elaborate fantasy worlds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for writing projects or D&amp;amp;D campaigns. Just for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who's been building a fictional city in their head for fifteen years. They have maps. Political systems. History. Family trees for characters who will never appear in any story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked why they don't write a novel, they said, "Because I don't want to. I just like thinking about it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds odd to people who only create things meant to be shared. But for introverts, the act of imagining can be its own complete experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My version of this is designing hypothetical restaurants. Full concepts with menus, floor plans, staff structures, and seasonal specials. I've never worked in a restaurant. I have no plans to open one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on long walks or before falling asleep, I think about how I'd organize the kitchen, what the signature dish would be, how the space would feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a sandbox for my brain. A place where I can control every variable and explore ideas without the friction of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Mastering obscure skills nobody asked for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met someone at a party who could identify most birds by their calls. Not because they're a birder or work in environmental science. Just because they find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't bring it up. I only learned about it because we were standing outside and they casually said, "That's a white-throated sparrow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked how they knew, they shrugged and said, "I just started paying attention a few years ago."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts collect these kinds of skills quietly. Learning to identify typefaces. Memorizing the periodic table for fun. Studying old maps of cities they'll never visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no utilitarian goal. No career application. No impressive party trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the private satisfaction of knowing something deeply because it interested them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught myself to identify about forty common mushrooms. Not to forage. Just to notice. When I'm walking in the woods, I like being able to name what I'm seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never told most people about this because the first question is always, "Are you going to start foraging?" And then I have to explain that no, I just wanted to know. And that always sounds insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's the thing about introvert hobbies. They don't need to be sufficient for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Collecting things that have no monetary value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not vintage watches or rare vinyl. Things like ticket stubs. Interesting rocks. Screenshots of beautiful color combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner collects pictures of interesting doors. Just doors they see while traveling or walking around the city. Thousands of them. Organized by color and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Instagram account. No coffee table book in progress. Just a folder on their phone they look through sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone once asked what they collect, they said "nothing really," because explaining would require justifying why doors are worth noticing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts understand that some collections only make sense internally. The value isn't in rarity or investment potential. It's in the act of noticing, selecting, and keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a document where I save sentences I like. Not quotes from famous people. Just sentences from novels, articles, or overheard conversations that struck me as beautiful or true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably never do anything with them. But having them there, in a place only I visit, feels like keeping company with thoughts that mattered to me once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Developing elaborate personal systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who has a color-coded system for organizing their thoughts. Not for work projects. For everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue for things they're curious about. Green for things that made them happy. Red for things that frustrated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keep these in a private app no one else uses. It's not efficient. It's not shareable. It's just theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts love building systems that only they understand because the system itself is an extension of how their mind works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tagging system for articles I save that makes sense to no one but me. Tags like "winter feeling" or "good pacing" or "makes me want to write."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I tried to explain the taxonomy to someone else, it would sound arbitrary. But for me, it's a perfect map of my internal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems like this don't scale. They're not meant to. They exist purely as a tool for one person to make sense of their own experience, and that specificity is what makes them powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Practicing skills that will never be performed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing guitar alone in your bedroom with no intention of ever playing for others. Perfecting a recipe no one else will taste. Learning to draw but never showing anyone the drawings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't hobbies with a showcase at the end. They're practices that exist entirely in the doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been teaching myself to letter by hand. Not calligraphy for wedding invitations. Just writing out quotes or poems in careful, deliberate handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't post them. I don't frame them. Sometimes I throw them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For extroverts, this often doesn't compute. Why put in the hours if no one will see it? But for introverts, removing the performance pressure is exactly what makes the practice sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something exists only for you, you can be mediocre at it. You can plateau and not care. You can do it badly on purpose just to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a freedom in that. A kind of creative play that only exists when the stakes are private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Engaging in deep solo research on random topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for school or work. Just because something caught their attention and they want to understand it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introvert I know spent six months researching the history of parking meters. Why they were invented. How they changed cities. The politics around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't write a book. Didn't even write an essay. They just wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from the internet rabbit hole we all fall into. This is sustained, deliberate curiosity pursued over time with no external motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once spent three months reading everything I could about the history of fermentation. Not because I was starting a business or writing an article. Just because I wanted to understand how humans figured out that letting food rot in specific ways made it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research felt indulgent. I kept thinking I should be doing something more productive. But the deep satisfaction of understanding something just because I wanted to is hard to replicate in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts do this because they value understanding as its own reward. They don't need the research to lead somewhere. The knowing is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about introvert hobbies: they're not secrets because they're shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're private because privacy protects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second you share something you love, it enters the realm of judgment, comparison, and external expectation. People want to know why you do it. Whether you're good at it. What you're going to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes the answer is just: nothing. I do it because I like it. Because it's mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a video shared by @zebbythegolden, we see a quiet living room, except for the faint sound of TV and one very confused &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;. It starts innocently enough — Zebby’s humans are chilling on the couch watching TV, and he’s just standing there, staring at them like something’s gone terribly wrong. His dad’s feet are propped up on the table, but even when he moves them, Zebby refuses to budge. The in-video text says it all: “POV: My Golden Retriever being the MOST dramatic.” Clearly, the squishiest boy from Los Angeles can turn even the tiniest obstacles in life into full-blown soap operas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-won-t-climb-on-the-couch-for-a-reason-in-video"&gt;Golden Retriever won’t climb on the couch for a reason in video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With over 83.7K likes, this video has viewers howling. Zebby clearly wants to jump up and sit next to his mom, but he seems to be frozen. He is staring in disbelief as if invisible forces are holding him back. His dad coaxes him: “Come on, buddy. You can do it.” Zebby tilts his head, sniffs the air, even moves his nose toward his dad’s hand… but those paws stay glued to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after Dad pulls his legs back and encourages him, “Come on, buddy. Go ahead, buddy,” Zebby remains cemented to the ground. He stares at his dad, completely baffled that his humans do not understand the sheer, overwhelming reason for his immobility. One viewer joked, “Zebby’s like, you adopted me for my beauty, not my brains!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mom finally spots the culprit: Zebby’s collar lying on the ground near the couch. This was the terrifying object that prevented him from moving forward. Once the path is clear, Mom says “come on” one more time, and Zebby immediately moves forward. He jumps onto the couch with zero difficulty, ready to receive his well-deserved pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These drugs, which include semaglutide (sold as Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro), are already well known for helping people lose weight and manage metabolic conditions. Now, researchers have discovered that they might also be linked to better survival outcomes in colon cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed medical records from more than 6,800 people diagnosed with colon cancer across University of California Health facilities. Patients who were taking GLP-1 medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those not using the drugs (15.5% versus 37.1%). This striking difference points to a potentially powerful new use for drugs that are already transforming diabetes and obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. His team used the University of California Health Data Warehouse to review outcomes across the state's academic medical centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After accounting for important factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), cancer severity, and other health conditions, the team found that people taking GLP-1 drugs still had a significantly lower risk of death. This consistency suggests the protective benefit of GLP-1 therapy may be independent of other medical or lifestyle variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why GLP-1 Drugs Might Protect Against Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit appeared strongest in patients with obesity (BMI over 35). This finding hints that GLP-1 drugs may help offset some of the inflammation and metabolic stress that can make cancer harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for this effect. GLP-1 receptor agonists are known to lower inflammation throughout the body, enhance insulin sensitivity, and promote weight loss -- all factors that can influence cancer growth and progression. Experimental studies in laboratories also indicate that GLP-1 drugs may directly inhibit the growth of tumor cells, encourage cancer cell death, and alter the surrounding environment within tumors to make them less supportive of disease spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, researchers caution that it is still unclear whether the lower death rate seen in this study reflects a direct anti-cancer action or an indirect result of improved overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps: Clinical Trials Needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cuomo emphasized that the findings are observational, meaning they do not yet prove that GLP-1 drugs directly improve cancer outcomes. These results highlight an urgent need for clinical trials to test whether GLP-1 medications can actually enhance cancer survival, particularly among patients with obesity-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Investigation&lt;/em&gt; on November 11, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — An investigation into the loss of a privately operated methane monitoring satellite could not identify a single root cause for the spacecraft’s failure earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MethaneSAT, a mission led by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) with participation from the New Zealand Space Agency, stopped communicating in orbit in June, 15 months after its launch. The project &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/methanesat-fails-in-orbit/"&gt;formally declared the mission over July 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/31529-appendix-9-methanesat-anomaly-investigation-report"&gt;a two-page report&lt;/a&gt; released by New Zealand’s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Nov. 7, an investigation into the failure said the spacecraft malfunctioned likely because of a “solitary event” in either its avionics unit or electrical power subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the limited data available kept investigators from making a more precise determination. “While the investigation concluded that the direct cause began with or spread to one of the two identified subsystems, the specific reason for the system failure remains unknown,” the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report noted that either subsystem could have malfunctioned because of factors such as printed circuit board failure in the avionics unit, a printed circuit board or electronic component failure in a bus interface or a failure of a thruster or associated system that sent high current into other parts of the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on the limited data available, it is not possible to state the relative likelihood among these possible factors,” the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report said it could not rule out several other potential causes, ranging from an orbital debris impact to “unexpected fault system interactions,” but concluded each was significantly less likely that the other factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft itself remains intact, the report noted, based on on-orbit imaging of MethaneSAT taken in late June through mid-July. Those images, though, showed the spacecraft was not in its proper orientation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand ministry released the report as part of &lt;a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/31525-new-zealands-investment-in-methanesat"&gt;an overall report on its participation in the mission&lt;/a&gt;. The government spent $29 million New Zealand ($16.4 million) on the mission, including support for the spacecraft itself as well as mission operations centers led by Rocket Lab for initial operations of the spacecraft and at the University of Auckland that was slated to take over long-term operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government report went to great lengths to argue that it could not have prevented the spacecraft’s failure. “The technical failure, while disappointing, occurred in components outside of New Zealand’s control and within the bounds of accepted risk in space missions,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the mission had been suffering persistent technical problems since its March 2024 launch. “The satellite failure occurred in a largely, but not quite, ‘off-the-shelf’ bus, adapted for a specific purpose,” the report noted. “Some of the sub-components, such as the thrusters, had limited flight heritage and some issues did arise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One timeline of “weekly report items” in the report refers several times to technical issues with the spacecraft, starting in July 2024. “Rocket Lab managing recurring subsystem issues while testing automation to improve MSAT data downlinking,” stated one entry in October 2024, when Rocket Lab was managing mission operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rocket Lab expanded downlink scheduling despite technical challenges,” stated another entry, three weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, mission operations were moved from Rocket Lab to Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT), which built the spacecraft bus. “BCT built the satellite, and the temporary transfer will enable them to address challenges which are affecting its operation,” the government ministry stated at the time. “Operational challenges are not unusual with space missions, in this case the BCT team is best placed to manage them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, others familiar with the mission say the problems with MethaneSAT were unusual. Richard Easther, a professor of physics at the University of Auckland, said the spacecraft may have suffered effects from space weather on electronics that did not use radiation-hardened components, based on reports the spacecraft frequently went into safe mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has not been a significant increase in failed satellites during the current peak in the 11-year solar cycle, he noted in &lt;a href="https://excursionset.com/blog/2025/11/lost-in-space-new-zealands-30m-participation-trophy/"&gt;a Nov. 6 blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the mission. “But for whatever reason, MethaneSAT could not cope with the harsh but easily foreseeable environment it encountered in space.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That and other issues, he argued, suggested that EDF rushed to complete the spacecraft to meet its March 2024 launch date on a SpaceX rideshare mission. “Unfortunately, it looks as if the EDF might have compromised on quality in order to keep to some semblance of its original schedule,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

"I am so very, very grateful that it wasn't cancer, but I had to go through all of that and know this is probably never going to get any better now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It affects my work, my daily living, and at times it makes me feel inadequate as a [mom] and a wife," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hay, who works as a neonatal nurse assistant at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, is now considering early retirement on health grounds, per the &lt;em&gt;Doncaster Free Press&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hay has since pursued a clinical negligence claim with Sheffield-based law firm Medical Solicitors, and the case was resolved with a settlement, a spokesperson for the company said, per the BBC.

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many assume that combining exercise with the diabetes drug metformin delivers double the health benefits, but new research from Rutgers University challenges that assumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a 16-week trial, the study found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaf551" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;metformin actually reduced the improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in blood vessel function, fitness and blood sugar control that exercise normally provides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Metformin and exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Type 2 diabetes affects &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;~35 million people in the United States&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and prevention strategies routinely emphasize a combination of lifestyle change and pharmacotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One major contributor to diabetes and heart disease is metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat and abnormal cholesterol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise is well known to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/abstract/2019/04000/exercise_and_vascular_insulin_sensitivity_in_the.3.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;improve vascular insulin sensitivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (how blood vessels respond to insulin) and to boost aerobic fitness, both of which lower the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Enhancing vascular insulin sensitivity allows glucose to enter muscles more effectively, helping protect heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In clinical practice, many healthcare providers operate on the assumption that prescribing exercise alongside the first-line drug metformin will deliver additive benefits – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;assuming that “one plus one equals two,” said lead author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kines.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty-profile/317-full-time-faculty/1441-malin-steven-k" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Dr. Steven Malin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to emerging literature, that assumption may be flawed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;“The problem is that most evidence shows metformin blunts exercise benefits,” Malin added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although both metformin and exercise independently improve glucose regulation, prior studies suggest that taking them together &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00517.2009" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;may not enhance exercise’s effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until now, no large randomized controlled trial has tested whether metformin interferes with exercise-induced adaptations in vascular insulin sensitivity across different exercise intensities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;How metformin affects exercise benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malin and the team designed a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test how metformin might change the body’s response to exercise. They recruited 72 sedentary adults who were at risk for metabolic syndrome, and participants were split into 4 groups: low-intensity exercise with a placebo, low-intensity exercise with metformin (2 g per day), high-intensity exercise with a placebo and high-intensity exercise with metformin. Each person trained five days a week, with three of the weekly sessions supervised to keep effort levels consistent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team focused on vascular insulin sensitivity, using advanced ultrasound imaging to track blood flow through large arteries and tiny capillaries. They also measured aerobic fitness (VO₂ max) and fasting glucose and inflammation markers such as endothelin-1 and TNF-α. These measures help track how exercise and metformin affect blood sugar control, inflammation and aerobic fitness, key indicators of metabolic and cardiovascular health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise alone led to clear improvements. Blood vessels became more responsive, blood sugar control improved and fitness levels rose, regardless of whether the exercise was gentle or hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when metformin was added, these gains were sharply reduced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Blood vessel function improved with exercise training, regardless of intensity,” said Malin. “Metformin blunted that observation, suggesting one type of exercise intensity is not better either with the drug for blood vessel health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants taking metformin also failed to gain fitness or show the usual drop in glucose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you exercise and take metformin and your blood glucose does not go down, that’s a problem,” Malin said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Their physical function isn’t getting better and that could have long-term health risks,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite small reductions in weight across all groups, the data pointed to a consistent pattern: metformin appeared to dampen the body’s normal response to exercise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why metformin may limit fitness and blood sugar gains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results suggest metformin may work against some of the body’s key benefits from exercise. The drug appeared to limit the improvements in blood vessel function, blood sugar control and aerobic fitness that normally follow training – raising questions about current diabetes prevention advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One explanation behind metformin's action may lie in how it acts on the cell’s energy machinery. The drug partly blocks mitochondrial complex I, a target that helps reduce oxidative stress and lower blood sugar. But those same mitochondria are what the body relies on to adapt to exercise. Limiting their activity could dampen the cellular changes that improve endurance and metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study also found signs that metformin may disrupt the balance between nitric oxide, which helps vessels relax, and endothelin-1, which causes them to tighten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the authors acknowledge some limits. More than half of the imaging data were lost due to technical problems, and most participants were postmenopausal women, which narrows how far the results can be generalized. The study was also short-term and focused on arm blood vessels, even though participants exercised using their legs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite these issues, the findings are consistent with earlier work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Future studies should explore how to combine metformin and exercise safely and test these effects in larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We need to figure out how to best recommend exercise with metformin,” said Malin. “We also need to consider how other medications interact with exercise to develop better guidelines for doctors to help people lower chronic disease risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, it turns out gluten might not the actual culprit. Recent research published in The Lancet has redirected the blame away from gluten, and onto another ingredient behind bread‑related bloating and gas. The investigators highlight fructans-a class of carbohydrates embedded in wheat and a host of grains, as the likely issue. Fructans sit within the FODMAP family (Fermentable Oligo‑, Di‑, Mono‑saccharides and Polyols), a group of short‑chain carbs, that are often only partially absorbed, and then fermented by gut bacteria, producing the gas and abdominal discomfort many people experience. What this discovery underscores is the need to tailor diets to each individual, rather than resorting to a blanket ban on gluten. Let us learn more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What exactly are fructans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fructans are a type of carbohydrate, composed of linked units that form chains. They appear in a variety of foods-wheat, onions, garlic and even some fruits. Unlike gluten, which is a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11373345/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, fructans are fibers that largely pass through the small intestine untouched. When they finally reach the colon, gut bacteria ferment them, releasing gases such as hydrogen and methane along with short‑chain fatty acids. This fermentation can bring on stomach discomfort, and extra gas in people, who are particularly sensitive, or who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or non‑celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Bloated tummy woes? Common remedies to get rid of gas and bloating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What the Lancet study and other investigations reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, a notable randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial examined those who believed they were gluten‑sensitive, yet tested negative for disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators tested gluten and fructan effects separately, by handing participants bars that contained either gluten, fructans, or an inert placebo. The findings were striking: the fructan‑laden bars triggered gastrointestinal distress-bloating, excess gas and abdominal pain. Strangely enough, the gluten‑only bars didn’t produce symptoms any worse, than the placebo. The data suggest that, for many who hold gluten responsible for their issues, fructans might actually be the instigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why Fructans result in bloating and gas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classified as a FODMAP, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29102613/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;fructans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; draw fluid into the intestine by virtue of their pull, and once they reach the large bowel, they are swiftly broken down by resident microbes. This rapid fermentation churns out gas, causing the colon to swell. The resulting stretch can irritate the gut wall and set off nerve signaling, which amplifies the usual complaints-bloating, abdominal pain and erratic bowel movements, whether diarrhea or constipation, in people who are particularly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gluten, vs. Fructans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people point the finger at gluten when wheat‑type foods cause stomach troubles. Yet, gluten shares the stage with fructans in those foods. A gluten‑free regimen typically trims the fructan load as well, blurring the lines on which is more harmful than the other. Consequently, setting apart the real trigger, becomes a challenge. In some cases, eliminating gluten barely makes a difference, because the lingering fructans keep the system on edge. Recognizing fructan intolerance or sensitivity, offers a better-targeted dietary approach, such as limiting high-FODMAP foods rather than unnecessary gluten avoidance, which can be restrictive and nutritionally limiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Personalised meal plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this insight, dietary plans need to be individualized for individuals who have a sensitive stomach, rather than imposing a one‑size‑fits‑all gluten‑free regime. People who struggle with bloating and gas, may find a low‑FODMAP approach-one that trims fructans and other fermentable carbs, more beneficial. On the other hand, foods high in fructans, such as wheat, onions, garlic and certain fruits can be, swapped for alternatives. Enlisting a dietitian versed in FODMAP management, can shape an eating plan that eases symptoms without too many restrictions, bolstering gut health and overall quality of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5859228/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwJBVV95cUxObGpwTVZTNm1EMk10NXBKWXdHd1p2X2M2VnJwVGNTT0J3NzZ2Y1VnZG5QRklMV2ZHcGRHUGthTDdpMDE1RVZKRTFvN19fWENEa1Zta2xTZDV6N214ZWlCaWRxNXFrNUltM1Z4VWpXQWFHRy1OUS1TWTVWNEZlR0ZrS3NNdXRtaDFWc1J0czJrOW9BU1JLb0NOVFhrRU1VVVNESnhPOEd0RlhoWEc2V2p2YkkzemtjbEVTelF6SkJmTWVOUldpbXpVblM4X1dHazhVcHJfeE81RzZ4UEo4cGFLeDA2UE1PcTNfcWlYNHZmY05CT21HcTVYQzNYbVl0LVZJYWJrZ0tjMkhlaGFjSENXMzZSZw</guid></item><item><title>8种天然有助于降低甘油三酯和改善心脏健康的科学支持的食物-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/8-science-backed-foods-that-naturally-help-lower-triglycerides-and-improve-heart-health/articleshow/125269364.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High triglycerides can quietly strain your heart and overall health, often without obvious symptoms. The encouraging part is that food can be one of the strongest allies in bringing those levels down. Instead of strict diets or complicated plans, small and consistent choices, like adding more whole, unprocessed and nutrient-dense foods, can bring a lasting difference. Highly raised triglycerides may heighten the risk for heart disease, stroke, and metabolic syndrome. Below are eight research-backed foods that help lower triglycerides, supported by scientific studies and clinical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="19923746" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Omega-3-fatty-acids" source="keywords"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are found in the following fatty fish: salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring. The triglyceride-lowering effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been well-studied. Omega-3 fatty acids act in the liver to reduce triglyceride synthesis, enhance triglyceride clearance, and suppress inflammation. Regular consumption of omega-3-rich fish or supplements has been reported to lower triglycerides by 20-35%. Substantial reductions have been seen within 6 months with doses ranging from 3 to 4.5 grams daily of the two key omega-3 fatty acids called EPA and DHA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000709" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; recommends eating fatty fish at least twice a week for cardio-protective benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds are among the protective foods that are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants. Controlled studies that have replaced saturated fats with nuts have been able to show a 10-20% reduction in triglycerides, but it is highly dependent on the type of nut and amount used. Of particular note, flaxseed contains the plant omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, as well as fiber that helps lower blood lipids. A daily serving of a mix of nuts or seeds (about 30 grams) may be a useful dietary strategy, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353157/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institute of Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Whole grains and high fiber food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains like oats, barley, quinoa, and brown rice contain soluble fiber, which delays the absorption of carbohydrate foods, thereby reducing postprandial peak triglycerides. Indeed, studies have shown that increasing fiber intake is associated with reduced levels of triglycerides and an overall improvement in lipid profiles. Diets high in fiber also enhance insulin sensitivity and by extension, indirectly help regulate triglycerides. Whole grains rather than refined carbohydrates are necessary in the management of triglycerides.

The low GI of legumes prevents the sharp increases in the levels of blood sugar that, in turn, prevent an increase in triglycerides. Inclusion of legumes several times a week is advisable as the major source of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruits and vegetables&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adequate fruits and vegetables in the diet provide antioxidants, potassium, and vitamins that support lipid metabolism and reduce inflammation. Certain fruits such as berries, citrus fruits, and kiwi are very low in fructose and calories and, as such, are perfectly appropriate and recommended in managing triglycerides. Intake of fruits and vegetables at 150--225 grams per day may reduce triglycerides by 1-4%, particularly when combined with other healthy dietary changes. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745529/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745529/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, one of the best strategies to reduce triglycerides, especially in women is to increase fruit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avocado&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avocado is a source of monounsaturated fats responsible for the substitution of saturated fats in a diet and thus improves lipid profiles. Clinical studies reveal that the addition of avocado to a meal reduces triglycerides and LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL cholesterol, or good cholesterol. Among other--contents, besides fat, avocados are also carriers of fiber and antioxidants useful to the heart. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/jaha.114.001355" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adding one avocado daily to a moderate-fat, cholesterol-lowering diet further reduces LDL cholesterol, LDL particle number, showing that avocados provide heart and metabolic benefits beyond their healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthy oils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing saturated fats with healthy oils, such as extra virgin olive oil, fish oil, canola oil, and flaxseed oil, will provide monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that lower triglycerides. Moreover, olive oil contains high amounts of polyphenols, hence possessing extra anti-inflammatory properties. Diets rich in these oils have also been demonstrated to also--lower triglycerides and generally decrease cardiovascular risk. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/nutrition/research/completed-studies/fish-oil-and-triglycerides.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, all the participants who consumed fish oil experienced a significant decrease in TG concentrations and improved LDL-cholesterol levels in the body as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low-fat dairy products&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also permissible, within a heart-healthy diet, to consume low-fat or fat-free dairy products, including milk, yogurt, and cheese. They provide calcium, protein, and vitamins with minimal saturated fat content to avoid--elevating triglyceride levels.

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;Adriana Del Orden started her detransition two years ago. As a lesbian, she has no regrets about the steps she took when she was younger to live as a man. Changing her gender and body over time has made her feel, in her words, powerful and magical. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like such a power source. The transition, and then detransitioning,” she said. Del Orden is genderqueer, which means she doesn’t fit into a male and female binary. She enjoys expressing herself as a queer, masculine woman, as well as embracing her femininity. And although she is no longer a trans man, her masculinity brings her a lot of joy — especially since she was forced to repress it as a kid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While growing up in Puerto Rico and then New York City, her parents denied her anything they deemed too masculine. She wasn’t allowed to play any sports, play with certain toys or cut her hair short. She had been telling others that she was a boy since she was 7 years old, but her identity and her expression were ignored and denied. She felt miserable. Then, at 15, she learned about being transgender through Noahfinnce, a trans British singer and songwriter. At that age, she didn’t understand why a boy sounded like a girl — so she looked it up. A door was opened. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;At 20, she started hormone replacement therapy and underwent top surgery. The night before the surgery, she was at once excited and nervous. It was her first-ever surgery and it meant she could stop binding her chest and finally feel at home in her body. Working with her surgeon at Mount Sinai in New York City was comforting, especially since he showed her photos of other people of color who’d had the same procedure. That gave her a real sense of how the outcome would look. And afterwards, she felt free. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just feel like such a power source. The transition, and then detransitioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adriana Del Orden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a YouTube vlog eight months later, Del Orden said, “In the midst of all the anti-trans legislation that is being passed, I just want to say how lucky I am and privileged to not live in a state that does those sorts of things.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Del Orden, now 23, said that living in New York, a place that’s full of LGBTQ+ people, has made her detransition easier. Seeing gay couples on the street right outside her front door makes her feel safer. The LGBTQ+ community and spaces are still very much her people and her home. Her gender expression has changed, but her fundamental beliefs haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first, I did get a couple of side-eyes, but at the end of the day, I am still hanging out in the same spaces that I was hanging out before my detransition.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So it’s just like, why would I be here if I don’t like you guys?” she said. “The people closest to me did stay strong and supported me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was a lesbian before she transitioned, and she still is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both her initial transition as a trans man, and her detransition now, has brought out the people in her life who love her regardless of her gender expression, presentation or identity, she said. The whole experience set her free from others’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really don’t blame my younger self for taking the path that I did,” she said. “It taught me a lot about myself, and it taught me a lot about the world. I’ve been mistaken for a cis woman, a trans woman, a cis man and a trans man. I feel like I’ve seen it all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Del Orden graduated college as a transgender man. But shortly after her graduation, she knew that identity wasn’t right for her.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The trouble started when people began assuming that she was a cisgender man in public. With that perception came narrow expectations of what a man should look and act like — and narrow views of masculinity. More and more, she felt restricted in how she could express herself. She felt like she was being boxed in. &lt;/p&gt;


  



&lt;p&gt;“Slowly, people started addressing me as if I was a cis man. And that’s when the box started getting tighter,” she said. Her gender identity is more expansive, and less binary, than how she was being treated. Now that she presents to the world as a woman, she feels like she can wear whatever she wants. The kind of treatment she got in public as an effeminate man was much worse than how she’s treated as a masculine woman, she said. Now, she feels much more at home in her body and able to authentically be herself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These realizations, and the joy she feels in her body now, could have only happened through transitioning, she said. After taking testosterone, her voice deepened in a way that she enjoys. She sounds like a grown woman now, she said, not like the high-pitched little kid she felt she sounded like before.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her body has also changed. “I still think that I would be uncomfortable in that body, had I not taken T,” she said, referring to testosterone. “It was needed.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness has kept her grounded through her initial gender transition and her detransition. It’s been essential to fostering self-love through all the changes, she said, helping her feel in control about how she looks and how she can change her body.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She lifts weights and goes on runs every other day. In the morning, she feels euphoric to wake up in the body she has now. &lt;/p&gt;





  &lt;figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide is-cropped"&gt;
    

    
&lt;figcaption class="article-caption"&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Del Orden stopped taking testosterone almost two years ago. Initially, it was more of an accident than a decision: one day, she realized she hadn’t taken her prescribed dose in months. As she thought more about detransitioning, she went to her doctor for advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She asked the doctor, “I think I want to detransition. What can we do?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing we can do,” she recalled him answering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Del Orden was disappointed, sad, confused. “How could you so easily prescribe me testosterone and then not even put in any effort into my detransition?” she told The 19th. “I just felt like my doctor didn’t really care.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Del Orden’s struggle to find adequate healthcare happened even in a city where many physicians are knowledgeable about gender-affirming care. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644"&gt;WPATH&lt;/a&gt;), which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, says that medical providers should be prepared to support adolescents who detransition. Many detransitioners struggle to find help and feel isolated, WPATH notes in its most recent standards of care. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;cite&gt;(Sydney Krantz for The 19th)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Del Orden found other providers within the same clinic who did listen to her and gave her the care that she needed. A patient navigator helped her set up a consultation for a breast augmentation and she started estrogen-based birth control. Meanwhile, she waited for her body to adapt and look more feminine as the testosterone left her system. She began targeted workout routines to get into the kind of shape she wanted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really did not get help until I put my foot down. So I stood up for myself, basically, but it was all within the same clinic,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Del Orden started posting about her detransition on Instagram earlier this year and has since built a platform of almost 14,000 followers. She wanted to use social media to dispel myths and negative assumptions about detransition, and also just to showcase her own happiness. To her, there seems to be little to no general awareness or any acknowledgement in the media that people like her, who exist outside of the cis-heteronormative binary, can experience even an ounce of joy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life is pretty normal. I wake up, I go to work, I work out, I hang with my friends, I take trips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adriana Del Orden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Detransitioners are seen as something to pity or like, you’ve ruined your life forever. I don’t think I ruined my life forever. My life is pretty normal. I wake up, I go to work, I work out, I hang with my friends, I take trips,” she said. “I’m gonna go back to college, get my master’s. I’m working in social services.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has received a lot of love and understanding from the trans community, although she has also been met with strong negative reactions online — from both trans and cis people. As she has shared on her Instagram, detransitioners are often used as political weapons, but by no means does she want to weaponize her own story. What she wants is to showcase how she has loved her body — and herself — at every stage of life, through every step of her journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del Orden doesn’t feel represented by what the Trump administration is doing and saying about detransitioners at all. She was excited when she heard the ​​U.S. Department of Education was holding a “Detrans Awareness Day,” but when she tuned in, she was disappointed. The administration was calling for an end to gender-affirming care, not actually spotlighting the struggles of people who have detransitioned, she said. It struck her as just more transphobia and hate, something she has continued to deal with as she detransitions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No matter what you do in your gender journey, whether you take HRT or whether you just dress in different clothes, you’re going to be hated on and you’re going to be judged,” she said. “The hypocrisy just proves to me that no matter what I do, people are going to be transphobic to me. People are going to question my gender. And I just have to do me.”&lt;/p&gt;

A fridge in his garage is dedicated to storing the cases he stocks up on monthly, and he even built a shelving unit to contain the “overflow,” which he'll scoop up if there’s a special deal at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Frondorf got hooked on Diet Coke about 20 years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/first-signs-diabetes-heres-experts-100516661.html" data-ylk="slk:he was diagnosed with diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;he was diagnosed with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which forced him to replace his sugary drinks with other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The regular Coke was my soda of choice, but it wasn’t the only thing I drank,” he said. “Once I settled on the Diet Coke, it’s just gotten more over the years to the point where that’s all I drink now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Frondorf, 68, poses in front of a garage fridge full of Diet Coke in his Cincinnati, Ohio home in November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Frondorf has tried cutting back and quitting several times. But it only lasts a few days before he caves in, again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He's not alone. More than 60% of American adults report drinking sugar-sweetened beverages one or more times daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently, &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/weight-loss/articles/quit-diet-coke-soda-cold-121705733.html" data-ylk="slk:some USA TODAY journalists also learned firsthand;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;some USA TODAY journalists also learned firsthand&lt;/a&gt; how hard it can be to break soda habits when they tried to quit cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people in America love soda, and some even feel like they can't stop drinking it. And that's by design, medical experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These drinks hijack the brain’s reward and motivation system and rewire the body’s metabolism, food and nutrition experts say, which can lead consumers to crave them more. Soda lovers are also trained to associate these products with certain events and moments due to decades of intense product marketing by beverage companies, said Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, where she runs the Food and Addiction Science and Treatment lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They want to inundate every single domain of your life,” she said. “Just like a chain smoker is dosing themselves with nicotine all day, you’re dosing yourself with a naturally delivered sweet taste day after day because whenever it’s not there, a part of you feels slightly depressed and slightly dissatisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry soda lovers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sorry-soda-lovers-less-1-123418716.html" data-ylk="slk:Less than 1 can a day could cause this health problem, new study says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Less than 1 can a day could cause this health problem, new study says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;'It's just the taste'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Humans were born with a sweet tooth, Gearhardt said. The innate preference for sweetness was an evolutionary necessity for newborns to crave their mother’s milk and ultimately find nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s one of the tastes that we don’t have to learn to like," she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sweetness floods the brain with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/07/10/what-chemical-makes-you-happy/70338835007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dopamine, a neurotransmitter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dopamine, a neurotransmitter&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in the reward, pleasure and motivation. Sodas “hyperactivate” the dopamine systems and makes the brain crave it “in a way that makes them hard to resist,” Gearhardt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is something that served us, that was biologically beneficial for the vast majority of human and animal history,” she said. “It’s just now been used to sell us sugar water with a bunch of flavor additives that create brand loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decades ago, we made it the enemy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/decades-ago-made-whole-milk-110922742.html" data-ylk="slk:Some say it was a mistake.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Some say it was a mistake.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Frondorf can attest to this. He refuses to drink Pepsi products and immediately knows when he's accidentally served regular Coke instead of Diet. When asked why he loves Diet Coke so much, his answer is pretty simple: "It's just the taste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soda also contains &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known to be mildly addictive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known to be mildly addictive&lt;/a&gt;, said Vivica Kraak, associate professor for Virginia Tech’s department of human nutrition, foods and exercise. This likely contributes to withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decades of industry research and development have also led to a proprietary blend of enticing flavor enhancers that trigger other sensory reactions in our brain, forcing us to want more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;An 'insulin roller coaster ride'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's not just about how these chemical components interact with our brain, Gearhardt said. It’s also about how they’re delivered into our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The whole delivery vehicle is really what makes something addictive,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/articles/why-bananas-perfect-pre-workout-090246849.html" data-ylk="slk:a banana contains sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a banana contains sugar &lt;/a&gt;but most people don’t binge on bananas, she said. That’s because fruits are a plant matrix that also contains fiber, water and other components that require energy to break it down and nourish the body for longer periods of time. A can of soda is a straight shot of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But a sweet tooth is only secondary to what’s really going on here, said Dr. David Ludwig, endocrinologist and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Food rewards and cravings occur with any foods, not just sodas and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/29/ultra-processed-foods-health-rissk-diabetes-heart-disease/72787230007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:those that are ultra-processed,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;those that are ultra-processed,&lt;/a&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They’re there to get us to do behaviors that, if they’re done in a proper balance and in the right context, are actually helpful for us,” he said. “If we haven’t eaten for three days, we’re going to be cravings foods. That’s a natural thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sodas can be addictive but not because they’re hyper-palatable, said Ludwig, who is also a professor of nutrition at Harvard Public School and an advisor to the Coalition for Metabolic Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/22/sugar-grams-per-day/71589643007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Too many added sugars in your diet can be dangerous.

This causes the pancreas to quickly release the hormone insulin to drive that blood sugar down, forcing sugar into the liver, muscles and fat tissue throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because these calories are getting stored very quickly, they aren’t around long enough to nourish the body and your metabolism begins to crash, which causes cravings to get the body’s blood sugar back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s a double whammy because the calories are getting stored and you get hungry again too soon,” Ludwig said. “It’s not that these foods are so amazingly tasty, it’s that they alter our metabolism... (The) fundamental problem is that the processed carbs are sending us on a blood sugar and insulin roller coaster ride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Coca-Cola and PepsiCo did not respond to USA TODAY’s requests for comment, however, William Dermody, a spokesperson for the American Beverage Association, said makers of popular soda brands support people's efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle. They offer alternatives such as sparkling waters, zero-sugar sports drinks and probiotic sodas, "so families can make the choices that are right for them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Today 63% of the beverages consumers buy have zero sugar," he said. That figure, however, includes Diet Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sodas as the 'default beverage'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many soda drinkers can pinpoint the time in their lives when they first fell in love with soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s by design, said Kraak from Virginia Tech. Soda manufacturers invest billions of marketing dollars each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They cross-market with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/08/31/fast-food-cheap-meal-rising-costs-price/85784487007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain foods and fast-food chains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;certain foods and fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt;, university campuses, events, sports and alcoholic beverages. Their campaigns ensure that drinking soda is associated with every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They’ve socially normalized sugary beverages as the default beverage,” Kraak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's the case for Frondorf, who says he's not going to stop drinking soda anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’ve got a lot of health problems, and I know drinking water would help but it’s just not worth the effort," he said.

&lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization, which serves as the World Health Organization’s regional office for the Americas, made this announcement after the agency’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2024.93"&gt;measles elimination commission&lt;/a&gt; met in Mexico City to review the latest public health data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://hs.richmond.edu/faculty/kjacobse/"&gt;global health epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt; who studies the spread of infectious diseases, this change in status does not surprise me. Measles is highly contagious, and a drop in childhood vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and in other countries has left many children unprotected from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of measles in Canada after decades with very low numbers of cases &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-could-again-become-widespread-as-cases-surge-worldwide-255501"&gt;is not an isolated problem&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. has also had &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-cases-are-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-make-sure-youre-protected-252277"&gt;large outbreaks of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;, and it will likely soon lose its measles-free designation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of measles elimination status is a symptom of a deeper issue: &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/from-drew-altman/the-problem-isnt-trust-in-vaccines-its-that-people-dont-know-who-to-trust/"&gt;declining trust&lt;/a&gt; in public messaging about science and health, which has led to decreased vaccination rates and growing vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean for a country to be measles-free?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet. Before the measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination"&gt;licensed for use in 1963&lt;/a&gt;, nearly every child got measles infection and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;more than 2 million children died&lt;/a&gt; from measles each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine decreased that risk dramatically. By 1968, five years after the vaccine became available, case counts in the U.S. had &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death"&gt;dropped by more than 95%&lt;/a&gt;. Cases in Canada also &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles/health-professionals-measles.html"&gt;decreased substantially&lt;/a&gt; after the vaccine was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;about 100,000 children still die from measles&lt;/a&gt; each year even though a safe, effective and low-cost vaccine is available. Almost all of those deaths occur in low-income countries where many children do not have access to recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization uses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2622975/"&gt;three labels to describe&lt;/a&gt; how well a country is preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as measles. A disease is said to be controlled when public health interventions such as routine childhood vaccinations significantly lower the rate of new infections. A disease is considered to be eliminated from a country when the only cases that happen are small outbreaks linked to international travel. And finally, a disease is deemed eradicated only after several years of no cases occurring anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the status of measles elimination, a country must have no ongoing local transmission of the disease &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;for at least one year&lt;/a&gt;. It will lose that status if it has a chain of cases that spread from person to person for more than one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a country has eliminated measles, there is almost no risk from the disease as long as vaccination rates stay high. But when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks will soon start happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What happened in Canada?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the Pan American Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/these-doctors-helped-eliminate-measles-in-98-heres-how-they-did-it/"&gt;confirmed that Canada had eliminated measles transmission&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, the U.S. also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;gained the measles-free designation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2016, every country in the Americas had achieved measles elimination status. The region &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2024.93"&gt;lost that status in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela, and then &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles"&gt;regained it in 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01037-2"&gt;have been falling worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect communities from measles outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;about 95% of the population&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the percentage of 2-year-olds who have received at least one dose of measles vaccine dropped from about 90% in 2019 to &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;about 82% in 2022 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of unvaccinated people in the population increased, the risk of measles outbreaks grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having only 16 total cases of measles nationwide between 2020 and 2023, the number of measles cases in Canada jumped to more than 100 in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/"&gt;more than 5,000 cases in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Cases have occurred among infants, children and adults in every Canadian province in 2025, and two infants have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10% of the people who have gotten sick had been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that both the U.S. and Mexico will lose their measles-free designation in 2026, because both countries have had &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-31-fold-americas-region-year"&gt;sustained outbreaks of measles&lt;/a&gt; since early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;more than 90% of kindergartners in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; are vaccinated against measles, that rate is too low to protect communities from outbreaks. An &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/texas-records-first-us-measles-death-in-10-years-a-medical-epidemiologist-explains-how-to-protect-yourself-and-your-community-from-this-deadly-preventable-disease-251004"&gt;outbreak that started in Texas&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;infected more than 760 people&lt;/a&gt; and caused the deaths of two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,600 Americans&lt;/a&gt; in more than 40 states have gotten sick from measles in 2025. That is more cases than any year since 1992. More than 90% of the people who got sick were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico has also had &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/informe-diario-del-brote-de-sarampion-en-mexico-2025"&gt;thousands of measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, mostly among unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central America, South America and the Caribbean will retain their measles-free status for now. But the outbreaks in North America increase the risk of measles spreading to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a significant improvement in vaccination coverage and public trust in community health measures, many countries are likely to face more, and bigger, outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the coming years.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269090/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And paper doesn't catch on fire in the microwave's super-powered chamber, but should you actually put it in there, like, ever? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we don't have a grip on what is absolutely never suitable for the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microwave safe doesn't just mean a container will not melt or warp, but it also means it will not release or leach harmful chemicals into our food when heated," says Li Li, associate professor at the &lt;a href="https://www.unr.edu/public-health/people/li-li" target="_self"&gt;University of Nevada, Reno School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, whose specialty is environmental health and exposure science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with materials and health experts about what to do when it comes to exposing various kitchen containers and packaging materials to the electromagnetic radiation of your microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best practices for using containers in the microwave&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styrofoam and your microwave are a dangerous combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;GoodLifeStudio/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the specific materials and their numerous variables regarding suitability for microwave use, consider the following best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Look for microwave-safe labels only as a starting point&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some materials are generally safe for microwave use, it's still a good habit to look for a "microwave safe" indication of some kind. However, bear in mind that this designation doesn't tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/how-long-past-the-expiration-date-can-you-eat-food-an-expert-weighs-in/" target="_self"&gt;expiration dates on food&lt;/a&gt;, the microwave-safe label isn't based on a federal certification program. "Manufacturers can use it if their own testing shows it meets the microwave-safe standards in their own minds. It is a helpful guideline, but not a guarantee," Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, that label doesn't necessarily indicate any risks to human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Toss all damaged containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damaged food containers can leach chemicals into food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damaged containers can potentially lead to the leaching of chemicals or toxins in your food. They may also malfunction due to the vibration of electromagnetic waves on which the microwave's functionality relies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether a container is indicated to be microwave-safe, and regardless of the material, discard it if it's not in good condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's scratched, pitted, cracked or otherwise damaged, then you can no longer assume that it is safe to use in a microwave," says Kelly Johnson-Arbor, toxicologist for &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/" target="_self"&gt;MedStar Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don't go from the freezer to the microwave&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frozen containers, especially plastic ones, shouldn't go in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;airdone/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While moving from the refrigerator to the microwave is generally OK for most materials, you should avoid sudden temperature changes, says Li. Allowing a moment on the countertop for a glass or ceramic container can help reduce the shock once it's in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never move from the freezer straight to the microwave," Li says. "Such major temperature changes can cause cracking," which immediately compromises the food inside the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Be cautious with decorative elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you're working with a microwave-safe material, be wary of containers or bowls that have excessive decoration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterned conventional ceramics are typically fine, but "be cautious with decorative coatings or metallic trims, as they can spark or break down when overheated," Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best microwave-safe options: glass and ceramic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass and ceramic containers are generally safe to use in a microwave oven, according to Johnson-Arbor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both act as insulators, meaning that they are resistant to heat transfer," she says, so the vessels themselves don't get hot, while the electromagnetic waves work to heat the food contained within them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to tolerating high heat, "glass and ceramic containers usually do not contain organic chemical additives," says Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glass&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass containers are safe as long as rubber or plastic lids don't come in direct contact with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many glass storage containers have lids with a rubber or plastic element, these are generally fine as long as those elements don't come into contact with the food. (But be sure to clean thoroughly so that rubber seals don't develop mold.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for the best possible option, casserole dishes with glass tops and no seals are ideal vessels for microwave cooking and reheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="542633e1-3d71-46f5-a5ac-48c0a5e79964" data-cy="shortcodeListicle" data-id="listicle-542633e1-3d71-46f5-a5ac-48c0a5e79964" data-location="LIST" data-position="1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-border-thin-light-top g-inner-spacing-bottom-medium g-inner-spacing-left-large g-inner-spacing-right-large g-inner-spacing-bottom-xlarge c-shortcodeListicle-notInfoCard g-outer-spacing-bottom-large g-border-thin-light-bottom g-border-thin-light-right g-border-thin-light-left"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_text"&gt;     &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek c-shortcodeListicleDek c-shortcodeListicleDek-inline g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For safely nuking food, glass is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ceramic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceramic containers are some of the safest options for microwaving food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Qwart/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial ceramics are generally microwave-safe and should be labeled as such, but be sure to double-check those that are more decorative or artisan-made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The glazes found on some ceramic products can contain heavy metals, including lead," says Johnson-Arbor.

"But in recent years, scientists have discovered that tiny plastic particles, called microplastics, can leach out from food storage containers when heated." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/accidentally-eating-plastic-common-foods-more-likely-contain-microplastics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; entered the conversation, many brands have claimed to be "BPA-free" to ease consumers' minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Polycarbonate food containers are made from a group of chemicals called bisphenols," says Li. Bisphenol A is commonly referred to as BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BPA is known to interfere with hormones and has been linked to some endocrine-disrupting effects," he says. "Even though polycarbonate can physically handle high temperatures, meeting the 'microwave safe' requirement for manufacturers, microwave heating speeds up the release of BPA, especially when the container is scratched, reused many times, or holds fatty or acidic foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/home/microplastics-could-be-leaching-into-your-food-if-youre-making-this-simple-mistake/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microplastics Could Be Leaching Into Your Food if You're Making This Simple Mistake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA-free containers are marginally better, according to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Polypropylene, often called 'PP plastic' or labeled '#5 plastic,' is generally a better option," says Li. "It has good heat resistance and tends to contain fewer additives compared to other plastics. That said, fewer doesn't mean none, and it still uses some chemicals like antioxidants or stabilizers during manufacturing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest possible stance? "Since the overall impact of microplastics on our health is still unknown, some people choose to entirely avoid using plastic food containers in microwave ovens," says Johnson-Arbor, which is the safest possible stance, regardless of whether something is BPA-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic wrap, which is generally approved for use in the microwave due to its heat tolerance, &lt;a href="https://osteopathic.org/what-is-osteopathic-medicine/microwaves-and-plastics/#:~:text=Although%20certain%20types%20of%20plastic,paper%20or%20white%20paper%20towels." target="_self"&gt;should never come into direct contact with food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to give up the convenience and budget-friendly nature of BPA-free plastic storage containers (and you're committed to taking responsible care of them and tossing them if they get scratched), here's a set we have previously recommended.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paper comes with a catch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decorative and colored paper plates should stay out of the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Dorling Kindersley:Dave King/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have several types of paper on hand in your kitchen, including paper towels, wax paper, parchment paper, butcher paper and even a variety of paper plates for festive occasions. Should you put any of it in the microwave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most everyday uses, plain white paper towels or paper plates are generally safe to use in the microwave," says Li. A paper towel is a handy cover for reheating food on ceramic plates, helping to avoid splatter without resorting to plastic wrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's also a catch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should avoid microwaving colored or decorated paper plates, brown grocery or take-out bags, and any paper plates that have a water- or oil-resistant coating," he says. "This is because we cannot exclude the possibility that they can smoke, melt or release unwanted chemicals when heated." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same holds true for wax paper, which can melt or degrade at high temperatures or when in contact with certain types of food. If a paper product has a shiny or smooth side, best to avoid it as a general rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metals are never microwave safe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep all metal, including aluminum foil, out of the microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to microwave cooking, metals are unsafe not because of health or heat tolerance reasons. Stainless steel and cast iron are excellent materials for stovetop cooking, but they can't be placed in the microwave due to the way microwaves operate. Putting them in the microwave is both counterproductive and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metal reflects the electromagnetic waves," explains Johnson-Arbor, which prevents them from actually heating your food.

She said she'd made and drunk juice from store-bought calabash every day for years, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6010206218391403639&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs43678-022-00358-1%3Fsharing_token%3DM88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-womans-homemade-juice-led-to-life-threatening-toxic-squash-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s43678-022-00358-1?sharing_token=M88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%3D" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs43678-022-00358-1%3Fsharing_token%3DM88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-womans-homemade-juice-led-to-life-threatening-toxic-squash-syndrome" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, on this occasion, she noted that it tasted "abnormally bitter," rather than having its more typical mild squash flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5ccb0a16-d472-4f98-baf8-461aa46a14d6"&gt;Tests revealed that the woman's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and breathing rate were high, and her blood pressure was initially high and then fell concerningly low. Her extremities were also unusually cool to the touch, indicating she had poor circulation. Meanwhile, one of the chambers of her heart was pumping very forcefully, and an echocardiogram suggested she was having other heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team restored the woman's blood pressure to normal levels by giving her intravenous fluids, but she still subsequently had several episodes of "profound" low pressure. She also continued to experience diarrhea and vomited blood several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where doctors examined her gastrointestinal tract via gastroscopy, in which a thin tube with a camera in it is inserted into the mouth and guided into the throat and stomach. They found that her stomach lining was inflamed and bleeding as a result of tissue damage, which was likely caused by poor oxygen delivery to the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient was diagnosed with shock, a life-threatening condition in which blood flow starkly declines and ultimately injures organs. In this case, the shock stemmed from toxins in the squash juice. This "bitter bottle gourd poisoning" is a type of "toxic squash syndrome," which is caused by eating toxic substances sometimes found in squashes and gourds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cETSP26NcEF8UBhSmqRwK4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cETSP26NcEF8UBhSmqRwK4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calabash is specifically a "cucurbit," meaning it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family that includes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51000-cucumber-nutrition.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51000-cucumber-nutrition.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cucumbers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, pumpkins, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/46019-watermelon-nutrition.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/46019-watermelon-nutrition.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watermelon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and zucchini. Cucurbits produce &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/cucurbitacins.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/cucurbitacins.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bitter-tasting chemicals called cucurbitacins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can have toxic effects if consumed in large enough quantities. Domesticated varieties of these plants have been bred to contain minimal quantities of cucurbitacins so that they're both palatable and safe for humans to eat. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/#sec3" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/#sec3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;But in some cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cucurbits may accumulate these chemicals as they ripen, posing a rare risk to people who consume them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If ingested, cucurbitacin is toxic to humans by various purported albeit uncertain mechanisms," the report authors noted. The toxin is thought to disrupt signaling in cells and make blood vessels more permeable, and it ultimately injures mucous membranes in the body, especially in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is suspected that the gourd’s degree of bitterness correlates with its cucurbitacin concentration and thus toxicity; however, this is not definitively supported in the literature," the authors added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no specific antidote to bitter-gourd poisoning, so the medical team continued to monitor the patient's vital signs and stabilize them as needed. Her shock and associated symptoms went away after she'd spent five days in the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was then discharged, and on a follow-up call, she reported sudden and progressive hair loss that set in about two weeks after she'd been admitted to the hospital. The doctors noted that this is another likely symptom of "bitter bottle gourd poisoning and further supported this diagnosis." Hair loss has been reported in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/62158-toxic-squash-syndrome-hair-loss.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/62158-toxic-squash-syndrome-hair-loss.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other cases of the syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2204062e-a0bc-46a7-991e-e7c146997b16"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Toxic squash syndrome is considered very rare, and this was the first such case ever reported in Canada. Similar cases had previously been reported in other countries, such as India, where calabash juice is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;used in some forms of traditional medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="6d17fac5-d171-4c7e-b232-ebe076c2ac8a"&gt;

These stem cells have properties similar to embryonic stem cells and have the potential to become any cell in the human body, given the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Other scientists are using another type of stem cells that are already preprogrammed to become blood cells but haven't determined which kind yet. For example scientists at Laval University in Quebec, Canada recently &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/34/12/1001/8103850" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;extracted blood stem&lt;/a&gt; cells from donors with A positive blood. They then used Crispr-Cas9 technology to delete the genes coding for the A and Rh antigens, producing O Rh null immature red blood cells. Researchers in Barcelona, Spain, also recently &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1063" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;took stem cells&lt;/a&gt; from a Rh null blood donor, and used Crispr-Cas9 to convert their blood from type A to type O, making it more universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nevertheless, despite these impressive efforts it's important to say that creating artificial lab-grown blood on a scale where people could use it is still a long way off. One difficulty is to get the stem cells to grow into mature red blood cells. In the body, red blood cells are produced from stem cells in the bone marrow, which produces complex signals to guide how they develop. This is difficult to replicate in the laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is the added problem that when creating Rh null or any other null blood type, the growth and maturation of the red blood cells can be perturbed," says Denomme, who is now working as a medical affairs director at Grifols Diagnostic Solutions, a healthcare company which specialises in transfusion medicine. "Producing specific blood group genes might result in the cell membrane falling apart, or a loss of producing red blood cells efficiently in cell culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNQ1RmVnFYMjBYbi1XbkpNSTJjT3BYNGVVUS05allBZHhIUDN5UlkxSHV1U2xGUGIxUlNrYnlTWENqWWpWMm1VVE44Ylo3TW84NnVJaXA2a0VYOS1ZNnF2cVUwem1WcHdQVzItV0E3Z2lQeVhwc082dVMyMEtXZ3hEWVhCZm53YkJ6U3M5MFdR</guid></item><item><title>儿童有权接种疫苗。让我们引进律师- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/children-vaccines-measles-whooping-cough-rights-united-nations-conventions/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are doctors who trained continents apart: one of us in Sweden (Peterson) and one in India (Pai). As we worked during the 1980s and ’90s in those disparate countries, neither of us ever saw a case of measles, diphtheria, or whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was not a fluke. It was because the world once chose to fight these deadly childhood infections with miraculous tools called vaccines. These safe, effective, and remarkably affordable vaccines — costing as little as 60 cents per dose through UNICEF — pushed infections like polio, measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis) to the brink of elimination in many parts of the world, even in low- and middle-income nations. The measles vaccine alone has saved nearly &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/see-how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;94 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over the past 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025. We are horrified to see &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/return-measles-global-health-crisis-unfolding-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2169" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/health/diptheria-somalia-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.wk8.YKwB.U1okS4mnkZK2&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diphtheria&lt;/a&gt; staging a big comeback. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/10/measles-canada-americas-paho-who-elimination-status/"&gt;Canada lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which means the entire Americas region has also lost that status. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kids are dying of these infections even in some of the richest regions in the world, such as &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/mississippi-baby-dies-of-whooping-cough-the-states-first-pertussis-death-in-13-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mississippi,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/health/whooping-cough-pertussis-louisiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32374/2-Kentucky-infants-die-of-pertussis-as-cases-rise?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/premature-baby-dies-of-measles-in-alberta-outbreak-s-1st-death-1.7649692" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. This is an outrage, and a completely avoidable tragedy. We are failing children and not protecting their rights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that children in 2025 are suffering from diseases that should have been consigned to history is not just a public health failure. It is a moral failure. Access to vaccines is not a privilege — it is a human right. The World Health Organization’s constitution recognizes the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;right to health&lt;/a&gt;, and vaccine access is an essential part of health care. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Convention on the Rights of the Child&lt;/a&gt;, ratified by every country except the U.S., affirms every child’s right to the highest attainable standard of health. That includes protection from preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough, and diphtheria. Therefore, when a child dies from measles in a refugee camp in Yemen, or when a toddler in Florida is hospitalized with whooping cough because their community rejected vaccines, it is a breach of duty — by governments, by health systems, by all of us. Children have a right to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In global health, human rights have been critical for advancing access to health care. For example, when medicines became available for AIDS, access was a huge issue in low- and middle-income countries. Activists in countries like South Africa and Brazil resorted to &lt;a href="https://www.spotlightnsp.co.za/2012/11/09/ten-years-since-the-tac-case-a-judgment-that-saved-a-million-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt; to ensure universal, free access to antiretroviral drugs, demonstrating how human rights principles can be used to achieve public health goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advocates in Peru have used human rights as a basis for their advocacy for &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/reproductive-health/abortion/ibp-story-peru.pdf?sfvrsn=244213ff_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;abortion rights&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, the International Court of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.unepfi.org/themes/climate-change/cop-30-a-turning-point-for-climate-human-rights-and-the-finance-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the U.N. General Assembly’s 2022 resolution recognizing a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a foundational human right. This paves the way for climate justice advocacy, as well as legal challenges against climate change denialism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As vaccine denialism poses a huge threat to children, it is important to use similar rights-based approaches to ensure their protection. Children rely on adults for safety, but when adults and governments are intentionally spreading anti-vax misinformation, or actively reducing access to essential vaccines, who is to protect kids and safeguard their right to health? A human rights framing and the accompanying legal instruments allow us to hold political leaders accountable. Those who intentionally spread disinformation must also be held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crisis is worsening. In 2023, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; are happening in every region of the world, with large outbreaks in the United States and Canada due to dangerously low immunization rates. In these rich nations, disinformation and mistrust are the key challenges, not vaccine availability or resources. It is a matter of grave injustice today that some of the worst disinformation on vaccines is coming from the highest levels in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/17/health-infectious-diseases-vaccination-measles-us-robert-kennedy-latin-america-antivax-blamed-cases-deaths-rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;, rippling across the world and exacerbated by&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-stop-financial-support-global-vaccine-alliance-gavi-says-health-secretary-2025-06-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; funding&lt;/a&gt; cuts to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, as well as massive aid cuts by G7 nations. Both disinformation and funding cuts now threaten vaccinations globally. In countries like Yemen, children are dying from measles because war has shattered health systems, displaced families, and disrupted vaccine delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of whooping cough is &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2169" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt;, with China reporting 476,690 cases and 31 deaths in 2024, a roughly 12-fold increase compared with 2023. The United Kingdom went from about 856 cases in 2023 to nearly 15,000 in 2024, with 11 infant deaths. And outbreaks spread across Africa following drops in vaccination coverage. Large diphtheria &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/health/diptheria-somalia-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.wk8.YKwB.U1okS4mnkZK2&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; are currently ongoing in Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Chad — countries with conflicts or large populations of under-vaccinated refugees, or countries with fragile health systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We adults — parents, politicians, policymakers, professionals — owe children more than thoughts and prayers. We owe them action that is rooted in science. That means funding immunization programs in fragile states. It means countering misinformation with empathy and evidence. It means ensuring that no child is left unprotected because of where they live, what their parents believe, or how much money they have. It means continuing to invest in new vaccine research and continuing to fund global agencies that work to protect children, like WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also means using the courts to get justice for children. It’s a sign of the times — and a necessary shift in strategy — that we need both vaccine nurses and children’s rights lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let us not forget — diseases like measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough are a warning. If we cannot uphold even the most basic right of access to a 60 cent vaccine, how can we claim to be building a livable world for our children? And if we cannot protect the most vulnerable children in our society, how are we a civilized or advanced society? &lt;/p&gt;
