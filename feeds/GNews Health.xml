      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I work in rehab, bracing, and supports for orthopedic surgeons. A huge wake-up call for my own health was seeing normal, successful people in their 40s to 60s who couldn't do more than one push-up or get up from a seated position on the floor, with chronic back pain, neck pain, obesity, and falling. I assumed you magically lose that strength once you're old and retired, but no! It's so important to consistently do some version of moderate cardio and strength training from childhood until past retirement age. Do not skip your 20s to 50s!"&lt;/span&gt;

Plenty of people find themselves taking a power nap to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65026836/foods-that-give-you-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost energy and fight fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;boost energy and fight fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new study shows that napping earlier in the day, along with other factors, could be connected with a high rate of mortality in certain groups. Though the research has yet to be peer reviewed, the findings are interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/Supplement_1/A152/8135607?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;followed 86,565 participants across the United Kingdom from the UK Biobank. The ages of the volunteers ranged from 43 to 79 years, with 57% of the study participants identifying as female and 43% identifying as male. Researchers evaluated participants’ daytime napping behaviors to determine a link between daytime naps and the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What researchers found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed self-reported daytime napping behavior alongside data collected from participants via activity trackers over seven days. Their daytime sleep habits were logged, tracking nap duration, timing, and any variation from existing nap habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data was cross-referenced against other factors, including chronotype (the time of day you prefer to sleep or when you’re the most alert or have the most energy), BMI (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which is not always an accurate predictor of health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which is not always an accurate predictor of health&lt;/a&gt;), demographics, comorbidities, nighttime sleep habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found a strong connection between nap patterns and long-term health risks, including longevity and mortality. Specifically, longer naps, increased individual variability in the lengths of daytime naps, and napping around noon and the early afternoon hours were associated with greater risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the potential importance of considering napping behaviors in risk stratification of mortality in middle-to-older aged adults,” researchers concluded, noting the value of incorporating nap assessments into clinical and public health practices in promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do certain nap patterns increase the risk of death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida &lt;/a&gt;explained that research suggests that shorter daytime naps (under 30 mins) can be associated with some health benefits for older adults, longer naps (60-plus mins) have been linked to increased risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown in this study, “Greater likelihood of napping around noon appears to have a detrimental impact on mortality risk,” Curtis said. “Further, there is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emerging research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emerging research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the variability in napping behavior over time in older adults, such as switching from short to long naps or vice versa, is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why would napping be associated with death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why napping may be associated with greater risk of mortality, according to Curtis, who explains that longer daytime napping itself may be a sign of poor nighttime sleep and sleep disorders—such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a44211864/insomnia-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and obstructive &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a43933932/sleep-apnea-linked-to-increased-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;—which “are known to be associated with worse health trajectories and increased mortality risk if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis explains that the fragmented sleep associated with both of these sleep disorders may disrupt circadian factors and affect daytime alertness, thus leading older adults to nap more easily during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also a reciprocal relationship between napping and worse health outcomes and mortality,” she continues, adding that certain nap patterns in older adults have long been associated with the increased chronic low-grade &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in various other medical conditions linked to worse health outcomes and longevity, “such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64255416/ultra-processed-foods-obesity-brain-changes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, hypertension, and osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more than just the fact that napping may be an indicator of an increased risk for death, Curtis reiterates, but &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:changes in existing nap patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;changes in existing nap patterns&lt;/a&gt; as well. “These metrics, in combination with worse nighttime sleep (such as shorter total sleep time), may predict worse mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the connection between napping and death be broken?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11357-024-01351-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65175910%2Fnegative-health-effects-of-taking-a-nap%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;cites research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the mortality risk associated with longer daytime napping in older adults may be lowered by certain lifestyle factors such as physical activity. “That is, specifically meeting the recommended weekly dosage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) can weaken the association between napping and mortality risk,” she continues. “Such physical activities for older adults could include fast walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, or hiking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis adds that the relationship between napping and mortality may be more nuanced in older adults and depend on sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. “At least &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22951185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that in older men, those who slept less than six hours and napped more than 30 minutes during the day had a higher risk of mortality,” she explains, noting that the same pattern wasn’t found in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Curtis says that when compared to older women, older men have higher rates of frequent nighttime urination and obstructive sleep apnea, both of which are linked to greater daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The longer napping and increased mortality relationship findings in older adults are largely consistent. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been fully determined,” Curtis says. “The napping and mortality relationship is complex and may be influenced by adverse or protective lifestyle factors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, substance use), nighttime sleep patterns, and underlying sleep disorders, medical comorbidities, age, as well as sex and gender-related factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed in this area, this study offers hope in identifying some early predictors of increased mortality and new clinical approaches for promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 19:28:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBsNGEyOFRETk9uYU5XaFNKMTZ4T1NRdGY1ZDhSRVFldDJ2QUMtY1p4aFF3ZjZSZjBGbmVrZzVSYkdmN0JGemx6d0lVRENyWldDeHNmdm93OGhweDRCMndLYlY4UkJfUlBmaVNnR2h5RDZhTzVOMFNEbTN6TEIwUQ</guid></item><item><title>结肠镜检查与粪便检查：医生发现哪种更擅长检测癌症- Earth.com | Colonoscopy vs. stool tests: Doctors found out which is better at detecting cancer - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNaXp6YmoyNDZUb21PVXk1MDV0WDFiWGtNTlQwNUZvWE5scnFyeUtqQ2lva05QYTBsVlNsWE5YdS1DeU9uWmk0djlMSzhuY0lQX3RRNk5VcnFuUGEtNTlFa2U3eTJBa0hXU196SWhBaTJyNFBIazhIVnV0ZllRSzJwdVNvSzJ5SDI0VzdFQnAtVjh2MG5JRmw4a2poaVFXQllmMXpieXdWNEJiUEd6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular screening can stop colorectal cancer before it turns deadly. A Spanish trial that followed 57,000 adults for a decade now shows that a laboratory stool test performs as well as a full colonoscopy at detecting early disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding supports the view that a quick fecal immunochemical test (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000704.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FIT&lt;/a&gt;) done at home can stand shoulder‑to‑shoulder with the hospital scope when the goal is catching cancer early. The result has lit up social media feeds and could change how doctors explain screening choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study leaders Dr. Antoni Castells of &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/antoni-castells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clínic de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.enriquequintero.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Enrique Quintero&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/sanidad/scs/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of the Canary Islands coordinated the decade‑long &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00619-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colonprev project&lt;/a&gt;, the first randomized comparison of these two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both physicians are veteran gastroenterologists who have spent years urging wider participation in national screening programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team worked with 15 tertiary hospitals across eight Spanish regions, randomly inviting half the participants to a one‑time colonoscopy and the other half to biennial FIT kits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful follow‑up over ten years allowed the researchers to record every &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/y-chromosome-disappearance-study-finds-direct-link-to-much-greater-cancer-risk/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis and related death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-cancer-cases-are-rising"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, doctors expect roughly 107,320 new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/protein-cd74-discovery-may-change-the-treatment-of-colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancers&lt;/a&gt; and 46,950 rectal cancers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers place the disease third among all cancers for incidence and keep it high on the public‑health agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall incidence has fallen about one percent per year in adults over 50 thanks to better screening and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, rates in adults younger than fifty have climbed 2.4 percent annually, highlighting why simple tests that people actually use matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality also remains substantial, with an estimated 52,900 U.S. deaths forecast for 2025, even as older age groups benefit from earlier detection and improved treatment. Every saved life therefore counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colonprev investigators recorded 55 colorectal‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-virus-that-attacks-black-eyed-peas-also-kills-cancer-tumors/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the colonoscopy group and 60 in the FIT group, a difference of just 0.02 percentage points that met their strict non‑inferiority margin of 0.16. Clinically, that means both strategies protect patients equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the stool test achieved this outcome while requiring no bowel prep, sedation, or time off work. Non‑inferiority therefore arrived with far less disruption to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participation in screening was higher among individuals invited to faecal immunochemical test screening than colonoscopy screening,” wrote Dr. Castells. His comment captures why uptake metrics deserve as much attention as raw test accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colonoscopy-screening-is-less-popular"&gt;Colonoscopy screening is less popular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better participation amplifies the impact of any screening program, because an excellent test is useless if few people complete it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health planners often describe this benefit as the difference between efficacy (how well something works in theory) and effectiveness (how well it works in the real world).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier interim &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22356323/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2012, hinted at the same pattern: screening participation was better with FIT while colonoscopy found more benign adenomas without improving &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bats-dont-get-cancer-now-scientists-think-they-know-the-reason/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; mortality at that time. The full ten‑year data confirm that early signal and settle the mortality question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Spanish trial, 39.9 percent of those invited mailed back FIT kits compared with 31.8 percent who scheduled colonoscopies. Similar gaps appear in U.S. insurance &lt;a href="https://ascopost.com/news/october-2022/study-examines-efficacy-cost-of-fit-vs-multitarget-stool-dna-testing-for-colorectal-cancer-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare figures place the average price of an at‑home FIT around $24, whereas a colonoscopy with facility fees often reaches $635 or more. That sticker difference alone can sway both patients and payers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond dollars, convenience matters; the scope requires a clear liquid diet, a potent laxative, transportation, and recovery time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stool card, by contrast, takes minutes in the privacy of one’s bathroom and slips into a prepaid envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, colonoscopy offers an immediate therapeutic edge because doctors can remove suspicious polyps during the same session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive FIT therefore triggers a follow‑up colonoscopy to finish the job, making both tests partners rather than rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4949-colonoscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes that minor side effects like temporary bloating are common, while serious complications such as bleeding or a tear in the bowel wall are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing these risks helps people weigh the comfort of FIT against the one‑and‑done nature of colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-you"&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; advises starting regular screening at age forty‑five and continuing through seventy‑five, with the choice of yearly FIT, colonoscopy every ten years, or several other approved options. Older adults up to eighty‑five may also benefit, depending on overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking a test that fits your lifestyle greatly increases the odds you will stick with the schedule. Many clinics now mail FIT kits directly after a routine visit, and some pharmacies hand them out without an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your clinician how family history, inflammatory bowel disease, or certain genetic syndromes might alter timing or frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a plan is in place, set a reminder, complete the test on time, and encourage friends and relatives to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (&lt;a href="https://fascrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ASCRS&lt;/a&gt;) lists fiber‑rich foods, regular exercise, limited red meat, and quitting tobacco among six clear steps that cut risk. Screening finds problems early, and healthy choices lower the odds those problems ever appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, do not ignore new digestive symptoms between screenings, because even the best schedule cannot replace prompt care when something feels off. Warning signs like rectal bleeding or unexplained weight loss deserve swift attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158525/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 18:54:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNaXp6YmoyNDZUb21PVXk1MDV0WDFiWGtNTlQwNUZvWE5scnFyeUtqQ2lva05QYTBsVlNsWE5YdS1DeU9uWmk0djlMSzhuY0lQX3RRNk5VcnFuUGEtNTlFa2U3eTJBa0hXU196SWhBaTJyNFBIazhIVnV0ZllRSzJwdVNvSzJ5SDI0VzdFQnAtVjh2MG5JRmw4a2poaVFXQllmMXpieXdWNEJiUEd6</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您不应该服用预防癌症的5种补充剂- EatingWell | 5 Supplements You Shouldn’t Take to Prevent Cancer, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE15NE9iWHRmbVdZZTIwdjYwa1h3QlZqVHMzXzRaZldFaTZRa1JJa3FQVmhpYXptUEFPbkdmc21uajUzV0I1MUFJd2JzZ0g4MVNxN3FBZ1JlM01TQWlyeFJZYlBsTTF4OWs0dE1WSXp2N2lVZFp4bjBPd1h6bF9yYTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary supplements shouldn’t be taken to reduce your cancer risk—some may actually increase your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts encourage getting nutrients from food like fruit, veggies and whole grains instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider lifestyle changes like limiting alcohol and getting regular exercise to lower your cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one thing you can take away after reading this article, it’s this: Supplements do not prevent cancer. That’s the stance of the World Cancer Research Fund, which encourages people to get their nutrients from food, not supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Overwhelmingly, studies on supplements rarely pan out,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/patient-family/support-services/nutrition/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hillary Wright, M.Ed., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior oncology dietitian at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In specific situations, supplements may be useful for filling personal gaps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-an-oncologist-has-for-breakfast-11722729" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in one’s diet&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re not useful when it comes to preventing cancer in the future, says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the pull to pop is understandable. “It can be easier to take a pill than think about how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet,” says Wright. Let’s address five supplements that have been suggested to help prevent cancer and what you should do instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-beta-carotene"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Beta Carotene &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beta carotene is an antioxidant plant pigment that’s part of the carotenoid family.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Antioxidants are substances that neutralize cell-damaging free radicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Your body converts &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-a-than-carrot-11690733" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beta carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be found in produce like carrots, dark leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes and cantaloupe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The interest in beta carotene came from the observation that people who eat more fruits and vegetables seem to get less lung cancer. However, beta carotene is one singular component of countless compounds that someone’s body is exposed to if they eat more fruits and vegetables,” Wright explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When research was done on beta carotene supplements, scientists learned that people who smoke and take beta carotene get more lung cancer, and the research had to be terminated, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wright adds, “From a nutritionist standpoint, it’s not surprising that when we cherry-pick a particular nutrient and take it in high doses that don’t occur in nature, there may be unintended consequences.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is another antioxidant vitamin that has had a long history of being linked to immune system support. “There’s been an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; ‘boosting’ the immune system for decades. I haven’t read any science that backs that up across the board,” says Wright. “There is a lack of evidence suggesting that we should take daily supplemental vitamin C.” (It’s a water-soluble vitamin, so you typically urinate the excess, and there’s less of a safety risk compared to other supplements like beta carotene.&lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/research-policy/evidence-for-our-recommendations/supplements/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) That said, eating foods high in vitamin C is a good idea—and in fact, a C-rich diet has been associated with a lower incidence of several cancers, including breast, cervical, endometrial, esophageal, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like beta carotene, taking vitamin E may cause more problems than it solves. It’s an antioxidant, which is why vitamin E supplements have been linked to cancer prevention. Although there have been studies done on the effects of vitamin E supplements on some cancers, the results have been mixed. Disappointingly, there is not enough evidence that taking vitamin E will help you prevent cancer, and it can increase your risk of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer, when consumed in large doses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is considered a hormone that improves calcium absorption in the gut and affects bone formation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We get&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from the food we eat (such as dairy), and our skin produces the vitamin in response to sun exposure. There is no doubt that adequate vitamin D is incredibly important for overall health. “We have vitamin D receptors in almost every cell in our body—but this doesn’t mean that people need to be super vitamin D’d,” says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cancer, while there is evidence that D may inhibit the growth of cancer cells in animal models, there is no data to suggest that this decreases the risk of cancer in humans.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430526/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you suspect your levels of D are inadequate (a frequent occurrence in the winter months for those in more northern climates), talk to your health care provider about being tested for vitamin D and if a supplement is right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium is a key nutrient for bone health, muscle and nerve function, and blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In some instances, your health care provider may recommend supplemental doses if you are at risk for calcium deficiency due to your health or diet. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess intake of calcium&lt;/a&gt;—more than 1,000 milligrams from supplements daily—is associated with a 53% increased risk of cancer mortality, research has found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Calcium from food was found to be safe.) It’s not yet clear why excess supplemental calcium may have this detrimental impact, but the amount of calcium absorbed by the body may differ when it comes from food versus supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-cancer-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cancer prevention isn’t found in a pill. “Overwhelmingly, diet and lifestyle strategies show the most promise for reducing cancer risk and supporting survivorship,” says Wright. According to the WCRF, 40% of cancer cases are preventable.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The following is an evidence-backed list of five of the WCRF’s recommendations to prevent cancer:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: &lt;/strong&gt;Overweight and obesity can lead to chronic inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones, which may lead to cancer. The more weight a person carries and the longer they do, the greater the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be physically active: &lt;/strong&gt;Getting regular exercise can help manage your weight. Adults should aim for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables (including beans) and fruits contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and other plant compounds that may help prevent cancer. These foods, in addition to whole grains, may also reduce the risk of cancer by supporting a healthy weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit fast foods, red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;The science is clear on the connection between increased cancer risk (especially colorectal cancer) and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt;. Red and processed meat may also play a role in increasing the risk of breast cancer and some forms of prostate cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and don’t smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking can increase your risk for certain types of cancer, like throat, colon, rectum, breast and liver. Stay within the guidelines for alcohol (two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women). Smoking is responsible for 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths, but it also raises your risk for many cancers, including bladder, blood, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also on this WCRF list? “Do not use supplements for cancer prevention.” You heard it from the experts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary supplements should not be taken to reduce your cancer risk. While many are probably completely ineffective (creating only expensive urine), some supplements have been shown to paradoxically &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; your risk of cancer. That includes high intakes of antioxidant supplements, most notably beta carotene. Consuming nutrients through a healthy, balanced diet is safe and healthy. Plus, a diet that focuses on plant-based foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes has been shown to be protective against cancers. If you need to take a supplement due to a health condition or dietary need, follow your health care provider’s recommendations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE15NE9iWHRmbVdZZTIwdjYwa1h3QlZqVHMzXzRaZldFaTZRa1JJa3FQVmhpYXptUEFPbkdmc21uajUzV0I1MUFJd2JzZ0g4MVNxN3FBZ1JlM01TQWlyeFJZYlBsTTF4OWs0dE1WSXp2N2lVZFp4bjBPd1h6bF9yYTA</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究表明， BMI是B-A-D。这里有一个更好的体重测量方法- KSL新闻 | BMI is B-A-D, a new study suggests.

Health professionals have long used body mass index as a quick screening tool to fast-track certain patients into a "code red" management plan — people whose weight puts them in danger of future health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is that BMI measures health risk by calculating height and weight. However, muscle and bone weigh more than fat, so BMI measurements can overestimate the danger for people with a muscular build or a larger frame. Conversely, BMI can underestimate health concerns in older adults and anyone who has lost muscle, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, authors of a new study say a different approach to weight measurement may be a more accurate way to predict future health issues. Bioelectrical impedance analysis, or BIA, uses undetectable electric currents to measure not only the percentage of body fat but also lean muscle mass and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works like this: You stand on metal plates on the machine while holding your hands or thumbs on another metal attachment held away from the body. Once started, the machine sends a weak electrical current through the body. Body fat, muscle and bone all have different electrical conductivity, so the machine uses algorithms to determine lean muscle mass, body fat percentage and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found body-fat percentage to be a stronger predictor of 15-year mortality risk in adults between the ages of 20 and 49 than BMI," said Arch Mainous III, lead author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Family Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to deaths from heart disease, people with high body fat as measured by BIA were 262% times more likely to die than people who had a healthy percentage of body fat, said Mainous, a professor and vice chair of research in community health and family medicine at the University of Florida School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now remember, using BMI did not flag any risk at all in this younger population, which isn't one we typically consider to be at high risk for heart disease," said senior author Dr. Frank Orlando, a clinical associate professor of community health and family medicine at University of Florida Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of the interventions we can do to keep them healthy when we know this early. I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with BMI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI is measured by dividing your weight by the square of your height. (If you are mathematically challenged like I am, the National Institutes of Health has a free calculator.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BMI world, a body mass between 18.5 and 24.9 is a healthy weight, between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, between 30 and 34.9 is obese, between 35 and 39.9 is class 2 obesity, and anything greater than 40 is "severe" or class 3 obesity. People are considered underweight if their BMI is lower than 18.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using BMI to measure health risk works — on a population level. Countless studies have shown that a greater BMI really does correlate with developing chronic diseases of all kinds — cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney and liver disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where BMI fails is at the patient level. Imagine a patient who is "skinny fat" — thin on the outside but riddled with globs of fat wrapped around major organs on the inside. Your BMI would be fine even though your health was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those people are more likely to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, more likely to have elevated glucose, more likely to have elevated blood pressure, and more likely to have inflammation in general," Mainous said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these health issues can be treated, stopped and in some cases even reversed if caught early enough, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Frank Orlando, clinical associate professor at University of Florida Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors are aware of the issues with BMI, many prefer it "because it is cheap and easily put into practice," Mainous said. "They'd like to use a more direct measurement such as a DEXA scan, but those cost too much and are not widely available, so everyone falls back to the indirect measure of BMI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEXA stands for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and is the gold standard for body mass analysis. Such machines can cost between $45,000 and $80,000, so patients typically travel to a hospital or specialty center to get the scan, Orlando said. The cost to the patient can easily be $400 to $500 per scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we found the newer versions of bioelectrical impedance are pretty accurate, giving some valid and reliable results," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One note — at-home based bioelectrical impedance products are not nearly as accurate, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can be affected a lot by how much body fluid you have, how hydrated you are," said Freeman, who was not involved with the new research. "At-home measurements will only give a ballpark — the clinic-based machines are more precise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it time for doctors to embrace body fat measurements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed data on 4,252 men and women who participated in the 1999 to 2004 federal survey called NHANES, or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a yearly checkup of the nation's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technicians measured each person's body composition, including height, weight and waist circumference. In addition, all participants underwent a clinic-based bioelectrical impedance analysis, which measures the body's resistance to electrical currents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the National Death Index through 2019 to see how many people died. After adjusting for age, race and poverty status, the study found a BMI that labeled someone as obese was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of death from any cause, when compared with those in healthy BMI range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high body fat as measured by bioimpedance analysis, however, were 78% more likely to die from any cause, Mainous said. Measuring waist circumference was also helpful, but not as accurate as body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add that to the 262% higher chance of dying from heart disease found by the study, and it's a no-brainer for doctors to use bioelectrical impedance analysis on patients, Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hugs001i3b76xyr0opqa@published"&gt;I’m a guy. When I masturbate, and I start to orgasm, suddenly my brain kicks into high gear. I start to think about the quality of the orgasm, reconstructing what I did to make it great or not great, and wondering why I’m thinking about these things. Then I start to think about a problem at work I need to solve, what I’m doing for the weekend, and so on, even while I’m still feeling it. Why does this happen? Does some chemical get released in my brain that supercharges my logical side?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hupq001l3b76ja8kn2sn@published"&gt;Straight up, I cannot tell you for sure what this is. It isn’t widely reported enough to be able to say for certain (and if it were, you probably wouldn’t even have to ask). I will offer a potential explanation below that could lead to action on your part in terms of curbing this, though you should determine for yourself whether or not this is something you want to change. From your description, it doesn’t seem to disturb you too much, so the rest of this question may amount to much ado about nothing. Sometimes our thoughts race, no big deal! But if you’re interested in potentially not going through the post-orgasm, high-gear brain, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7husj001m3b76orwn1bz9@published"&gt;One group that does report a similar-sounding phenomenon is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qu1m05/does_anyone_else_experience_intrusive_thoughts/"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;. Do you think it’s fair to call these thoughts “intrusive?” They certainly seem unwelcome and some (particularly those regarding the orgasm you’re having) may qualify as obsessive. Perhaps you have noticed other times in your life when similar thinking manifests, but even if not, it could be somehow related to OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7huxh001n3b762zynrifq@published"&gt;OCD is “one of the most misdiagnosed disorders,” according to psychologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.monnicawilliams.com/about.php"&gt;Monnica Williams&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Obsessions-Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder-Step/dp/0190624795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Step-by-Step, Definitive Guide to Understanding, Diagnosis, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “People with OCD can get stuck on anything,” Williams told me when I reached her by phone to discuss your question. “It’s not just germs, not just lining up things on your desk.” The diffuse array of OCD’s presentations can be challenging to clinicians. “We know from research that we’ve done surveying psychologists and counselors that unless it shows up in these very stereotypical ways, it’s often missed,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv0v001o3b76h46sc7ec@published"&gt;Williams said that what you describe &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be OCD, but again, this is not a diagnosis—it’s a suggestion for future inquiry on your part, should you be interested in taking it up. Williams said that people with OCD generally “tend to focus on things that are most important to them or central to their identity.” If sex is particularly important to a person, “it could certainly happen that the OCD would tend to strike in that area,” said Williams. Certain events can be more triggering than others, so if you’re only experiencing the intrusive thoughts during orgasm, it could still be a sign of OCD. And, if what’s happening is OCD-related, your brain during these moments could indeed qualify as “supercharged,” “in that you can look at a person’s brain with a PET scan and you can see the increased activity in some of the circuits that are responsible for OCD,” explained Williams. “The brain is in overdrive when a person has OCD. But, I don’t know if I would necessarily correlate that with logic per se,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv5q001p3b76nh63csy6@published"&gt;Identifying whether this is OCD or not is important because if it is, there are clinical methods to treat it—namely exposure and ritual prevention, according to Williams. In the event that Williams had a patient who reported what you did, she would suggest the following treatment: “What I might do is say, ‘OK, when you masturbate afterwards, instead of thinking about the quality of the orgasm, you’re gonna say to yourself: That orgasm was shit—oh, well. And move on. And in that way, you’re doing kind of the opposite of what your pattern had been. And that’s how you break the cycle.” Mindfulness can help facilitate this, as it can help you gain awareness of your thoughts and your ability to change course. Even if you don’t pursue OCD treatment, I suggest you start practicing mindfulness (see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/wife-secret-sex-toy-advice-tracking.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for some general background). It may make intervening more easy when your mind starts racing.&lt;/p&gt;

Williams is the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.ocdtypes.com/"&gt;New England OCD Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which may be worth checking out as well—the website offers a self-test that you may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hveg001s3b763coo1r65@published"&gt;My boyfriend (we’re both men) recently suggested something that has me both excited and apprehensive. He said he wanted to try fisting me. I’m a bottom, but this doesn’t sound like a good idea. I know women get fisted, but let’s face it—vaginas can handle babies. The backdoor wasn’t built for that. Is what my boyfriend wants to do safe or possible for a gay couple?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvpp001v3b76pjrv9azf@published"&gt;Yes, Virginia, there are men who get fisted. For some, this is a special occasional treat and for others, it’s a Tuesday night. The gay community contains multitudes and a dude with a hand up his ass is never too far away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvsr001w3b76mrfay2wb@published"&gt;Is fisting safe? It can be if done properly, but it comes with risks in both the long and short term. For a &lt;a href="http://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/boyfriend-pushing-it-advice.html"&gt;previous column&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist Carlton Thomas (known on social media as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/doctorcarlton/?hl=en"&gt;@DoctorCarlton&lt;/a&gt;) told me that most of the long-term consequences of fisting are a result of injuries—getting permanently stretched out is a lesser concern, because of what Thomas refers to as the anus’s “incredible snapback,” though it is possible. Said injuries can include bleeding, tearing, and hemorrhoids, &lt;a href="https://bespokesurgical.com/2024/11/14/anal-fisting-guide/"&gt;according to anal surgeon Evan Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;. Stephen Goldstone’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ins-Outs-Gay-Sex-Handbook/dp/0440508460"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex: A Medical Handbook for Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big toys or fisting can be dangerous. Any stiff, long object may not negotiate the natural bend in your colon and tear through the wall—an extremely dangerous situation that requires emergency surgery to repair. Thick toys (especially fists) can damage your sphincter muscle and may eventually lead to an inability to control your bowels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw0e001y3b76nxcb65hx@published"&gt;And as with other anal play, pain is a distinct possibility, as is the transmission of STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="202" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw2l001z3b76ye3eezh5@published"&gt;There are guys who absolutely love fisting and find connectedness through the act, in spite (and in some cases because) of the risks. More potential danger yields more vulnerability. That said, this is not really beginner play and the intensity alone makes it something that you should only try if you really want it. “This doesn’t sound like a good idea,” isn’t convincing me that you’re a good candidate to get fisted. One of Thomas’s tips is to get fisted by an experienced fister, who can serve as a guide and hopefully troubleshoot in the moment. I’m not sure if your boyfriend qualifies but if you really want to dabble, I suggest bringing in a fisting top who can show both of you the ropes. He should be communicative, use lots of lube, and offer a covering for his fist (like a &lt;a href="https://www.mysextoyguide.com/best-fisting-gloves/"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt;) which can help smooth the texture. You almost certainly won’t be able to take a whole fist the first time you try (progressive dilation is key), so someone with the knowledge of this and attendant patience would also be essential. You can vet him ahead of time to see just how much of this he already knows and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyof003c3b76rqkpwjvg@published"&gt;A month ago my husband and I spent a week at my sister’s home out of state. The trouble is we left a cock ring behind. I went through our suitcases more than a dozen times without finding it. We brought it with us, so I’m certain it must have been lost there. She hasn’t contacted us to let us know she found it or mentioned it in the time we’ve spoken since the visit. It has sentimental value, but I’m embarrassed as hell to ask if she came across it. My husband says to grow up: We’re all adults, my sister knows what sex is, and to just ask her already. Is he right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003f3b76mrw33hee@published"&gt;Firstly, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the idea of attaching sentimental value to a cock ring. It’s like a grown-up &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Call it &lt;em&gt;Sex Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine what all the sex toys get up to when you aren’t looking! Imagine how their existential grief intermingles with stigma-fueled shame when their owner wants to throw them away! After all, there’s no Goodwill section for sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003g3b76v80embp6@published"&gt;Anyway, did any of the &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; movies ever introduce the idea that people should be less sentimental about things? I can’t remember but I feel like no—those movies, in my recollection, have consistently perpetuated the deep ties that we have to inanimate objects. With all due respect to those who find themselves sexually attracted to or even in love with said objects, if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get over this, it’s probably easier just to get a new cock ring. They are plentiful. That way you could avoid having the conversation with your sister entirely, since the prospect of it vexes you so.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003h3b76h5vm7ljt@published"&gt;Otherwise, I side with your husband. Just ask. You don’t have to refer to it as a cock ring. Be vague and call it jewelry or a ring. Lie and say it’s a bandanna ring or a napkin ring. Tell her it’s a bangle for your doll’s arm. Obfuscate entirely: “We left something behind.” Or straight-up tell her it’s a cock ring. Decide what terminology is least uncomfortable for you and go with it. You’re both adults. This may be awkward and it may represent a new discursive frontier if you and your sister don’t typically discuss sex, but she shouldn’t hold your sexuality against you.&lt;/p&gt;

I've had an ECG but this didn't reveal anything abnormal. Do I need treatment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Palpitations involve the heart racing or beating abnormally. Some people may notice a thumping or feel an irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes this is accompanied by breathlessness or the need to cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Palpitations can be triggered by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-7b6490e0-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, strenuous exercise, a lack of sleep, stress, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-7b62bc20-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, nicotine and certain medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While uncomfortable, palpitations caused by one of these factors are not dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, heart palpitations can also be a sign of a potentially worrying heart rhythm condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, atrial fibrillation triggers an unsteady heartbeat and is caused by a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation also often leads to chest pain, difficulty exercising and shortness of breath. There are medicines that can control the rate and rhythm of the heart, such as beta blockers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation patients may also need surgery to manage the problem. In order to spot the cause of palpitations, patients are often told to wear a device called an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures heart rhythm, for as long as five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because, for some patients, palpitations may occur only occasionally, making them difficult to pick up on a quick test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who continue to have palpitations with no clear cause should ask their GP for further tests in order to find the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is important to remember that all conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;I'm 64 and recently found out my new partner is &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-9ec09720-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" class=""&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; positive. I want to get tested but my GP is also my neighbour, and I'm embarrassed to talk to her about my sex life. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; If personal relationships with a GP make it difficult to seek medical advice, registering with a different practice may be the most appropriate option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some people understandably feel uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics with someone they know socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In such cases, switching GP practices is straightforward and can be done via the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-9ec61560-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; website:&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp"&gt; nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV – human papillomavirus – is a very common viral infection, typically passed on through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around eight in ten people will contract it at some point and, in most cases, it is harmless. However, in rare instances it can lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the primary cause of cervical cancer, which is why NHS cervical screening &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7912671/Cervical-cancer-rates-steep-rise-women-late-20s-charity-warns.html" class=""&gt;includes HPV testing for women aged 25 to 64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over this age are not routinely screened, as evidence suggests that a new HPV infection at this age is unlikely to progress to cervical cancer. This is because cancerous changes in the cervix usually take decades to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those over 65 who missed their final cervical screening, an HPV test can still be requested. The most reliable way to access this is through a sexual health clinic, as not all GP surgeries offer the test, whereas all NHS sexual health services do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-8e21c9d0-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Can't focus? You may lack iron&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm concerned that many people do not know the signs of an iron deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A friend of mine recently went to donate blood and was turned away because a quick test revealed she was anaemic – meaning she has low levels of the crucial nutrient iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had no idea, and many of my patients are surprised to find out they have anaemia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body needs iron to transport oxygen to the organs. Without enough of it, it can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches and heart palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some sufferers also struggle to concentrate. The problem is more common among women. It's also linked to poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is easily treated, by changing diet or taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you found out that you have anaemia? Did it affect your focus? Please use the email address on the right to let me know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;My knees are weak. They aren't sore or inflamed, but when I crouch down I can't get up unless I push off the floor with my hands. What could be the reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Weakness in the legs is unlikely to be caused by an issue with the knees. Instead, there's a greater chance that it's due to problems in the surrounding muscles. Knee problems, like arthritis, tend to trigger pain in the joint or visible swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later life, many people develop a condition called sarcopenia. This is where the muscles slowly reduce in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to combat sarcopenia is to undertake strength-training exercises. These include lifting weights, using exercise bands and doing squats and lunges. These exercises are proven to build and maintain strong muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is different to cardiovascular exercise, such as running or swimming, which is also good for the body but won't necessarily fend off sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees are primarily supported by the quadricep muscles, also known as the quads, which make up the front of the thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone struggling with strength in this area of the body might benefit from a few sessions with a physiotherapist or personal trainer who can teach you some exercises that might help. Any sudden and severe muscle weakness should be investigated by a GP as it can be a sign of disease, such as an autoimmune condition like thyroid disease or lupus. A GP can run blood tests to rule out these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle weakness can also sometimes be a side effect of certain medications such as statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-6c571f80-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;It'll be a long wait for NHS weight-loss jabs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week as it was announced that GPs could start &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13492567/UK-health-chiefs-weight-loss-U-turn-NHS-watchdog-gives-green-light-King-Kong-slimming-jab-Mounjaro-year-refusing-approve-it.html"&gt;prescribing the weight-loss drug Mounjaro on the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, I was not impressed by the way it was handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting claimed it could 'end the obesity epidemic' and the jabs would be available to 'everyone who needs them'. This does not reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can be prescribed weight-loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can get them on the NHS. The day after the announcement my practice was swamped with patients asking for a Mounjaro prescription. None of them qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the restrictions will be eased over time, most people who want these jabs will have to wait a very long time before they can get them on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you tried to get an NHS Mounjaro prescription? Were you successful? Please write in and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:54:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOSFphcnR1XzZOZjgteUVZWEswcVpVNmpSN2RyT2RfMWdVMlpheE9Rdkpnem9zM200d1MwMm1GM0F6aDdVSUtHMmwwbkRHTjRzYmNQZGVuaE0zMHRGTmtkNFJ0amVrRm5NdG9RWllveUJsUXNOUlY2LWJoX3RDbEdhejhja2JKZEtlanNxM3d1dlI0NHlaVWdsY1JMUnY4NGd4OTFocDRURFdRRDA</guid></item><item><title>他们的实验室被导弹摧毁，魏茨曼科学家发表了创新的血液癌症研究-以色列时报 | Their labs destroyed by a missile, Weizmann scientists publish innovative blood cancer study - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>外科医生分享了您的身体可能会警告您肠道健康状况不佳的6个早期迹象： “您总是感到疲倦或腹胀吗？ ’|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | Surgeon shares 6 early signs your body may be warning you about poor gut health: ‘Are you always tired or bloated?’ | Health - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101751202747946 " data-vars-storyid="101751202747946" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Akanksha Agnihotri" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Surgeon shares 6 early signs your body may be warning you about poor gut health: ‘Are you always tired or bloated?’&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt; Jun 29, 2025 07:55 PM IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;Bloating, fatigue, and cravings may seem normal, but they could signal gut trouble.

Constant bloating or gas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stomach feels like a balloon after meals, it’s not “normal.” It’s a red flag that your gut is struggling to break down food efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Skin breakouts (even in your 30s)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acne, rashes, or eczema can often be traced back to internal inflammation caused by poor &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/antibiotics-killing-your-gut-bacteria-doctor-shares-best-foods-to-eat-for-healing-and-balance-101739512909450.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut bacteria"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Brain fog or poor focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 90% of your serotonin (the feel-good hormone) is produced in your gut. If your mind feels cloudy or unfocused, your gut might be the missing link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Irregular bowel movements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhoea, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/constipation" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="constipation"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, or unpredictable toilet routines? Your gut is literally telling you something is off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Sugar cravings or energy slumps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craving sugar all the time or crashing by 3pm? An imbalanced gut can mess with your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-sugar" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and hunger signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Always tired, no matter how much you sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A damaged gut affects nutrient absorption. So even if you eat well, your body might not be getting what it needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is: gut issues don’t always scream. Sometimes, they whisper through mood swings, dull skin, or a sluggish brain,” says Dr. Sumit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

When the brain strays from this delicate balance, cognitive performance weakens, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s may begin to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed that tau protein buildup in Alzheimer’s disrupts criticality, while sleep appears to restore it, offering potential new therapeutic pathways. With tools like fMRI, this theory may lead to earlier diagnoses and personalized interventions to maintain or restore brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Defined:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain operates best at a near-chaotic tipping point known as criticality, essential for learning and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s may degrade cognition by disrupting the brain’s ability to maintain criticality, not just killing neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep restores the brain’s criticality, suggesting new ways to prevent or slow neurodegeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new paper with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders, Keith Hengen, an associate professor of biology in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, suggests a new comprehensive approach to understanding how the brain works and the rules it must follow to reach optimal performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a common perception that the human brain is the most complicated thing in the universe,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is immensely powerful, but that power may arise from a relatively simple set of mathematical principles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen starts with the premise that almost everything our brains do is learned or powerfully shaped by experience. In other words, we aren’t born with hard-wired circuits preprogrammed to help us read, drive cars or do anything else that we do every day. A healthy brain must be ready to learn anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how is a collection of neurons capable of learning? Hengen suggests that brains become learning machines only when they reach a special state called “criticality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concept borrowed from physics, criticality describes a complex system that is at the tipping point between order and chaos. At this razor’s edge, brains are primed to gain new information, Hengen said. “Brains need to reach criticality to think, remember and learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen proposed criticality as a unifying theory of brain function and disease in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodrow Shew, a physicist at the University of Arkansas, is the co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biologist and a physicist may seem like an odd pairing, but the new unifying theory blends both realms of science. Physicists often describe criticality using the classic example of a sand pile: As sand is added, the pile will grow steeper and steeper until it eventually avalanches. Right before that final grain triggered a moment of chaos, the pile was at a critical angle, one step away from instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shew explained that physicists first developed a deep understanding of criticality as a way to describe magnets and other materials. Around the turn of the 21st century, these ideas were expanded to explain a broader range of complex systems, including avalanches, earthquakes and, ultimately, living systems and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defining aspect of critical systems is that they look the same at any scale: A sand pile on the brink of an avalanche has the same slope whether the pile is tiny or mountainous. In the brain, criticality is constant whether it’s measured in a handful of neurons or an entire region. Likewise, brain patterns that unfold in time are startlingly similar when considered in milliseconds or hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This matches our intuitive understanding of how brains work,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our internal experiences span milliseconds to months. They don’t have a scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen and Shew suggest that criticality isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a state that can be precisely measured and calculated through fMRI brain imaging technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Criticality is the optimal computational state of the brain,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve developed a mathematical way to measure how close the brain is to criticality, which should help us nail down the fundamental questions about how a human brain works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A new understanding of disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticality framework offers a new perspective for understanding neurological disease. Rather than focusing on specific damaged brain regions or accumulated proteins, Hengen argues that diseases such as Alzheimer’s destroy something more basic: the brain’s ability to maintain criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases don’t just damage neurons, they break the brain’s general ability to compute by slowly dissolving criticality,” Hengen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a brain moves further and further from criticality, it loses the ability to adapt and process information effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framework explains a puzzling feature of brain diseases: Patients often appear completely normal until they’ve lost many neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain has remarkable compensatory abilities that can mask functional problems even as criticality begins to erode,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditional assessments miss the early stages because they focus on established endpoints that the brain tries to maintain through workarounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As criticality gradually deteriorates, the brain works harder to achieve the same cognitive outcomes, Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like an engine that still runs but requires more fuel and generates more heat. By the time we notice memory problems or other symptoms, criticality has likely been compromised for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen’s collaboration with David M. Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor at WashU Medicine, has revealed that tau protein buildup in Alzheimer’s directly disrupts criticality, providing a clear link between the disease’s molecular hallmarks and cognitive collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between criticality and Alzheimer’s opens exciting diagnostic possibilities. In theory, a simple fMRI could help detect breakdowns in criticality years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In combination with cutting-edge blood tests, we could identify people at risk and intervene before irreversible damage occurs,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another collaboration, Hengen has teamed up with Deanna Barch, the Gregory B. Couch Professor of Psychiatry at WashU Medicine and a professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences, for an observational study to see how criticality at birth determines cognitive development and abilities in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the beginning, some kids are closer to criticality than others, which, based on our theory, suggests they are going to be better learners,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many outside factors can affect their success in school, but criticality can explain an impressive amount of the variability between children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The sleep-mind connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, Hengen and co-author Ralf Wessel, a professor of physics in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at WashU, used the concept of criticality to revisit an age-old question: Why do we need sleep? By tracking brain activity over multiple weeks, they found that sleep restores a state of criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being awake and active moves us away from criticality, and sleep is like a reset button,” Hengen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could help researchers unlock the power of sleep as a therapy for Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases that push the brain away from its optimal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies by Holtzman and others have found that people who don’t get the sleep they need — perhaps due to shift work or chronic insomnia — are at a much higher risk for Alzheimer’s as they age. And there’s already some evidence that sleep interventions can help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen believes that targeted, intensive sleep-based therapy could help restore criticality and improve learning and memory in people with brain disease. Studies of mice conducted by Holtzman and James McGregor, a postdoctoral researcher in Hengen’s lab, offer a glimpse of the possibilities: Mice specifically bred to have symptoms of Alzheimer’s become faster learners after a targeted sleep intervention reinforces criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Critical future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much work to be done, but Hengen would eventually like to understand how criticality helps explain complex features of human neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may find that someone who is an amazing artist, for example, might be extremely close to criticality in parts of the brain involved in creative ideation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that a close look at criticality could point to undiscovered tendencies or talents that just need an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they never tried art, but we can see that the potential is there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Hengen, Shew, and others are spreading the word about the importance of criticality. Hengen presented a TEDx talk on the subject in 2024 and shared his work at Arts &amp;amp; Sciences’ inaugural research pitch competition, where he took second place. He hopes the new Neuron paper will inspire conversations among neurologists, doctors, reporters and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unified theory of the mind could change the world, but first, it must unify the experts. “Woody (Shew) and I really think we’re on to something here,” Hengen said. “And, perhaps slowly, others are starting to agree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WashU was the ideal place for a new concept of the brain to emerge, Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re surrounded by brilliant people in diverse fields, including physics, biology, psychology, mathematics and neuroscience, and the community here is remarkably supportive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is ready to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory, learning, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e5f0fdf8f0bffef6fdf8fee3f4d1e6e4e2e5fdbff4f5e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Talia Ogliore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Talia Ogliore – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.05.020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?&lt;/a&gt;” by Keith Hengen et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains face selective pressure to optimize computation, broadly defined. This is achieved by mechanisms including development, plasticity, and homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a universal optimum around which the healthy brain tunes itself, across time and individuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticality hypothesis posits such a setpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticality is a state imbued with internally generated, multiscale, marginally stable dynamics that maximize the features of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental support emerged two decades ago and has accumulated at an accelerating pace despite disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we lay out the logic of criticality as a general computational endpoint and review experimental evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We perform a meta-analysis of 140 datasets published between 2003 and 2024. We find that a long-standing controversy is the product of a methodological choice with no bearing on underlying dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a new generation of research can leverage criticality—as a unifying principle of brain function—to accelerate understanding of behavior, cognition, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:15:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1yeDVpcHRadnNta0ZVREZTTlJEeFVJT3dHblJCbkowa21ORG0ydTlWcnJDV3FJMlM2S3JLWmdHQ25pbmEwU1NJOWVBU2pPT3I2dHEzQ2xRZUM2N2dXbmR2aHJGNXlTVU5MclNwM25QUmwxenFMUzhxUGc5MA</guid></item><item><title>13年前，一位女性被告知她患有阿尔茨海默氏症。现在她在逆转病情后走遍了美国的广阔地带-雅虎 | A woman was told she had Alzheimer’s 13 years ago.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr LeBrett said acid reflux—which causes problems like heartburn— can be a hidden condition with up to a third of sufferers not suffering 'typical symptoms'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oesophageal cancer, a disease of the tube in the throat that carries food to the stomach, is often caught too late due to easy to dismiss symptoms like heartburn or a sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Watch out for a chronic cough, particularly at night when acid reflux is worse,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Breathing problems can also be a symptom as the acid irritates the airways and can exacerbate conditions like asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Problems swallowing is also an atypical symptom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medic also explained that dentists may spot signs of acid damage to your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs include yellowing of teeth as well as cracks and increased sensitivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She urged anyone frequently experiencing these symptoms to seek help from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commenter on the video said: 'I was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer last year. I’m 36. I’ve had acid reflux most of my life but never thought anything of it. I had all those symptoms you mention but was gaslit and dismissed by my doctors.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While another viewer said that: 'not me having a chronic cough because of my acid, getting it checked next Monday.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may be able to advise on lifestyle changes or prescribe medication and investigations to combat the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated acid reflux can lead to a condition called Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is where cells in the tube have started to change abnormally and are at higher risk of becoming cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates between 3 and 13 per cent of Barrett's oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translate to someone with the condition having an 11-times greater risk of being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer than someone without Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, CRUK estimates about three in five of the near 9,500 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed in Britain each year are preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is considered one of the biggest risk factors for the disease with about one in three cases of the cancer in Britain caused by the habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to heartburn and indigestion a sore throat, especially when swallowing, is another common sign of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are urged to get it checked out by a doctor if they notice it getting worse or remaining for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also suggests that oesophageal is on the rise in Britain with cases having increased 3 per cent overall since the 90s and 10 per cent in men specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year figures showed Britain has one of the highest rates of the disease in Europe with medics warning cases, like other cancers, are on the rise among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer kills 22 patients per day in the UK, one of the highest rates in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data show the UK has 14.2 new cases of oesophageal cancer per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is quadruple Italy's 3.5 cases per 100,000 people per year, triple Spain's 4.4 and double or almost double France's and Germany rate of 7 and 7.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only the Netherlands narrowly beats Britain in Western Europe, sneaking ahead at 14.9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Action Against Heartburn, the campaign group that analysed the data called for greater awareness of oesophageal cancer in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:55:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPT25mMFZoV2VZWnlXSDg4WDZFMjZNbkc1Z3BoZU40MHhQaXUwZmJGal95M2FyWnc3eENURlZaelFTT2lDRHp2SFFvN1pIakJzU0FsUzd0SmY5bWxJU1RIR2xyMkJrYldmTFdGUlhuUE1IcHJYS0dLbUdack5haENrTkhJdlIwSjFrWnYwSzdwa2JuRTR1MTBkRDVpN2dnZ9IBowFBVV95cUxPSFk5TTJWMWllbVhFUDZHWVJkNkNyY3Ryb2wxV0xnOFZoM0VvWFR5MEJyMW5ING9Dck5EREk2dTJPVk5PaGlKMnpOX2lDSElOcTUzT0REZjVDRU03YUhTU0JmSm81M2N5YXNRRXZTWnZvQlpKWVlGejIxMHhfZURWSjc2RmpheVMwcnZPNEt6OVV1R215dDdiNTlSVl9YQ1ZxLW5N</guid></item><item><title>忘记东西是“正常”老化还是更糟糕的事情？了解详情的第一步-《旧金山纪事报》 | Is forgetting things ‘normal’ aging or something worse?

Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

This might manifest as confusion when making &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/175119/alzheimers-warning-20-years"&gt;change during a purchase or repeatedly using the incorrect payment card.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This difficulty is often linked to impairments in planning, organizing, and executing tasks, which can affect even commonplace activities." Dr. John emphasized that these challenges are a "clear signal" that one should seek medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pay closer attention to daily functioning," Dr. John recommended, noting that "I've noted I.T. is sometimes overlooked because it can start subtly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow progression of dementia symptoms is often missed until they become more pronounced. "Increasing awareness is vital," Dr. John stated, underscoring his commitment to educating people about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "The more symptoms we observe – say, memory lapses combined with changes in visual or spatial perceptions – the stronger the likelihood of dementia. It's been my experience that a mixture of symptoms should prompt an evaluation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A timely visit to a healthcare provider, particularly one specializing in neurology, might lead to positive outcomes. Dr John shared insights from his experience: "In my practice, I've seen the benefits of addressing these concerns early on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized the advantages of early intervention: "It often provides the opportunity to manage the condition more effectively with appropriate lifestyle adjustments and medications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr John further noted: "While dementia progresses differently for everyone, on average, it can take several years from the first noticeable symptoms to more severe stages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed out the role of current treatments: "Modern medications can delay worsening symptoms for a period, often extending quality of life for months, sometimes years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also highlighted the importance of comprehensive care: "Coupled with preventive care strategies, these treatments offer real hope to patients and families looking to manage heart and brain health over the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS outlines various early signs of dementia, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being confused about time and place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease are also identified:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory problems, such as regularly forgetting recent events, names and faces&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asking questions repetitively&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require organisation and planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Becoming confused in unfamiliar environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty finding the right words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty with numbers and/or handling money in shops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Becoming more withdrawn or anxious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:32:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPS2plUXZBVzZwVmRBZUZuRmdSMGlzcTMxZE82eGFQRklibGdtWnNVblhscWkyck9ScDR1LXUwNU1kXzRELXNRdWg5MzNabTNUUHp5YjlZc1pzQnVxSkltc3lTN09rLVVLYXVJbXFXa2cybGgzVmV3Y0w5MUZIdUZ6d2RvSW52VmtTcWkwV2d5MWk0TVNyajJ2Q2lxUGZPV0YzM1lpTkVCX1pQRWlHZmfSAbMBQVVfeXFMT0NIa2NnZkVmeGRabXlXeTBVcGZHeE1rOGFobG5Zdk05QWU4R0NVVURMYkZnSmdjSzlfM1F0TG5BaUZwOVYwOHVKTGNWWTNxSUlPNktLQ2pkMDVPMWdQSFVEcHpHNnBFbnF0MEs3UGIzWUxwVVA5S0tnZGlzamhVbmxPM1VLWHdOelc1VlBQOFRVcHFFeS0wWmFEN3J4TTRvWHNaSmg5WlplcEQ0Q1ZqSlZrVUE</guid></item><item><title>23名医生对他们的病人说了一些粗鲁、残忍或令人讨厌的话- BuzzFeed | 23 Doctors Who Said Something Crass, Cruel, Or CRINGEY To Their Patients - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBFZDFaU1l6a3UtN2xfY1ZlUWpjSXNTeXNtU19PT3RldklIMk5OSjdrVmwzWGItclZrMXVKd0Y4SUk0d0JNUGN5UHhoTEJVZ3VBbVZTYURZMkJIemxYTFcteXNTVlpGSDU3MGJOWm1lOTk1NVhxVzQzeA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Across 21 experiments involving nearly 10,000 participants, researchers found that people’s prior beliefs influence the search terms they use, and in turn, the search engines’ narrow focus on “relevance” reinforces those beliefs. Even when people aren’t actively seeking to confirm their views, the structure of traditional and AI-powered search tools can trap them in informational echo chambers. The study also shows that relatively simple changes to how search algorithms present information can help break this pattern, encouraging belief updating and broader understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The inspiration for this research came from a personal experience,” said study author Eugina Leung, an assistant professor of marketing at the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University. “I was visiting my co-author, Oleg Urminsky, at the University of Chicago. It was at the end of November, and I came down with a cold. As I was searching Google for cold medicine, I started paying close attention to the exact words I was using.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that searching for ‘cold medicine side effects’ gave me a very different, and much more alarming, set of results than searching for ‘best medicine for cold symptoms.’ It became clear how my own framing of the search was dramatically shaping the information I received, and that led us to investigate this phenomenon more systematically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors wanted to test whether the problem lies more in how algorithms deliver results or in the behavior of users themselves. They also wanted to know if anything could be done to reverse this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers designed a series of experiments that examined how people search for information, how those searches affect their beliefs, and whether belief change could be promoted by changing either the user’s approach or the platform’s algorithm. Participants took part in studies involving health topics such as caffeine and food risks, as well as broader domains like energy, crime, bitcoin, gas prices, and age-related thinking ability. The studies included real-world platforms like Google, Bing, and ChatGPT, as well as custom-built search engines and AI chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set of studies focused on what the researchers call the “narrow search effect.” Participants were asked to report their beliefs on various topics and then come up with their own search terms to learn more. Coders who didn’t know what the study was about rated those search terms on a scale to determine whether they were neutral, or biased toward confirming or disconfirming the participant’s beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, people who thought caffeine was healthy tended to search for things like “benefits of caffeine,” while those with more skeptical views searched for “caffeine dangers.” This happened across many topics, including gas prices, crime, and nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that these belief-driven search terms led to different search results—and that those results influenced people’s beliefs after they searched. In one experiment, participants were randomly assigned to search either “nuclear energy is good” or “nuclear energy is bad.” Because they were randomly assigned, the researchers could assume both groups started with similar average beliefs. Yet after reading the results from their assigned search terms, their beliefs shifted in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the differences in belief didn’t just come from being told what to search. In a follow-up study, participants were shown identical search results, even though they thought the results matched their search terms. Their beliefs didn’t change, suggesting that it was the content of the search results—not the assigned terms—that shaped their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then explored whether these shifts in belief had real-world consequences. In one study, Dutch undergraduates were asked to search for either the risks or benefits of caffeine, then offered a choice between a caffeinated or decaffeinated energy drink. Those who searched for benefits were not only more positive about caffeine afterward—they were also more likely to choose the caffeinated drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important takeaway is that we all create our own mini ‘echo chambers’ without even realizing it,” Leung told PsyPost. “Our existing beliefs unconsciously influence the words we type into a search bar, and because search engines are designed for relevance, they show us results that confirm our initial belief. This happens across many topics, from health to finance, and on all platforms, including Google and new AI chatbots. While telling people to do follow-up searches doesn’t fix it, our research shows that designing search algorithms to provide broader, more balanced viewpoints is a very effective solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just to be clear, we believe there is value in getting narrow, hyper-relevant results in many situations. However, we propose that giving people an easy option to see broader perspectives, like a ‘Search Broadly’ button as a counterpart to Google’s ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ button, would be an incredibly beneficial step toward creating a more informed society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined potential interventions. Could simply encouraging people to do more searches help? In one experiment, participants were prompted to do a second round of searching. But doing more searches didn’t help much—people stuck to their initial biases, using similar search terms that returned similarly one-sided results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tested a cognitive nudge. Some participants were asked to consider how their beliefs might differ if they had used a different search term. This helped a little—those who thought about the potential influence of their search term beforehand showed slightly more openness to new information. But the effect was limited, and didn’t eliminate the bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most promising results came from changing the algorithms themselves. In several studies, the researchers used a custom search engine that looked and felt like Google but showed either the user’s original search results or a mixture that included balanced perspectives. For instance, someone who typed “caffeine health benefits” might see results not only about benefits, but also about risks. These broader results consistently led to more moderate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study involving the relationship between age and thinking ability, participants saw either results tailored to their own search or a broader set reflecting both positive and negative perspectives. Those who saw the broader information were more likely to revise their beliefs, even though they found the results just as relevant and useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers extended this idea to AI chatbots as well. In one experiment, they designed two versions of a chatbot based on ChatGPT. One version gave narrow answers focused on what the user asked. The other gave broader, more balanced answers, including pros and cons. Even though both chatbots used the same base model, the one offering broader answers led to greater belief updating. People who saw the broad responses rated them as equally useful and relevant as the narrower ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was how well people responded to the broadened search results,” Leung said. “There’s an assumption in the tech world that users demand hyper-relevant, narrowly-focused information, and that giving them anything else would be seen as less useful or frustrating. However, our studies consistently found that this wasn’t true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we gave people a more balanced set of search results or a broader AI-generated answer, they rated the information as just as useful and relevant as the people who received narrow, belief-confirming results. This is optimistic because it means platforms can potentially contribute to a more informed public without sacrificing user satisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the limitations of relying solely on individual self-awareness to fix the problem. Most people didn’t realize they were searching narrowly. In fact, only a small portion said they had used their search terms to confirm their beliefs. This suggests that the problem isn’t just deliberate bias—it’s a product of natural tendencies and how search platforms respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to be clear about the specific conditions where this effect is most powerful,” Leung noted. “As we lay out in the paper, the ‘narrow search effect’ and the benefits of broadening search results are most likely to occur under a specific set of circumstances: First, users need to hold some kind of prior belief, even a subtle one, that influences the search terms they choose. Second, the search technology must actually provide different, narrower results depending on the direction of the query. And third, users’ beliefs on the topic must be malleable enough to be updated by the information they receive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means our findings may not apply in every situation. For instance, if a major news event creates a shared, prominent cue, everyone might search using the exact same term, regardless of their personal beliefs. Similarly, for topics where information is scarce or already cleaned up by the search platforms, different search terms might lead to the same balanced results anyway. And for identity-defining political beliefs, people may be highly resistant to changing their minds, no matter what information they are shown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the findings point to a need for design strategies that balance relevance with informational breadth. If the default settings of our digital tools consistently show us what we already believe, belief polarization may become harder to undo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our overarching goal is to use these insights to help design a healthier and more robust information ecosystem,” Leung explained. “We plan to pursue this in a few directions: First, we want to go deeper into the psychology of the searcher. We’re interested in understanding who is most susceptible to this effect and why. Second, we hope to figure out how to apply these principles to highly polarized topics and areas plagued by misinformation. How can we design systems that broaden perspectives without amplifying harmful or dangerous content?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we hope this line of research helps create a new standard for search and AI design – one that accounts for human psychology by default to create a more shared factual foundation for society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s crucial to understand that this isn’t just about ‘filter bubbles’ being created for us by algorithms; it’s also about the echo chambers we unintentionally create ourselves through our search habits,” Leung added. “The good news is that the solution doesn’t require us to rewire our brains. Instead, we can make simple but powerful design changes to the technology we use every day. With thoughtful design, the same AI and search tools that risk reinforcing our biases can become powerful instruments for broadening our perspectives and leading to more informed decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2408175122" target="_blank"&gt;The narrow search effect and how broadening search promotes belief updating&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eugina Leung and Oleg Urminsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:03:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQMnlaUGtHNE52d3VrTDFfUTA2eHJKRHlJVFpiVzJNTVlNNHdRXzNqcFBNY1hHQ2F6SkdlY1VNZTM3Rzh0cXpudmk3OEM0ZFZtaDIwM3dXbDRRelV2cTNLbHF3RVV6cmk1bFpZLURMUjdpTDFKR3hYY0NqUkdySkV5SkkwV1NidWh1SFhGSE5uUnVJUUV0bWw4MUxRVjY4TG9ObHdUQlJUSQ</guid></item><item><title>除了生育和更年期：了解为什么卵巢对女性的健康和长寿至关重要-今日美国 | Beyond fertility and menopause: See why the ovary is central to women’s health and longevity - USA Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQUXlsTXJaVE81eXpWb3hQRFFpUDdiZmFwSGU0MmpGUEFwVUsxZ1VhX0xRXzNkVC1CSGFDRmhmXzlvak4wRUliRU83VzlKSl9od2pvSlBjcEJwT1N5ZkpmUmRYV3FQMGtRUUIxSXhhVGNSb1FQMU9DNjdBLWwyeVhoT2l1VGR6VDBPS0ZTM2dvMU1sUnBKUjNlYjdWYVNmM3U3ZUtCTFBDSTZURmVTd1c4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though the ovary is often reduced to its role in reproduction, research shows it plays a surprisingly central role in a woman’s health throughout her body and lifetime. It is becoming more important as women live longer − it ages more than twice as fast as other organs, and its decline doesn’t just impact fertility. Ovarian aging has widespread effects on women’s health, increasing the risk of age-related diseases and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here's a closer look at why the ovary affects health, how you can stay healthier longer, and ways researchers are trying to better understand this often-overlooked but crucial organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Living longer, but not necessarily better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women live longer than men on average, but they end up &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;spending more time living with diseases or disabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that health outcomes are closely tied with menopause and declining ovarian function. Before reaching menopause, women are less likely than men of the same age to develop cardiovascular disease, but once they reach 55, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2894539/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their risk becomes greater than men’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The risk of dying from a cardiovascular event is higher for women who experience menopause earlier in life, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a study in the Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5177476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that experiencing menopause later in life made it more likely someone would live to 90 and that earlier menopause increased the risk of dying younger. And a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/2/2/fcaa185/5977090?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;paper published in the journal Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt; showed women with longer reproductive windows were better protected against progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It’s not only deadly diseases that are linked to ovarian health; women also experience &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550857906801981?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more chronic, non-life-threatening illness&lt;/a&gt; than men after age 45.  As ovaries age, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/108/8/1835/7192004?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline increases.&lt;/a&gt;  Some experts say that delaying ovarian aging could help women avoid a cascade of health problems and live healthier longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Why is it OK to extend our lifespan as much as we are and not try to live healthier longer? And I think for women, this discussion of health span really has to include reproductive function,” said Francesca Duncan, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How do ovaries work?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At birth, an ovary contains anywhere from &lt;a href="https://johnsonlab.github.io/blog-post-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;100,000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79488-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;to 2 million&lt;/a&gt; tiny fluid-filled sacs called follicles. Each follicle holds an immature egg and cells that support the egg's development. The number of follicles varies greatly, but one thing is certain: Every woman is born with all of the follicles she will ever have. Only &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128132098000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;about 300,000&lt;/a&gt; may remain by the time she reaches puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The path from follicle to egg is remarkably long. While we think of the menstrual cycle as a monthly event, a woman's period is more than a year in the making. At any moment, there is a lot happening in the ovary − some follicles are just beginning their recruitment process (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28723025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;about 1,000 are recruited&lt;/a&gt; each month), others are growing, and a few are nearing maturity. This ongoing, overlapping cycle makes ovarian function complex and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;From each cohort of about 1,000 follicles, only one typically reaches maturity and ovulates, releasing an egg for fertilization. The others are degraded by the ovary. Why certain follicles survive remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s like a ball of balls, little tiny different-size balls, and each one of those different balls is going through this incredible remodeling at the level of cells. They change what kind of hormones they make, they change the way they look, they change what their function is across time,” said Jennifer Garrison, an associate professor based at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the Center for Healthy Aging in Women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A symphony of hormones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Despite being known as reproductive organ, the ovary does much more, Garrison said. “I genuinely do think that calling them reproductive organs has really made women’s health small. Focusing it through the lens of fertility has really made it seem small, and we have to make it clear that we are talking about the health of women, period.“  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Only about 400 to 500 follicles release an egg during a woman’s life. Thousands of others die off, but before they do, the supporting cells inside produce hormones. These hormones communicate with their egg and with the ovary, regulating the menstrual cycle, but also have many other functions enabled by receptors throughout the body. Traveling through the bloodstream to the brain, bones, blood vessels, breasts and other organs with receptors, hormones affect bone and heart health, metabolism and overall well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Garrison studies these two-way dynamic chemical conversations and likens the process to a symphony in which hormones act as notes, creating an interplay between ovaries and organs. “Your ovaries are communicating via hormones, and not just the ones you know about but probably dozens if not hundreds of hormones talking to your bones, to your brain, to your liver, talking to your muscle, talking to almost every other organ in your body.” As ovaries decline, hormones change, and a harmonious symphony can turn into a cacophonous noise, impacting the entire body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We don't understand those individual conversations. We have no idea how most of them work. But what we do know is what happens when either ovaries aren't working properly, or when you take them away, and so we can infer what the contribution of ovaries is to say, for example, bone density,” Garrison said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Take one of the hormones ovaries produce: estrogen. Estrogen is essential to bone health because it promotes the activity of osteoblasts, the cells that make new bone. During menopause, women lose about 10% of their bone density on average, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5643776/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;some could lose up to 20%&lt;/a&gt; in the first five years. A drop in estrogen also affects &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;skeletal muscle mass and strength,&lt;/a&gt; increasing the risk of fractures from falls.  After age 50, as many as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328201006147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;1 in 2 women (but only 1 in 5 men)&lt;/a&gt; break a bone. &lt;a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-024-00418-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; postmenopausal women, particularly those with early menopause, may be at higher risk for rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen also influences many areas of the brain. Longer exposure to estradiol, the type of estrogen produced by the ovaries during a woman's reproductive years, may help keep the brain healthier and lower the risk of certain diseases. For example, earlier menopause is associated with increased risk of dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00210-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a 2023 study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women are protected from heart disease during their reproductive years because estrogen helps expand blood vessels, grow new ones and lower inflammation. Better blood flow reduces strain on the heart, and wider blood vessels reduce resistance in circulation, leading to lower blood pressure. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074318/#:~:text=Women%20develop%20heart%20diseases%20later,after%20menopause%20in%20most%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the risk of heart disease increases&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8554369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;helps regulate blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; by supporting insulin production, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing fat storage and inflammation. The hormone also plays a role in maintaining brain function and metabolism, ensuring the body uses glucose for energy efficiently. The drop in estrogen associated with menopause makes it more likely that women will gain weight around the abdomen, increasing the risk of conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What goes wrong with ovaries over time? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The number of follicles progressively declines with age. By age 30, most women have &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;only about 12%&lt;/a&gt; of the egg cells they were born with. After a certain point they lose follicles at a faster rate, though it’s not known why. By age 40, a mere 3% may remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The quality of follicles also worsens with age, and they are more likely to have defects. For example, if a follicle releases an egg, the egg might have missing chromosomes or have too many, which makes it harder to get pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Countless cycles of follicular growth also leave their mark on ovaries. A thousand follicles dying so that one can make it to the final stage means there is a lot of debris for the body to clean up. Many other organs experience more gradual wear and tear with age, but the ovary has an immense degree of cellular turnover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As a follicle reaches ovulation, it ruptures to release an egg, leaving a temporary wound behind on the surface of the ovary, which must then heal. According to Duncan, this process normally occurs hundreds of times in a woman’s life, and over time these micro-injuries degrade the ovary’s structural integrity affecting its function. All of this means the ovary becomes stiffer with age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It's maybe not so stark as a sponge to a rock,” Duncan said. “But that's the idea, that you're going from something that's very soft to something that's very rigid and tough.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As all of these issues accumulate the once tightly regulated system where hormones fluctuate in predictable cycles begins to break down. That’s when perimenopause begins, a phase that can last for a decade before menstruation stops completely. The body is no longer receiving the level of hormones it has been accustomed to since puberty. Many women start having hot flashes, have trouble sleeping and experience vaginal dryness. Some experience mood changes and brain fog. As many as 135 different symptoms are associated with perimenopause and can come at various intensities. Ultimately this phase is followed by menopause, defined as 12 full months since a woman's last menstrual period. By that time, a woman has about 1,000 follicles remaining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5558404/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Many things can influence&lt;/a&gt; when a woman will reach menopause: not only her mother’s age at menopause but the timing of her first period, her body mass index, lifestyle choices, use of birth control, number of pregnancies, and other factors like education and income level. Women with cancer going through chemotherapy or radiation often have accelerated ovarian aging. Endocrine disrupting chemicals &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39222443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;may also cause a woman to go through menopause earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The end of periods doesn’t mean the ovaries stop working; they &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2022.2141618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;continue to make&lt;/a&gt; estrogen at much lower levels as well as testosterone. Rather, menopause means the end of menstruation and fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Some women will be postmenopausal and for whatever reason be advised to have their ovaries removed surgically, and they can feel the difference,” said Cynthia Stuenkel, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ovarian problems can affect a woman's health at any age. For a 10-year-old girl, ovarian dysfunction could mean trouble going through puberty, irregular menstrual cycles, or even acne. Garrison says that for a woman in her 20s, it might uncover risks of autoimmune disorders or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. By the time a woman reaches her 30s, ovarian problems are more commonly linked to infertility and miscarriages. And after menopause, the risks shift again − heart disease, osteoporosis and cognitive decline become bigger concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done to manage ovarian decline? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lifestyle changes are probably the most important tools, Stuenkel said. Regular exercise − especially strength training − &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9864448/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;helps protect bone and muscle health,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10780928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;a good diet can help counteract metabolic changes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also important to manage stress and get enough sleep. Though lifestyle changes can’t stop ovarian aging, they can ease the transition and lower long-term health risks. There are also many options for managing symptoms, such as &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/wp-content/uploads/professional/2023-nonhormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;nonhormonal drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hormone therapy is another option. The treatment seeks to &lt;a href="https://but/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;replicate ovarian function&lt;/a&gt; by replenishing hormones depleted during menopause. It is most often used to treat hot flashes and vaginal discomfort. The therapy was prescribed for decades before its use dropped sharply in 2002 after a &lt;a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3mr6f93p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study&lt;/a&gt; linked it to slightly higher risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2818206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;In May 2024, a review highlighted&lt;/a&gt; that the hormones, doses and delivery methods used in the WHI trials were different from modern treatments. Unlike the oral-only therapy in the study, today's patches use lower doses of hormones which are identical to the ones made by the body, and may reduce risks, according to the review. The timing also matters - most WHI participants started therapy a decade after menopause, which may have affected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Starting hormone replacement closer to menopause may be much more effective, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1505241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to another study&lt;/a&gt;. Though hormone therapy may benefit heart health if started early in menopause, it's generally not recommended for women who already have a high risk of heart disease, stroke or a history of coronary problems, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a review led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee.&lt;/a&gt; But &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00270-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;research indicates&lt;/a&gt; long-term benefits of the therapy could outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The treatment does have its limits: Estrogen and progesterone in premenopausal women are tightly regulated in cycles, but hormone replacement therapy provides a constant dosage while wearing a patch, or a spike when taking a pill. Also, estrogen receptors, which can be compared to locks on cells with estrogen being the key that activates them, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10327608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;may decrease with age.&lt;/a&gt; This means that even if estrogen is available via replacement therapy, cells may be less responsive to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How can women keep track of what’s going on with their ovaries?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unlike other organs where function can be measured with routine tests, there is no simple diagnostic tool to track ovarian aging. The biggest clue is something most women are already familiar with: their period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regular cycles signal ovaries are producing hormones in a predictable rhythm, while irregular or skipped periods can be an early indication of decline. For many women, the first sign of approaching menopause isn’t a sudden change but a slow and erratic shift in their cycles. &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/od/directors_corner/prev_updates/menstrual-cycles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menstrual irregularities can also indicate&lt;/a&gt; stress, hormonal imbalances, gynecological diseases and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Vital signs in medicine are things like heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and temperature,” Stuenkel said. “Those are the key. When we get a new patient in the hospital, the attendants say, 'Tell me the vital signs.' I really like the concept of the menstrual cycle as a vital sign because it tells you so much about women's health.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But women who take hormonal contraception may not experience obvious menstrual changes at all, and those who have conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome may already have irregular periods. There are also women with regular periods who want to know how fertile they are. In this case, doctors measure the level of Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is made by follicles. They can also check the antral follicle count (AFC), or the number of follicles, in the later part of their journey toward possible ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to Garrison, current methods provide only a snapshot rather than a complete picture of a woman's ovarian health trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Can women delay ovarian aging? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts say that reproductive aging is greatly under-researched. A lack of suitable organisms to model and study human menopause makes it challenging to develop interventions, as does &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-024-00253-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sex bias and lack of funding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This touches every single person with ovaries. It's a tremendous problem, and there's a tremendous opportunity,” said Kara Goldman, associate professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility and director of fertility preservation at Northwestern Medicine. “But there aren't that many people focusing on it, and the funding is very limited. And so, I think that the progress will be halted if there isn't proper funding to continue this work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An emerging trend known as decentralized science is exploring ways to raise money for early-stage research through community-driven efforts. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.athenadao.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;AthenaDAO&lt;/a&gt; − a self-described decentralized community of researchers, funders and advocates − is funding research on women’s health, including ovarian aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are only a handful of companies focused on reproductive longevity. One of them is &lt;a href="https://www.ovivatx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Oviva Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the early stages of testing whether a pharmaceutical version of anti-Müllerian hormone, which helps regulate how many follicles start developing each menstrual cycle, could help reduce egg loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some scientists are exploring compounds that may show promise in other areas of aging and applying them to ovarian health. Rapamycin is an antifungal approved by the FDA as an immune suppressor that prevents organ recipients from rejecting a new organ. Rapamycin prolonged life when given to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19458476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;yeast,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;worms,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00278-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;flies and mice&lt;/a&gt; and has raised hopes of possibly slowing down the aging process in humans. One study is testing whether it can slow ovarian aging, delay menopause, extend fertility and reduce risks of age-related disease. The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; plans to include more than 1,000 women and has 50 participants so far. Early results suggest rapamycin could slow ovarian aging by 20%. Participants have reported better health, memory, energy, and skin and hair quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duncan, the professor at Northwestern, is focused on using ovarian stiffness as a way to track ovarian aging through noninvasive imaging and as a target for treatment. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01322-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Her research shows&lt;/a&gt; that reducing fibrosis in the ovary with medication may help preserve hormone production, improve ovulation and possibly slow ovarian decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another strategy could be ovarian cryopreservation. A small piece of ovarian tissue is frozen and later replaced, a technique used to preserve fertility in cancer patients. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11625473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Mathematical models suggest&lt;/a&gt; the procedure could significantly delay menopause. But obtaining and freezing ovarian tissue requires surgery, which could carry risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;More research is needed to understand the future of women’s health &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women who go through menopause after 55 have a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cancer/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;breast,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ovarian-cancer/causes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ovarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6560333/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;endometrial&lt;/a&gt; cancers. This is likely because they have been exposed to estrogen for a longer time. The risk may be higher for women who started their periods early, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3488186/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Institute of Health's National Library of Medicine. Other risks of delaying ovarian aging may remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This is why we have to study it. And I think that the assumption is that the benefits of prolonged ovarian function would far outweigh the risks,” Goldman said. “We need to be able to offer treatments to women when they ask, ‘I understand that my ovaries are aging; what can I do about it?’ And my answer right now is there is not much we can do, and we are studying, and we are working, and we want to answer these questions, but we don't have answers.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another concern about delaying ovarian aging is the assumption that it could mean women have periods and remain fertile in the later decades of life, even if their bodies may no longer be able to support a pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We're not trying to just extend this function just so people can have a million babies, but to really make sure that the endocrine function is matching how long we are living,” Duncan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ovarian aging could be an area where a personalized approach may make a big difference. For example, women could take molecules that act like estrogen but are designed to target only certain tissues − supporting bone, brain and muscle while avoiding unwanted effects on breast tissue, according to Garrison. She imagines a future when instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, women could take a combination of compounds tailored to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“There should be a diagnostic panel that would tell you like, here's what's most likely to work for you, and there should be a menu of options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contributing: Ramon Padilla and Shawn J.

But recent research has started painting a more complex picture. It turns out, uric acid may be quietly playing a bigger role in some of today’s most serious health concerns: sudden heart attacks and metabolic syndrome. This isn’t fearmongering. It’s a call to look deeper into the body’s biochemistry and rethink what has been brushed aside as a minor lab result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly said that uric acid is just a byproduct of purine metabolism, something the kidneys flush out. That’s true. But there’s more to the story. When levels go high (called hyperuricemia), it starts to behave like an inflammatory chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8019370/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have observed that high uric acid levels may trigger oxidative stress in blood vessels. This inflammation can silently damage the endothelium (the inner lining of the arteries), setting the stage for heart disease long before symptoms appear. So, it’s not just about joints hurting, this silent buildup might be weakening the heart too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What connects uric acid to sudden heart attacks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common belief is that heart attacks only come from cholesterol and blocked arteries. While that’s partly true, studies now show that people with high uric acid are at a significantly higher risk for sudden cardiac events, even if their cholesterol levels seem fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

These tiny blockages often don’t show up in regular scans but can starve the heart of oxygen. The result? A sudden heart attack with no prior warning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37750373/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; even found that high uric acid was independently associated with heart attack risk, especially in people who seemed metabolically healthy otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metabolic syndrome: The complex puzzle that uric acid might fit into&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of problems: high blood sugar, belly fat, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol. For a long time, uric acid was seen as a “passenger” in this picture. Now, experts believe it may be driving the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2724243/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Dr Richard Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a kidney disease researcher from the University of Colorado, has suggested that uric acid might trigger insulin resistance, a key step in the development of metabolic syndrome. That means even before blood sugar starts climbing or weight increases, uric acid might be quietly flipping switches in the background, disrupting how the body processes food and stores energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

But replacing some salt with potassium-rich ingredients like coconut water or banana in moderation may support excretion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night-time breathers: Slow breathing or 10-minute meditative pauses before bed have shown to lower stress-induced spikes in uric acid, indirectly helping cardiovascular health too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Metabolic Syndrome &amp;amp; Obesity: What You Need to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking “normal” uric acid ranges&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab reports consider uric acid levels up to 7.0 mg/dL as normal. But according to some cardiologists, the heart may prefer it closer to 5.5 mg/dL. So, even if a lab report says “normal,” it might still be too high for someone with heart risk or metabolic imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at uric acid not just as a number, but as a marker of underlying metabolic tension, can be a smarter approach.

&lt;p&gt;Mental health can be a tricky beast: you can be doing fine one day and the next feel as though the world is crashing down around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have lived with generalized anxiety and a panic disorder for over a decade, and while I’ve grown much better at managing my symptoms with medication, mindfulness and therapy, sometimes they pop up again for no identifiable reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened to me last week, after many months of uninterrupted calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My anxiety symptoms are often very physical: manifesting as pain, an upset stomach, and heart palpitations, as well as the spinning thoughts and sense of fear usually associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even when experiencing symptoms like these, the demands of life don’t let up, and most importantly, the dog still needs walkies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having experienced periods of agoraphobia in the past, it is vitally important to me that I continue to leave the house, even just for short spells, to prevent my world from getting any smaller. Dog walks are a great way to do this, plus they squeeze a little cardiovascular exercise into my day and provide me with valuable bonding time with my pet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the mental state I was in, I needed a tool to pull my focus away from my spiralling thoughts and take some of the overwhelm away from the idea of going outside. That’s when I came across color walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wPfyP9cop2HtFiJpyrNs9C" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wPfyP9cop2HtFiJpyrNs9C slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-color-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is color walking?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind color walking is simple: you select a color and try to spot it wherever it appears on your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s TikTok creator &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jazhand" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@jazhand" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jaz Hand&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating a color walk where she seeks out the color yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add a level by taking photos of where you see the color, or just make a mental note when you observe it and take a few moments to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend encourages participants to reflect on the color, notice the exact shade, and see how it fits into the environment and interacts with other visual aspects, like light and texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, you engage with your environment and appreciate the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-color-walking-helped-me"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How color walking helped me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having successfully tried &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-walking-yoga-and-i-was-amazed-by-how-calm-it-made-me-feel" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-walking-yoga-and-i-was-amazed-by-how-calm-it-made-me-feel"&gt;walking yoga&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to try a similarly mindful practice, but one that was slightly less focused on how my body felt, because I was in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having seen some colleagues try color walking, I decided this might be a good option to try myself, so I laced up my walking shoes, leashed my dog and went out to look for yellow things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / Kosamtu)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-gave-me-something-to-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It gave me something to focus on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can give myself panic attacks while sitting in a dark room with no external stimuli—they’re a consequence of my thoughts, which can spiral out of control very easily. There isn’t always a definite trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindful practices are helpful in these situations because they interrupt the thoughts before they can spiral and fill the space in my head that would otherwise be taken up by worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing inward on my thoughts and how anxious I was feeling, I was able to think about spotting some yellow, and then some more yellow, and some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found yellow in surprising places: blue flowers with yellow centers, the flash of yellow on the tail of a green woodpecker, even some graffiti on a bin. I was so absorbed in my quest that I was able to put aside my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time I got home again, I was calmer, happier and had achieved something. All big wins on a bad mental health day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-cheered-me-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It cheered me up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose yellow because it has been my favorite color since I was small. Something about the bright shades of sunflowers, bumblebees and lemons has always lifted my mood, and it’s the color I choose to paint my nails when I’m feeling particularly sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also one of the first colors of spring where I live, appearing in daffodils and buttercups, meaning I also associate it with the promise of sunshine and longer days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking out little patches of yellow made me notice just how much of it there is in the world, which helped me to feel happier, despite my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-helped-me-manage-my-anxiety"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It helped me manage my anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety management can take many forms, and although I try to lean towards holistic techniques like mindfulness and meditation, I need medication too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taking a powerful &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24570-benzodiazepines-benzos" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24570-benzodiazepines-benzos" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; every time I want to go outside is neither practical nor healthy. They’re a dependence-building drug and one that I try not to take unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead of popping a pill before leaving the house, I started in my kitchen (the first room in my house), which is littered with yellow pots, pans, plants and crockery. I started my color walk indoors, looking for my chosen color in my own home before I took myself outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period of transition helped me to adjust to the task at hand, without feeling overwhelmed by it. By thinking of what I was doing as just “looking for the color yellow” rather than the much more intimidating “going outside where there are people, cars and all sorts of other triggers and terrible things that could go wrong,” it took some of the fear out of the experience and made it more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I relied on color walks over this horrible week until I finally began to feel more stable, and will continue to do so on difficult days to keep myself feeling calm, comfortable and maybe even a bit happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it plays a vital role in healing, chronic inflammation can contribute to serious health issues. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods like mackerel, olive oil, dark chocolate and avocados can help combat inflammation and promote overall health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple adjustments to your daily habits and meals can make a meaningful difference in reducing inflammation and supporting long-term well-being. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is an inevitable part of life. It is your body’s natural response to trauma, infections, injuries and toxins, acting as a defense mechanism to protect your health. While it may sound unpleasant, acute inflammation plays a critical role in healing by targeting foreign invaders and helping your body recover. However, when &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; lingers and becomes chronic, it can lead to serious health issues such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. Factors like excessive alcohol consumption and diets high in saturated fats can exacerbate inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that you can take steps to combat inflammation and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases. While there’s no single food that can work as a cure-all, adopting a diet inspired by the Mediterranean diet is a highly effective approach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This eating pattern prioritizes whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains, while emphasizing healthy fats from sources such as nuts, olive oil and fish. By making these dietary changes, you can give your body the tools it needs to fight inflammation and support long-term health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mackerel is an oily fish that is a source of two &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;: EPA and DHA. One study took a close look at the effects of diets rich in oily fish and their impact on inflammation in people at risk for cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and results showed that diets rich in oily fish effectively lowered plasma C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that can serve as a commonly-used sign of future cardiovascular problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moist, flaky and slightly salty describe mackerel's distinct flavor and texture. And just one 3-ounce piece delivers significant amounts of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A and choline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Holy mackerel! There's no shortage of nutrition with this fatty fish. You can top your lunch salad with flaked wild-caught mackerel from a can or grill some mackerel for dinner to keep your health at the forefront.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the years, the good news of olive oil's benefits and versatility has almost everyone drizzling it on anything from roasted root vegetables to freshly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250197/lemon-parm-popcorn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;popped popcorn&lt;/a&gt;. As a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and a key player in its inflammatory benefits, olive oil has long been studied in heart-health research.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Compared to other plant-based oils, olive oil is the richest in monounsaturated fats, which lower LDL (bad) cholesterol while raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, other data showed that dosing yourself with more than a half-tablespoon of olive oil daily could lessen the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Olive oil contains a phenolic compound called oleocanthal, which targets inflammation and other diseases, giving us yet one more reason to love olive oil.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Antioxidants, like the flavonols in chocolate, are known inflammatory fighters. That said, dark chocolate is also a source of anti-inflammatory fats. Oleic acid, the fatty acid in olive oil, makes up 33% of dark chocolate. Oleic acid has improved inflammation in multiple body organs, including the eyes, skin, lungs, digestive tract and liver. It has also been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory markers and activate the immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you need any further motivation to get your chocolate fix, we have you covered. Just make sure it's at least 70% dark chocolate; the greater the percentage, the better the anti-inflammatory power. Also, keep in mind that dark chocolate may contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8020215/consumer-reports-just-found-lead-and-cadmium-in-some-popular-dark-chocolate-brands/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;, so make sure to choose the best options and moderate your consumption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What's creamy, green on the inside and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chock-full of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like potassium and folate? Avocados! And they have gained massive popularity over the last decade (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22587/mealtimes/breakfast-brunch/toast/avocado/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;avocado toast&lt;/a&gt;). Like olive oil, this superfood fruit is a source of monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), helping to keep the heart healthy. While eating high amounts of saturated fatty acids may make you prone to inflammation, monounsaturated fats show the opposite effect. Data shows that people who follow the Mediterranean diet, which is high in MUFAs, have lower levels of inflammation than those following a typical Western diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Furthermore, avocados provide vitamin E, which functions as an antioxidant and can help reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flaxseeds are small but mighty when it comes to nutrition! These tiny seeds pack a punch of plant-based omega-3 fats, making them a fantastic addition to your diet. Known for their rich fiber content and plant lignans, or natural compounds found in a variety of plants that function as antioxidants and phytoestrogens, flaxseeds are a health powerhouse. A 2020 review in &lt;em&gt;Cytokine&lt;/em&gt; analyzed 40 studies with 2,520 participants and found that flaxseed supplementation improved inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the best results, go for ground flaxseeds so your body can fully absorb their benefits. Or try flaxseed oil when you are cooking to reap some of the benefits flaxseeds offer. Incorporating these nutrient-dense seeds into your routine is a simple and delicious way to enhance your immunity and fight inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A staple food for many vegetarians and vegans, edamame are immature soybeans that make a tasty, filling snack with a pinch of salt. While edamame is often touted for its protein and fiber, the bright green legume also contains MUFAs, polyunsaturated fats and isoflavones—a perfect storm for warding off inflammation. One cup of edamame offers significant nutrients, including choline, folate, vitamin A, calcium, lutein and zeaxanthin, for healthy vision. Soy products, especially natural ones like soybeans or soy milk, could reduce CRP levels, a key sign of inflammation, by about 9%, according to results of a meta-analysis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Health experts and researchers agree that eating tree nuts can help thwart inflammation and preserve cholesterol levels and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009337/best-snack-trader-joes-for-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as you bite into a walnut, you'll note its oily texture, which is thanks to its massive levels of good-for-you fats like omega-3s. Walnuts possess an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060840/health-benefits-of-walnuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;impressive set of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like alpha linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fun fact: walnuts are the only tree nut that is considered an “excellent” source of ALA omega-3 fatty acids.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is a natural and necessary part of your body’s defense mechanism, but chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health. The good news is that adopting a lifestyle and diet centered around anti-inflammatory foods and healthy habits can make a positive difference. By incorporating nutrient-rich options like mackerel, extra-virgin olive oil, dark chocolate, avocados, flaxseed, edamame and walnuts into your meals, you can take proactive steps to reduce inflammation and boost your overall well-being. Small, consistent changes in your diet and daily routine can empower your body to thrive and protect itself, one healthy choice at a time.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collagen supplements may support joints, but more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type II collagen is key for joint health, especially as we age and cartilage breaks down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet, exercise and weight management are proven ways to protect and support your joints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You feel it every time you go up the stairs, type an email or even make a delicious dinner—joint pain can touch almost every part of your day. It can affect just about anyone, at any time, depending on where and how it shows up. But what if there was a simple way to ease the ache—or even prevent it in the first place? According to some experts and social media, collagen can be it. So, does it actually work? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the early 2000s, that “miracle fix” seemed to be glucosamine and chondroitin. Though the combo is still commercially available and many swear by its benefits, many studies have shown that it may not make a significant difference when it comes to treating osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fast-forward today, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-collagen-11697802" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;collagen supplements&lt;/a&gt; are stealing the spotlight—thanks in part to social media influencers who tout them with great aplomb. While collagen is typically known for its skin and hair benefits, many users are also turning to it for joint health. Still, there are plenty of voices in the mix for that, too. So, what’s the real story? Can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021032/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-collagen-powder-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;collagen truly help keep your joints feeling strong&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We dug into the research and spoke with orthopedic surgeon &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/sean-peden" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sean Peden, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in foot and ankle care but has a broad understanding of orthopedics. “Everybody's looking for something that's going to affect the future,” he explains. “And I think there's some promise, both from a research and from a theoretical point of view. There are reasons to believe in it, so I think that's why it's getting popular.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-collagen-and-why-do-your-joints-need-it"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Collagen and Why Do Your Joints Need It? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body—making up around 30% of the total protein in most mammals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are 28 known types of collagen, but about 90% of it is Type I, which is found in skin, bones, muscles and connective tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Type II collagen, however, plays a key role in joint health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Type II collagen, which is a specialized form, is really what you find in articular cartilage, which means joints, and that's the one that probably were the most focused on as orthopedic surgeons, because that type, that cartilage and joints, has very little reparative capacity,” says Peden. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, once the collagen in your joints starts to break down (a natural part of aging), your body has a hard time restoring it. This can lead to familiar issues, such as stiffness, limited range of motion and chronic discomfort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Articular cartilage wear is equivalent to degenerative arthritis,” Peden explains. “This kind of cartilage has very poor ability to heal itself, especially once we are fully grown. The breakdown becomes accelerated with age, and the risk increases with things like increased body mass and trauma. As we get older, this specific cartilage increases its water content, and the collagen becomes less organized and more vulnerable to damage.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-collagen-supplements-affect-your-joints"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Collagen Supplements Affect Your Joints &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, where do supplements come in? The idea is that taking collagen—often in type II form—might encourage the body to produce more of it, helping to maintain or even rebuild cartilage. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there might be some promise, Peden says that “Many doctors aren't gung-ho about recommending it, because the data is just not there.” For instance, a small 2016 study found that after three months of treatment, collagen with acetaminophen improved knee pain more effectively than acetaminophen alone—but the sample size was small (just 39 participants), so further research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And one 2023 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; notes that while “available research suggests a clear link between collagen ingredient composition/chemical structure and mechanism of action/efficacy, further research is required, including well-designed studies, to assess the therapeutic potential of each collagen type and composition for each clinical condition.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, there really isn’t enough good research to back claims just yet. That said, Peden notes that collagen supplements are generally a safe product to take.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to try it, you’ll typically find &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067695/best-ways-to-take-collagen/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;collagen in powders, capsules or liquid form&lt;/a&gt;. Many people prefer capsules because they don’t like the flavor of liquids and powders. According to most brands, you notice any differences after taking it for 8 to 12 weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-so-is-a-collagen-supplement-right-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; So, Is a Collagen Supplement Right for You? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most healthy people, there’s little downside to trying collagen supplements. However, there are a few things to know before you start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support it with other nutrients: &lt;/strong&gt;Collagen synthesis relies on key vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C, zinc and copper.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many supplements already include these, but a well-rounded, nutrient-rich diet will help, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your source:&lt;/strong&gt; Collagen can be derived from cows, pigs, fish and eggs. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, read the label closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;/strong&gt;While collagen is considered safe—even during pregnancy—and has no significant known interactions with medications, it’s always a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-natural-ways-to-boost-collagen-and-support-joints"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3 Natural Ways to Boost Collagen and Support Joints &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more protein-rich foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Peden recommends that anyone with a musculoskeletal injury &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume sufficient protein&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, collagen is the most abundant protein in our body. “When you eat a piece of chicken, you're going to get a decent amount of collagen in there,” he says. However, he cautions that some of that collagen doesn’t get absorbed into your body. Still, eating highly collagenous foods like skin-on chicken, bone broths and whole fish, such as sardines, is a great way to get your collagen naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;Both resistance and cardio workouts help stimulate collagen production. “If you're using your muscles, the muscles are going to try to hypertrophy or get bigger,” says Peden. This helps with collagen production. If your joints are hurting, stick with low-impact exercises so they are achievable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: &lt;/strong&gt;Of course, exercise will probably have this effect, but Peden says that one of the most evidence-based ways to improve joint health is by not putting excessive weight on them. In fact, reducing body fat is one of the most effective ways to prevent osteoarthritis. According to an older study, reducing body fat can reduce the mechanical and biochemical stressors that contribute to joint degeneration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen supplements may offer some joint-friendly benefits—but they’re not a cure-all. And while more science is needed to confirm this, taking a high-quality collagen product likely won’t do harm. When choosing a supplement, make sure it's independently verified, since the FDA does not regulate them. And be sure to talk to a healthcare provider before starting to take one. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most importantly, don’t let supplements replace what we do know works: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a nutrient-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;, moving your body and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7922773/best-way-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;. “I think that the problem sometimes with supplements like this, or with any alternative treatments, is that they can kind of distract patients from the things that are evidence-based, that we know are good,” says Peden. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you find that collagen does help you, you’ll be at the forefront of a promising trend.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet is key in managing arthritis, and broccoli has earned the top spot among vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli provides vitamins C and K, the antioxidant sulforaphane and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From sautéing and roasting to making pesto, there are many ways to get more broccoli in your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From troublesome joint pain to stiffness and swelling, arthritis can be incredibly uncomfortable. It’s also extremely common, affecting about 20% of adults in the United States—a stat that increases drastically with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medication, physical therapy and staying active are all key to managing arthritis. But there’s another important piece of the puzzle that’s often overlooked—diet. Among the many foods that may help with arthritis symptoms, broccoli stands out, especially among vegetables. Packed with antioxidants, essential nutrients and a powerful compound called sulforaphane, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-benefits-8653215" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt; is a solid choice if you’re dealing with pain, inflammation and other arthritis symptoms. “Including broccoli as part of your regular eating pattern may help support long-term anti-inflammatory benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Curious what it is about broccoli that makes it a good option for those dealing with arthritis? Here’s what registered dietitians and a rheumatologist have to say.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, an essential nutrient that’s important for bone health. It also has antioxidant properties, which help protect against inflammation and other damage from free radicals. “Vitamin K supports bone health and is linked to reducing inflammatory markers in the blood,” Yeung says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found a potential connection between higher vitamin K intake and a lower risk of developing osteoarthritis.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular, low-impact physical activity can reduce pain and improve physical function for people with arthritis. It also helps keep your joints and muscles strong. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight. &lt;/strong&gt;Research shows that maintaining a healthy weight can slow the progression of arthritis symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For people with obesity, even a small reduction in weight can improve symptoms and reduce pain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “While diet alone won’t resolve arthritis symptoms, making dietary changes, like cutting back on saturated fats and added sugars and eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and unsaturated fats, can be an important part of your overall management plan,” Yeung says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support your gut health. &lt;/strong&gt;Eating lots of nutrient-rich whole foods supports a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt;, “allowing the body to better absorb and utilize nutrients that promote bone and joint health,” Han says.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8280953/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more ginger and turmeric&lt;/strong&gt;. “Ginger and turmeric both have anti-inflammatory properties and hence help reduce pain and inflammation in arthritis patients,” Medhekar says. “Turmeric is especially helpful since it contains curcumin, which has very potent anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your prescribed medication.&lt;/strong&gt; “It is important to eat healthy to help with your joint health but also important to take your prescribed medications for your arthritis,” Medhekar says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to revamp your diet to be more arthritis-friendly, incorporating broccoli is a great choice. This powerhouse vegetable provides vitamins C and K, which support collagen production and have antioxidant properties, helping protect against inflammation. Meanwhile, the fiber in broccoli helps support a healthy gut microbiome, which has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; benefits and may even lower arthritis severity. Finally, broccoli is an amazing source of sulforaphane, a compound found in many cruciferous vegetables that has been linked with reduced cartilage breakdown and inflammation, among other benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is surprisingly versatile, giving you endless options to add more to your meals. Consider roasting it, transforming it into pesto, grilling up a cheesy broccoli melt or sautéing it for an easy side dish.&lt;br&gt;

With time, the outer layer, the epidermis, thins out. It loses its ability to block external harm. Keratinocytes form most of this layer, moving upward to create the skin’s shield. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C (VC), widely known for its antioxidant power, has also been studied many times in the past for its ability to repair skin. New research adds a deeper genetic angle to its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;, shows how vitamin C thickens the skin by reactivating specific genes. It strengthens the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-skins-bacteria-could-be-a-natural-sunscreen/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; by encouraging cell renewal through epigenetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VC seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells,” explains Dr. Akihito Ishigami, Vice President at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology (&lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TMGHIG&lt;/a&gt;), who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via epigenetic changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-vitamin-c-the-basics"&gt;Understanding vitamin C – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C plays a critical role in human biology as a powerful antioxidant and essential cofactor in various enzymatic reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body uses it to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/"&gt;synthesize collagen&lt;/a&gt;, a key structural protein found in skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also assists in the production of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and aids in metabolizing certain amino acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C internally and must obtain it through diet – primarily from fruits and vegetables like oranges, kiwis, strawberries, bell peppers, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/broccoli-sprouts-have-more-nutritional-value-than-mature-broccoli/"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its structural and metabolic roles, vitamin C strengthens the immune system by supporting the function of white blood cells and enhancing skin’s barrier defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its antioxidant properties help neutralize free radicals, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-vitamin-c-thickens-skin"&gt;How vitamin C thickens skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to see how vitamin C affects &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-electronic-skin-gives-robots-the-human-touch/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; growth. But instead of testing on real human skin, they created lab-grown skin called human epidermal equivalents. These are 3D skin models that behave like real skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these models, the top layer is exposed to air, like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hormones-may-slow-skin-aging-and-reduce-wrinkles/"&gt;human skin&lt;/a&gt; facing the environment, while the bottom layer gets nutrients, just like how blood vessels nourish real skin from underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied vitamin C in two doses: 0.1 and 1.0 millimolar. After 7 days, they noticed that the living part of the skin became thicker, meaning more skin cells had grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outermost dead &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/future-tech-will-track-emotions-through-changes-in-our-skin/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; layer didn’t change at this point. But by day 14, the living layer had thickened even more, and the outer dead layer had become thinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested that vitamin C was making the skin produce more keratinocytes, which are the main cells that build the protective barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitamin-c-speeds-up-cell-division"&gt;Vitamin C speeds up cell division&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples treated with vitamin C had more Ki-67-positive cells, markers of active division and showed faster skin regeneration.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: TMIG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that vitamin C reactivates key genes by removing methyl groups from DNA. These methyl groups silence genes. Their removal allows the genes to turn on, promoting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teen-skin-bacteria-could-hold-the-secret-to-acne-prevention/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; cell growth and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-silenced-genes"&gt;Unlocking silenced genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TET enzymes carry out DNA demethylation. They transform 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step requires iron in its Fe2+ form. When iron becomes Fe3+, the process stops. Vitamin C donates electrons to turn Fe3+ back into Fe2+, keeping the process active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified more than 10,000 areas of DNA that became hypomethylated with vitamin C. Expression of 12 key genes rose between 1.6 to 75.2 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TET enzymes were blocked, the effects reversed. This confirmed the role of TET-mediated demethylation in skin thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-dna-structure-and-activity"&gt;Changing DNA structure and activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper supports these results with additional experiments. It describes how vitamin C promotes transcriptional activation by increasing chromatin accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C-treated skin showed elevated &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Chromatin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chromatin&lt;/a&gt; openness around growth-promoting genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows enrichment of open chromatin regions near gene bodies related to cell proliferation. These genes are essential in epidermal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It further proves vitamin C’s action by displaying upregulation of genes such as &lt;em&gt;DLX5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CXCL14&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;EFNA1&lt;/em&gt;. These genes promote &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/keratinocyte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;keratinocyte&lt;/a&gt; growth and skin structure organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the paper presents long-read sequencing data. This technique confirmed that vitamin C increases the expression of full-length, functional gene transcripts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strengthens the idea that vitamin C not only activates genes but does so in a way that results in usable proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-older-skin-responds-well-to-vitamin-c"&gt;Older skin responds well to vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest vitamin C can strengthen thin or aging skin. It works by restarting growth pathways that decline with age. It reactivates genes and supports cellular rebuilding at a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that VC helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation, making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults,” concludes Dr. Ishigami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study, and all of the research that preceded it, vitamin C may soon play a bigger role in daily skincare routines, not just as an antioxidant, but as a genetic rejuvenator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ishigami worked with Hokuriku University and &lt;a href="https://www.rohto.co.jp/global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Key contributors included Professors Ayami Sato, Yasunori Sato, and Toshiyuki Kimura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(25)00416-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 01:13:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNY3laX0FDOVBJaUFHNDF0TGRqcXJtRHprLVhRQXhFNGVEYjl0VVg2WGV1aWIxVlRNZ0pObmNrVURGX014dGdLclh2ZF9PWGpUelppOVhyeTBEaEgwN0VLaFZfanJzdzJEdzhOMWJvT29yTHNyUEVtdWp1dEtOQWQxYnlMcm9fLWJQNGltSVNOcUJUNG85YW1yWFJRUVNZTFE0dXVMMjI5aktCRmtoLTZtY0JWaw</guid></item><item><title>验光师分享了我们都应该停止使用的单眼产品- BuzzFeed | An Optometrist Shared The One Eye Product We Should All Stop Using - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE4xY2JVMWxGVnUtQTdzd3RPVmRCZ0YtX0Z5Rnl6eXdoT0ZTaGE2TDZOMnd4ZFNiRjR4bFZyRmFscmdJaVVnMGpBZ1c1emhza2UzT0pKaHU3bXc1ZTRyZkpzU2JrYW0tZzl6TWsw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;When your eye is irritated, as it may be with pink eye or certain allergies, the blood vessels located in the front of the eye will dilate and engorge. “That’s what causes the white part of the eye to look red and angry,” Holmes explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those blood vessels serve an important purpose — when inflamed, they indicate something is wrong, Holmes said. This could be due to a mild problem, such as a cold or dust in the eye, or it may be a symptom of a more &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/symptoms/eye-redness#:~:text=The%20white%20portion%20of%20the,infection,%20and%20other%20medical%20conditions." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;serious health condition&lt;/a&gt; like an infection, glaucoma or a corneal abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not normal to have a red, angry-looking eye,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red-eye relieving drops target these blood vessels to constrict and minimize their appearance. Temporarily, this makes the eyes white again, however, these drops could mask the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may make you think everything is OK with your eyes when really the can be something quite serious going on,” Holmes said. It’s a bandaid, not a fix, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That redness can help your eye doctor &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2010/0115/p137.html#:~:text=Red%20eye%20is%20the%20cardinal,common%20cause%20of%20red%20eye." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;detect eye diseases&lt;/a&gt;. With certain eye conditions, time is of the essence. Left untreated, they can worsen and &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/find-a-program-or-service/ophthalmology/eye-emergencies" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;lead to complications&lt;/a&gt;, including infections, and, in serious cases, vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, these drops may cause &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2021/06/eye-whitening-drops-what-you-need-know#:~:text=%22I%20do%20not%20recommend%20whitening,they%20ever%20would%20have%20been." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a rebound effect&lt;/a&gt;. “As the eye drops wear off and nutrients and oxygen start to flow back through those blood vessels, they actually will dilate and engorge more than initially,” Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can then get trapped in a cycle: their eyes appear red and irritated, they use redness-relieving drops that provide temporary relief, but then the redness comes back — this time, even worse — and they use the drops again. In some cases, people become dependent on red-eye relieving drops and the underlying health issue is never addressed, Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are other remedies you can use instead. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

On hikes with friends, she felt 'like a gorilla' was sitting on her chest as she struggled to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman assumed she just needed to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-231d51d0-4c64-11f0-a50d-830e78a05f7e" class=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; and started exercising more to get her energy back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after being rushed to the hospital in May 2019 for an undisclosed issue, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed an abnormal heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though doctors insisted 'it was probably not a big deal,' Freedman's mother urged her to get further testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiologists at NYU Langone Health performed an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart, and found obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which causes the walls of the heart to slowly thicken and block blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The one-in-500 genetic condition often causes no symptoms, leaving thousands of patients unaware they have it until they suffer heart failure or cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also the leading cause of sudden cardiac deaths in young people, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14765175/doctors-spike-americans-dead-heart-attack.html"&gt;which have surged in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rachel Freedman, pictured here, was just 26 when she was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which causes the walls of the heart to slowly thicken and block blood flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths are on the rise in young Americans. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in this age group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman, now 32, said: 'I had no idea what it was. How could I have this and not know?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart attack deaths have spiked in the US, with recent Harvard research suggesting a 17 percent increase in the years following the Covid pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those researchers found many of these attacks occurred at home, suggesting symptoms or precursors had been 'missed' until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told Freedman her heart muscle was more than 30 millimeters thick, three times more than an average healthy person's, suggesting her condition was advanced despite her being only 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This usually happens in the septum, the wall dividing the heart's two bottom chambers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This crowds the heart's main pumping chamber, making it work harder to deliver blood throughout the body and triggering erratic heartbeats that can cause cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman soon began taking medications to decrease her heart rate, lower cholesterol and relax the heart, including beta blockers, blood thinners and statins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also implanted a defibrillator into her chest three months later, which jolts the heart from an irregular rhythm back into a normal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite losing 60 pounds in a year to put less stress on her heart, her symptoms did not improve and she 'was really limited.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniele Massera, Freedman's cardiologist, said: 'She could only walk six minutes on the treadmill. At 26, you’d expect much more. She was having fainting spells despite medical therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rachel wanted to avoid surgery at all costs, but if you faint and have a diagnosis of HCM, that’s a very high-risk situation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Freedman, pictured here, said she would have to catch her breath after walking up the subway stairs, going on a grocery run and even taking a shower because her heart muscle was three times thicker than normal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Freedman underwent a septal myectomy, a type of open-heart surgery meant to remove a portion of thickened heart tissue. She is now recently married and is pursuing a master's degree. Freedman is pictured here with her husband&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2020, 15 months after her diagnosis, Freedman underwent a septal myectomy, a type of open-heart surgery meant to remove a portion of thickened heart tissue. It generally takes three to four hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, Freedman completed four months of cardiac rehabilitation, which typically involves light cardio and strength workouts and education on heart-healthy interventions like diet and quitting smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly five years later, Freedman can keep up with her friends on hikes and walk up the stairs without having to stop and catch her breath. Her chest pain is gone, and she can now walk the Brooklyn Bridge to get home instead of taking the subway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also got married in 2022 and is pursuing a master's degree to become a high school guidance counselor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman said: 'To my doctors, I'd say, "Not only did you save my life, you changed my life."' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, these grinders hide valuable dental stem cells at their core, and may prove to be critical in the treatment of several serious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That routine visit to your dentist could soon double as the first step in a personalized medical plan, now that researchers have confirmed the teeth hide stem cells with a knack for rebuilding bone, cartilage, and even nerve tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Gaskon Ibarretxe, an associate professor in the Cell Biology and Histology Department at the &lt;a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-hidden-cells"&gt;Unlocking hidden cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every wisdom tooth shelters a soft core called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39849603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dental pulp&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular pocket that keeps the tooth alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have isolated pulp‑resident cells that behave like immature body builders, able to transform into neurons, heart muscle or bone, once coaxed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibarretxe’s team recently turned pulp cells into electrically excitable neuron‑like cells, that could fire the voltage spikes that real neurons use to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That jump from marker expression to genuine electrical activity is essential, because damaged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/big-changes-in-the-brain-between-the-ages-of-11-25-and-how-it-influence-our-decisions/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; circuits need cells that can send signals,” noted Ibarretxe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harvesting-stem-cells-from-teeth"&gt;Harvesting stem cells from teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 10 million wisdom teeth are removed in the United States every year. Most head straight to a biomedical‑waste bin, yet each freshly extracted tooth offers a painless harvest of living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists usually perform these surgeries on teens or young adults, an age sweet spot when pulp cells still divide briskly and carry few DNA errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratories already partner with oral‑surgery clinics to bank teeth on dry ice, then ship them to GMP‑grade freezers where the pulp is processed and stored in liquid nitrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stemodontics.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stemodontics&lt;/a&gt;, one such service, calls the practice “biological insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dental-stem-cells-are-medical-assets"&gt;Dental stem cells are medical assets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most extracted wisdom teeth are discarded without a second thought, but some companies now offer preservation kits to turn this waste into long-term medical assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kits are sent to dental offices ahead of time and include all materials needed to keep the dental stem cells in the pulp viable during transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike embryonic or cord blood stem cells, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24850632/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dental pulp stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are collected with minimal ethical concerns, since the tissue would otherwise be thrown away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes them a practical choice for expanding access to personalized regenerative therapies, especially as the cost of stem cell banking continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dental-stem-cells-and-disease"&gt;Dental stem cells and disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre‑clinical studies show that dental‑pulp cells can ease motor symptoms in rodent models of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; disease by replacing lost dopamine‑making neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; research, the same cells secrete growth factors that protect synapses and may slow the buildup of toxic proteins. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1440334/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; outlined how pulp‑derived cells help clear amyloid plaques and calm brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical momentum is growing. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-025-00036-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recently reported early‑phase trials in which stem‑cell implants survived and released dopamine in people with Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those trials used embryonic lines, dental stem cells may offer similar benefits without the ethical baggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-personal-biobank"&gt;Building a personal biobank&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banking one’s own dental stem cells eliminates immune‑rejection worries, and can shave months off treatment timelines that would otherwise require donor matching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraction logistics are straightforward: the oral surgeon places each tooth into a sterile vial, couriers rush the package to a lab, and technicians thaw, isolate, and freeze the pulp cells in under 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upfront fee rivals that of cord‑blood banking, yet the potential payoff spans decades because adult stem‑cell lines can be expanded repeatedly for multiple therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stem-cells-used-in-multiple-health-issues"&gt;Stem cells used in multiple health issues &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the nervous system, dental stem cells build mineralized tissue faster than bone‑marrow cells, making them attractive for use in jaw repair after tumor surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists have tested dental‑pulp secretions in mice with heart failure and found improved ejection fractions, hinting at the potential for future cardiac patches grown from a patient’s own molar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orthopedic researchers see value too: in vitro, the cells lay down collagen and calcium in orderly sheets that mimic healthy cartilage, a property that could revolutionize joint‑repair grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breakthrough-therapies-for-disease"&gt;Breakthrough therapies for disease &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators still need long‑term safety data, especially because transplanted cells must integrate without forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are drafting multicenter trials that compare pulp‑cell implants with standard deep‑brain stimulation for movement disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the dental stem cells restore function and trim health‑care costs, dentists may soon hand every patient a preservation kit along with post‑op ice packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field also faces equity questions: wisdom‑tooth banking should not become a luxury limited to families who can afford elective services. Public biobanks or insurance incentives could close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is simple: before tossing those molars, consider the regenerative gold hiding inside. The next breakthrough therapy for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-a-brain-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; disease or spinal‑cord injury may start with the tooth your dentist once called an inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04134-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 23:44:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPQWxYeWN4MFdaNVQxOXRoMk9wTC1ZRl9aOUROTmdLLTZJZ0RaREotRExqYWpxZjFxRDBZaC05WEJMYmdSb0dtRm14aXdjOGtuSlY5Q0VBSjZodHR0SlEtcFZEQUxSVHh5VGtJUk03ZlFoNWM5bTNHVHRDTmRXR0hzQlpJcTF0NklyTXZzaVFFVWhJMVVoQXZTQkppY0dfMlR3bl9nS1huaE90Zw</guid></item><item><title>您的生活方式是否对肝脏有害？专家解释肝病死亡人数惊人上升-印度时报 | Is your lifestyle harming your liver?

The culprit? Liver disease. What was once primarily associated with heavy alcohol consumption is now affecting a growing number of individuals, including young adults and non-drinkers, highlighting a disturbing shift in the risk factors. The alarming rise in liver disease deaths is a stark wake-up call, with experts pointing to one major factor: our modern lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data, India records a staggering 2,68,580 liver disease deaths annually, accounting for over 18% of global liver-related fatalities. This makes India the highest contributor to liver disease deaths worldwide. This isn't just about cirrhosis from alcohol anymore; a significant driver of this trend is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver. It's now being reclassified as Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), underscoring its deep connection to metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what has changed? Dr. Aditya Verma, a consultant gastroenterologist, notes, "India is facing a silent epidemic of liver disease, and much of it is driven by what we eat. Everyday food choices can either fuel liver damage or support healing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our fast-paced, urban lifestyle has led to a dramatic change in our dietary habits and activity levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional Indian diet, rich in fiber and whole grains, has given way to a Westernized menu dominated by processed foods, refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and high-calorie junk food. This dietary shift, combined with increasingly sedentary work patterns and a lack of physical activity, is a recipe for disaster for our liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Unknown Myths About Liver Disease Busted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The culprits hiding in plain sight:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Junk food and sugary drinks: Consuming excessive amounts of processed foods, fried snacks, pastries, and soft drinks floods the liver with sugar and unhealthy fats. This excess is converted into fat and stored in the liver, leading to fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sedentary lifestyle: Prolonged sitting, whether for work or leisure, coupled with a lack of exercise, reduces the body's ability to burn fat. This contributes to obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol, all of which are major risk factors for liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Stress and sleep deprivation: Chronic stress and irregular sleep patterns are often overlooked contributors. They disrupt metabolic function and can lead to unhealthy eating habits, further impacting liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Uncontrolled metabolic conditions: Ignoring conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol accelerates liver damage. These diseases are deeply intertwined with liver health, and poor management of one can worsen the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Unnecessary medication and supplements: While the liver is a master detoxifier, it can be overburdened by the misuse of over-the-counter painkillers, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements. Always consult a doctor before taking any new medication or supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The silent progression:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous aspects of liver disease is its silent progression. In its early stages, fatty liver often presents with no symptoms. Patients may not realize their liver is in distress until the damage is severe and irreversible, progressing to inflammation, scarring (fibrosis), cirrhosis, and even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts urge people to watch out for subtle red flags, such as persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, swelling in the legs or abdomen, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). If you experience any of these symptoms, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taking charge of your liver's health:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that liver damage from lifestyle factors is often reversible in its early stages. Experts emphasize that the key lies in prevention and consistent, simple lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Eat a balanced diet: Prioritise a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit your intake of processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exercise daily: Aim for at least 30 to 45 minutes of brisk activity every day. This can be as simple as walking, jogging, or doing yoga. Regular exercise helps burn triglycerides and reduces fat accumulation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Maintain a healthy weight: Losing even a small amount of weight can significantly reduce liver fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps your liver flush out toxins more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Limit alcohol consumption: While NAFLD is on the rise, alcohol remains a significant risk factor for liver damage. Moderate your intake to give your liver a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Manage stress and sleep: Incorporate stress-management techniques like meditation and yoga into your routine, and aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Get regular check-ups: Routine health screenings, including liver function tests, are essential for early detection, especially for individuals with risk factors like obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a remarkably resilient organ, capable of regeneration and healing. However, it needs our support. By making mindful choices every day, we can protect our liver from the growing threat of lifestyle-related diseases and secure a healthier future for ourselves and our nation. It's time to pay back the organ that works tirelessly to keep us healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
