Most of these tests are still in early development.

These would set the underpinnings of the heart-age test. (Most of the metrics used in the calculator are standard, but some are more specialized, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;eGFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;which tests kidney function.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGKRYN5NIBG4RHFYXQSBAF37NQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then, since they were interested in the state of heart health in America, they checked the heart ages of more than 14,000 men and women enrolled in the government’s huge and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C6JZ6TEOYBFLRPH7SCX5R3ZVZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even many people in their 30s had relatively old hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do about an aging heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XMMD6OE5BHKJASNNMBS5Q3QLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What does it mean if the calculator says your heart is older than you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SOF3KIGAGVHSTEOZNQJZI2XFJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“First, it’s important to have context,” Khan said. “A year’s difference from your chronological age is probably not meaningful. But if people’s hearts are more than five years or 10 years away from their chronological age, it’s worth paying attention to what’s going on and what might be driving that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDAXGDM435HQLE3SM5HQETFEGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Talk to your doctor if your heart age is at least five years older than your calendar age, she said. The calculator might be indicating you’d benefit from more vigilance. “We know that half of people with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/17/blood-pressure-diet-salt-alcohol/" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; aren’t being treated,” she said, “and most people who qualify for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/22/statins-cholesterol-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;statin therapy&lt;/a&gt; aren’t on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OTRKDVZVSNGG7LDFCEFBQT3AIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The interventions needn’t all be medical. “Lifestyle changes, especially &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/27/walking-cadence-aging-health-improvement/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; and diet, are also important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XPPZDTTKYBBY7AYVZD22NDDGAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even people whose heart ages equal or prove younger than their actual age can benefit from that knowledge, she said. “One of the most challenging things is to maintain &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/21/longevity-exercise-resistance-training/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.” So, as the years pass or you enter health transitions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/02/menopause-brain-changes/" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, the calculator might be able to help you track how well your heart continues to age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="C3UUINT72FFDTN66WJRQGAYRI4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="C3UUINT72FFDTN66WJRQGAYRI4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What the calculator leaves out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLTWLKXLXRGU3CH3G4UHACU63E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The heart-age calculator has limits, though. “It’s a way to communicate risk that will resonate with some people,” said Martha Gulati, the director of preventive cardiology and associate director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai Health Sciences University in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7ERNWZ6VJC7FKLWKNLBJCOYKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But its equations don’t include certain cardiovascular risk factors specific to women, she said, such as menopausal changes and pregnancy complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C4NXJQ3ZUNGZXALMTSBODH4XIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They also don’t include estimations of aerobic fitness or exercise habits, which can be key to heart health, said Ulrik Wisloff, the head of the cardiac exercise research group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway, who’s studied exercise and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/18/sitting-rising-test-longevity/" target="_blank"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; for decades. “I still find it puzzling why physical activity and peak oxygen uptake have yet to be incorporated into the original Framingham risk model, despite strong evidence” for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881567/" target="_blank"&gt;their predictive power&lt;/a&gt;, he said. His group has developed its own free, online &lt;a href="https://fitnessage.miahealth.no/en" target="_blank"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, based on exercise and endurance, that estimates your fitness age in comparison with your chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NEELNEIZNGS7IYOOM5OTWBO4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The key point about all of these biological-age calculators, whether they focus on fitness or organs, such as hearts, is that they can serve as a wake-up call, Gulati said. If the numbers indicate your heart might be aging too rapidly, that’s a message that you probably need to be paying some more attention to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OJT443WZGJAVJJEQYW34NUDABE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I do think” the heart-age calculator “is a bit gimmicky,” Gulati said. “But if it helps to motivate a patient to make changes, I’m here for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

Although the possible connection is still being untangled, study co-author and audiologist &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/nicholas-s-reed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nicholas Reed&lt;/a&gt; advises prioritizing hearing health regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are already more than enough established benefits related to hearing care,” says Reed, a faculty member of the NYU Langone &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Optimal Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/series/the-joys-of-aging","type":"Series","title":"The joys of ageing"},{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/ageing","type":"Keyword","title":"Ageing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/sarah-sloat","type":"Contributor","title":"Sarah Sloat"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What’s especially important about supporting hearing health is the effect it has on keeping people engaged in the world, Reed explains.

We lose our hearing at different frequencies at different rates, which can make sounds garbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4dea5699-6992-4b84-88a5-d2ad1826eaab" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I thought I was a bad listener.

Other conditions can seem more pressing, and hearing loss becomes a low priority. There can be “downstream effects” in a healthcare context because hearing loss can hinder patient-provider communication, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-relationship-between-hearing-loss-and-dementia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the relationship between hearing loss and dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Early research suggests that hearing loss is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3869227/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21320988/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an increased risk of new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, although further studies are needed to understand this connection. Researchers have not, however, found a cause-and-effect relationship between hearing loss and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Reed and his colleagues wanted to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2832869" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calculate the number of cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; there could be in a population if a potential risk factor, in this case hearing loss, was eliminated. They used a sample of nearly 3,000 adults aged 66 to 90 and found 32% of the dementia risk in the sample group was potentially associated with audiometric hearing loss (hearing loss measured through testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the authors, these results suggest that treating hearing loss may delay the onset of dementia in some older adults. However, this research cannot establish whether hearing loss causes dementia, explains co-author Jason Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One potential reason hearing loss is associated with cognitive changes is that it can lead to more social isolation, which may strain the brain and affect memory, says Reed. Another theory is that because auditory signals stimulate the brain, the lack of stimulation caused by hearing loss can lead to accelerated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9649369/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain atrophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If hearing problems are linked to an increased risk of dementia, are there ways to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/1/afaf004/7965371?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduce that risk?&lt;/a&gt; An influential 2020 Lancet &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; recommended the use of hearing aids and protecting ears from excessive noise exposure.

For example, we can manage conditions associated with hearing loss, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-021-00789-w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/diabetes-complications/diabetes-and-hearing-loss.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. We can also limit exposure to sources of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020481" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;damaging noise&lt;/a&gt;, like construction equipment, lawn mowers, motorcycles and loud music.

Establishing a baseline can help you identify changes over time, and indicate if and when new habits might be useful. The longer you live with impaired hearing, the harder it is to adjust to tools like hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-possible-to-reverse-hearing-loss" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it possible to reverse hearing loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several treatments and devices can help alleviate hearing loss, but their effectiveness depends on the individual. If you suspect you have hearing issues, it’s best to have your hearing checked and discuss options with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing aids can be purchased &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/hearing-aids-and-personal-sound-amplification-products-what-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; or with a prescription. Reed says learning how to wear them takes &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-adjust-to-hearing-aids/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;time and practice&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a critical public health need to &lt;a href="https://mostpolicyinitiative.org/science-note/hearing-aids-and-medicaid/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expand coverage&lt;/a&gt; for these tools, says Smith, because it’s well-established that hearing aids can improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While studies haven’t proven that hearing aids will delay dementia, scientists are intrigued by their potential to support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea is that, in theory, if a person uses hearing aids, communication becomes easier and you lower the burden of cognitive load,” says Reed. “You’re stimulating the brain with more auditory signals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Staying engaged in social networks is key to maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, says Reed. In a 2025 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2833601" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Reed and colleagues found that, among people with hearing loss, participants who received hearing aids and were counseled on their use experienced less loneliness and social isolation. They also had more varied types of connections, such as friends, family and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, assistive &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/assistive-devices-people-hearing-voice-speech-or-language-disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; may help. These range widely in function and design, but generally amplify sound, reduce background noise, and improve communication. For example, &lt;a href="https://mn.gov/deaf-hard-of-hearing/assistive-technology/apps/#:~:text=Some%20examples%20of%20speech%2Dto%2Dtext%20apps:%20*%20Ava,(iOS%2C%20Android%2C%20Windows)%20*%20Otter.ai%20(iOS%2C%20Android)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; that convert speech to text can assist with phone calls, and personal amplifiers can enhance hearing in conversations. People with mild to moderate hearing loss may find some relief in settings like crowded restaurants through items like the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/26/apple-airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids-use-australia-tga" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feature a built-in hearing aid&lt;/a&gt;, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some instances, what can help a person manage hearing loss best is how they are supported by their community. There’s a need for more equitable environments that support people with sensory health needs, says Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some communication tips can go really far,” says Reed. “Good communication is looking someone in the face. It’s speaking slowly. It’s about rephrasing and adding context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQV0lJVHk2VVc1YUY1eF9qSndQZEhHRUVBSFJabENjUnoxT1BMWC1POHlTa2lqamlyRnhWN096dHB4OW1kWk5LOHppdGVOQ2FXMndMQjhfNEt5a29tVTVRak1xNW5LQ285clQtVTl5X3NJaV9oRGdVX0ROZDlKbUxIRjlnYlhTNnFEMGI0Z0pkb05sYjVreW93aDFaUzFNUQ</guid></item><item><title>隐藏在非常常见的咖啡机中的致癌化学物质应“不惜一切代价避免” -每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your at-home coffee machine may be pushing you toward a cancer-related death, doctors say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are warning against using coffee makers made of black plastic over fears the material contains high levels of cancer-causing chemicals and flame retardants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kitchen utensils, electronics and coffee machines are made of recycled plastic that is melted together from different colored items, which gives it a messy and unappealing color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, manufacturers commonly &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13916453/study-color-kitchen-utensils-cancer-causing-chemicals.html"&gt;add a dye known as carbon black &lt;/a&gt;to the recycled products to turn them into a consistent black color to look sleeker and uniform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that carbon black contains numerous compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), that are carcinogenic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the International Agency for Research on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-06665140-6d52-11f0-a65b-29defdbea910"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; classified carbon black as a carcinogen in 2020, despite limited evidence on its effects on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To ensure that their now-black plastic products are immune to electrical fires, they also add in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) during production &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 Chemosphere &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653524022173?via%3Dihub"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;has also found that exposure to items containing high levels of BFRs and OPFRs can increase the risk of cancer, cause neurotoxicity and hormone disruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts are warning against using coffee makers made of black plastic over fears of containing high levels of cancer-causing chemicals and flame retardants. (Stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Megan Liu, study co-author and science and policy manager at Toxic-Free Future, said: 'Companies continue to use toxic flame retardants in plastic electronics, and that's resulting in unexpected and unnecessary toxic exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These cancer-causing chemicals shouldn’t be used to begin with, but with recycling, they are entering our environment and our homes in more ways than one. The high levels we found are concerning.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that if your black plastic coffee maker is damaged or is consistently exposed to boiling water for long periods of time, the cancerous chemicals may start melting during the coffee-making process and slowly trickle down into your coffee cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once they enter the body, these chemicals act as endocrine disruptors, interfering with the body's hormonal system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes damage to cells and could lead to mutations that may become cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no risk with occasional or rare exposure to carbon black, BFRs and OPFRs, all three of these carcinogens can accumulate in the body and cause damage to vital organs such as the thyroid, breasts, lung and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 Environmental Pollution &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749122005073#:~:text=Inflammatory%20cytokines%2C%20especially%20CRP%2C%20were,black%20exposure%20on%20pulmonary%20carcinogenesis."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that long-term carbon black exposure might damage lung cell DNA, cause inflammation and pave the way for lung cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 Duke University study also noted that due to excessive exposure to BFRs and OPFRs through kitchen products such as coffee machines, doctors are now finding these&lt;span&gt; chemicals in the blood, breast milk and &lt;/span&gt;urine in nearly all of the Americans they tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If your black plastic coffee maker is constantly exposed to boiling water, the cancerous chemicals may start melting and slowly trickle down into your coffee cup.

&lt;p&gt;A universal cancer vaccine in development could help rev up the immune system against tumors and supercharge the effects of existing cancer therapies, an animal study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to vaccines for viral infections like the flu, many &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/what-are-cancer-vaccines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/what-are-cancer-vaccines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are designed to help the immune system recognize specific proteins. However, while conventional vaccines aim to prevent disease, cancer vaccines are currently being developed to clear away cancers already growing in the body and to help prevent treated cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, conventional vaccines and cancer vaccines often work similarly. The flu shot trains the immune system to look for unique proteins found on the surface of influenza viruses, while cancer vaccines typically teach immune cells to spot unique features of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a challenge: These cancer proteins of interest can often be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4194257219349349576&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41392-022-01270-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-01270-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41392-022-01270-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unique to individual patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning each cancer vaccine may need to be specially formulated for each patient. Although it's possible to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/melanoma-vaccine-small-trial.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/melanoma-vaccine-small-trial.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;craft such personalized vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they take time to make — and, in the interim, the patient's cancer mutates, potentially causing the vaccine to be less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be months from the time you get a patient's specimen to when they actually have a personalized therapy," said study senior author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/elias-sayour" target="_blank" data-url="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/elias-sayour" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Elias Sayour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric oncologist at University of Florida Health. Sayour and colleagues wondered if they could design a cancer vaccine that would not require this personalization and instead ignite a general immune response to keep cancer at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that something could be available immediately, albeit in a nonspecific way … could be revolutionary for how we bridge therapy and how we manage patients," Sayour told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/new-mrna-vaccine-treats-deadly-brain-cancer-and-it-triggers-a-strong-immune-response" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/new-mrna-vaccine-treats-deadly-brain-cancer-and-it-triggers-a-strong-immune-response"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New mRNA vaccine for deadly brain cancer triggers a strong immune response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="an-off-the-shelf-cancer-vaccine-3"&gt;An "off-the-shelf" cancer vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental vaccine, described in a report published July 18 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6697330705195526217&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41551-025-01380-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01380-1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41551-025-01380-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is built upon messenger RNA (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/what-are-mrna-vaccines-and-how-do-they-work" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/what-are-mrna-vaccines-and-how-do-they-work"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mRNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which also formed the basis of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that continue to be updated now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA acts as blueprints that cells then base new proteins on. In the COVID-19 vaccines, the molecule contains instructions for a bit of the coronavirus; in the new cancer vaccine, it carries instructions for a substance that raises the body's first-line immune defenses, poking the "innate" immune system rather than the "adaptive.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the vaccine aims to boost the body's production of type-I interferons — immune messengers that play important roles in controlling inflammation and spotting cancerous tumors in order to eliminate them. In a series of experiments in lab mice, the researchers demonstrated that this signaling is key to snuffing out tumors early in their development. The signals help rally the immune system to attack the tumors and hinder the cancer's growth, and if you block them, tumor growth goes haywire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these experiments showed that this early interferon activity is vital to a common form of cancer treatment, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These treatments rip the breaks off of immune cells so they maintain a high level of activity and kill off cancer efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer has ways of hijacking interferon signals and thus thwarting the anti-cancer immune response that follows — so the cancer vaccine acts as a kind of immune "reset," Sayour explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the vaccine in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in a mouse model of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. In mice with treatment-resistant tumors, the combo of treatments worked better than checkpoint inhibitors alone, the team found. They also tested the vaccine on its own in mouse models of other cancers, including glioma (a brain cancer) and pulmonary osteosarcoma (bone cancer that's spread to the lungs). It showed promising anti-cancer effects when applied by itself, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this early work, the team tested a few different mRNA formulations to stir up the interferon response and found that each did so effectively. More work is needed to understand if the mRNA molecules themselves or the proteins they're used to make are more important for triggering this generalized response, Sayour noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study focused on solid tumors, which tend to be more resistant to immunotherapy than blood cancers are, Sayour said. But "I personally think this can be used for all forms of cancer," he added. "I believe this is a universal paradigm that can be used to treat cancer." In particular, he could see it being applied as secondary prevention, to help stop treated cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This exciting and novel paper shows promising evidence that giving the immune system a short, targeted boost at just the right time can help previously unresponsive tumors respond to immunotherapy," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/profiles/azzam-diana.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/profiles/azzam-diana.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diana Azzam&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor and scientific director at the Center for Advancing Personalized Cancer Treatments at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach could be especially helpful for 'cold' tumors — types of cancer that usually don't trigger a strong immune response, like pancreatic, ovarian, and some types of breast cancer," Azzam, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. These tumors hide from the immune system and can be difficult to target with immunotherapy, so it's possible that this type of vaccine could help expose these cancers to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed to confirm how well this approach will work in people, the encouraging results in mice offer a strong foundation," Azzam said. In people, you'd want to ensure that the vaccine mounts a helpful immune response without sparking unwanted inflammation in the long run, for instance. "Future studies will address key questions around safety, consistency, and long-term effectiveness in real-world cancer patients," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sayour and his colleagues have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched a human trial testing a two-hit approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine followed by a personalized one. They're working with patients with two types of recurrent cancers: either pediatric high-grade glioma or osteosarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach saves valuable time needed for personalized vaccinations and may induce rapid immunity that can be further seized upon by personalized therapy," Sayour said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC-t0oHUELy1hHlkzQWE9iHpLfgzlgCbueR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC-t0oHUELy1hHlkzQWE9iHpLfgzlgCbueR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading U.S. authority on the science of ultra-processed foods made headlines this spring when he accused the Trump administration of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/well/kevin-hall-nutrition-retirement-nih-censorship-rfk-maha.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;censoring his work&lt;/a&gt; and opted to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/nih-kevin-hall-ultraprocessed-foods-nutrition-censorship/"&gt;retire from his position&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institutes of Health. Without interference from D.C. to worry about, and with a forthcoming book, “Food Intelligence,” to promote, Hall is ready to speak candidly about his experiences with the leaders of the Make America Healthy Again movement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That includes going into detail about why the plan for Hall’s return to NIH — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/nih-kevin-hall-ultraprocessed-foods-nutrition-censorship/"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; by the agency’s director Jay Bhattacharya — fell apart, and what Hall sees as top health officials’ ongoing failure to pursue scientific answers about exactly how ultra-processed foods are hurting Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;

	For all the miraculous effects attributed to GLP-1s like Ozempic — from craving suppression to fighting inflammation — Hollywood’s favorite drugs do not defy the law of gravity. As they’ve grown in popularity and availability, so has the need for treatments that target that drooping skin that follows rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Surgeons like New York-based Macrene Alexiades have made a specialty of it. “I have successfully treated and reversed GLP-1 sagginess in my patients with radiofrequency treatments for skin laxity reduction, combined with PRP plus artful strategic filler placement to restore key areas of atrophy,” Alexiades tells &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;. “Usually two treatment sessions, a month apart, is enough to achieve a full correction and restoration.”

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Dermatologist Simon Ourian, meanwhile, focuses “on restoring collagen and muscle mass, which are often depleted during rapid weight loss.” He says, “We use our proprietary [hyaluronic acid-based] Neustem regenerative protocol to rebuild structural support, enhance muscle tone, and restore vitality to the face and body without the risk of overfilling. For the body, we combine regenerative solutions with energy-based skin tightening and contouring to address loose skin and improve definition in areas like the abdomen, arms and thighs.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Paul Jarrod Frank recommends second-generation scarless skin removal — a technique known as Ellacor fractional micro-coring — to treat crepey skin on the face, neck, arms, abdomen, legs and back. “Unlike microneedling, which punches holes in the skin and delivers heat, Ellacor punches holes and literally cores out just under a millimeter of skin, done thousands of times over each area to remove a significant percentage with each treatment,” the dermatologist explains. “The advantage is that you are removing, lifting and tightening skin without having to do a more aggressive surgical intervention. Holes close in 24 hours, with full recovery in five days.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Beverly Hills dermatologist Rhonda Rand (Angelina Jolie is a longtime client) leans into a combo of facial fillers, plus “radiofrequency microneedling to help tighten the skin and high-intensity focused ultrasound to stimulate collagen at deeper levels.” She tells &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;, “In severe cases of facial wasting, even a facelift would be appropriate. When the skin is sagging so much, noninvasive procedures may not be enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	GLP-1s have also ushered in a new wave of skin care products. Chicago-based plastic surgeon Julius Few (who has collaborated with Gwyneth Paltrow for Goop) recently added a $300 topical DermaReverse serum to his product line “designed specifically for GLP-1 users experiencing GLP Face” as well as a $195 Skin Tightening + SPF 30 with Dermatight to target sagging and laxity on the body. Image Skincare, which has a strong Hollywood following, has introduced $134 Vol.U.Lift, developed by the company’s plastic surgeon co-founder to address volume loss, sagging and other side effects of GLP-1 usage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Launching a whole new industry? Add it to that list of miraculous effects.&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted to explore the relationship between the human skin microbiome and psychological well-being, and they found a potential correlation. Turns out, skin care can not just improve the health of your skin and how it functions — it may also influence one’s mood and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study uncovered that specific classifications of bacteria may have an impact on one’s well-being, with an emphasis on cutibacterium, an acne-causing bacterium.

This will allow you to start from the ground up while restoring your skin’s barrier. “But remember that your microbiome didn’t just become compromised overnight,” she adds, “so it will take time to repair, but repair it will.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:40:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNaGVqRXJ6SFpCNHA3VTN2bkVCeHhYR3QxVUdYQVA0MmFZMUpPWGVTb09WNEh0dWZzSzJUX25fc0swMnVkLWlxNmJQaHRFdnpXRHdsbm9EellmQ1Bsb3JObXVZaGNYUXpsOFRaZ3FERFRJUEh2bTJMMkxyczFKenN2Z1BHb3ZKMHVlYXMya1V6SWtCWXVkTzdn0gGcAUFVX3lxTE5sUURYMVFJNjF6UlI1am4yTUxFVzVUWGpILWN2UkpMdmFvNnVERFNWWTItWlVxN3dsLTJ3WDlQenFGcDZ6czJkRjVLMXlpZ25jRE9OLXpfNUZEVzJKM3JfeWtCX0RESXByYXdrUGR4bXpIVEFLcDNFWlo5cFgtODV4Nk9YM3k2UC1DczdqTUhCTXZMeVRrZ1dDZWhRUA</guid></item><item><title>2500年前青铜罐中的粘稠粘液终于被发现，解决了70年的争论- Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQaUc3bVZoUWN5TGJpbDFyQUwwSi1Gc1poalBnT0s4OU1oako3ZEtSTVlOSjE5Vm85YWRsNVVQcUt5M0thVEhqbm4zOUtVWEwxUjF1RWJOMDlCLVJZcVpFZ3hHaE05NGQxYy13aVc5bU5BT1EwbW96LXAtSElWSDk3ZHRvYlVnSGQzTXM4eW1zYUV2VGRkejFqS21WYVpyeHA4NVdWRFdhNGZ1WTBqajJXcGs3WGxqeUx3Z1ItZTdhNE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globs of sticky goo discovered in the bottom of 2,500-year-old bronze jars from southern Italy have been chemically identified, settling a 70-year archaeological debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's honey — the sweet leftovers of an offering to an ancient god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of chemists and archaeologists used cutting-edge analysis techniques to test the paste-like residue. They concluded that the jars, which were found in the sixth-century-B.C. city of Paestum, originally contained honeycomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I find interesting is that the ancient Greeks did think that honey was a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34693-superfoods.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34693-superfoods.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;superfood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-3121" target="_blank" data-url="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-3121" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Luciana da Costa Carvalho&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a chemist at the University of Oxford, said in a video.

Despite at least four attempts over seven decades to confirm the presence of the sticky, sweet substance, no evidence of sugars was ever found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/does-honey-ever-go-bad" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/does-honey-ever-go-bad"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does honey ever go bad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Carvalho and colleagues decided to take advantage of recent advances in chemical analysis techniques and to reopen the question of the gooey substance's origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f5R4rZR2grXmAzNkWfJUDT" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f5R4rZR2grXmAzNkWfJUDT slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mass spectrometry, a technique that can identify different molecules and compounds, Carvalho and colleagues identified intact hexose sugars in the ancient jar residue for the first time. Fresh honey is about 79% hexose sugars, the researchers wrote in the study, with fructose being the most abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the proteins in the ancient sample revealed the presence of royal jelly, a milky secretion &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey"&gt;&lt;u&gt;made by worker bees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers also recovered peptides — short amino acid chains that are smaller versions of proteins — unique to one species of honeybee: the European honeybee (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bees-wasps/where-do-honey-bees-come-from-new-study-turns-the-standard-picture-on-its-head" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bees-wasps/where-do-honey-bees-come-from-new-study-turns-the-standard-picture-on-its-head"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Jars with sticky goo were discovered in the 1950s inside this underground shrine at Paestum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Alamy)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding up these analyses, the researchers wrote that the study presents the first direct molecular evidence supporting the presence of honey, likely offered as honeycombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The amount of sugar in the ancient residue is very low compared to modern honey," Carvalho told Live Science in an email. "I think the residue tastes like washed honeycomb but slightly more acidic," Carvalho said, although she did not actually try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified copper ions in the honey mixture. Because these ions are biocidal, meaning they can kill microorganisms, "their presence would have contributed to the preservations of sugars on the surface of the residue," Carvalho said, potentially explaining how the honey lasted thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the goop can help archaeologists better understand ancient rituals and shrines. The jars were found in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Poseidonia,+Underground+Shrine&amp;amp;object=building" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Poseidonia,+Underground+Shrine&amp;amp;object=building" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underground shrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also called a heroon, at Paestum. The heroon also included a large, wooden table with wool-wrapped iron rods placed on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offering may have been made to Is of Helice, the mythical founder of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/sybaris" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/sybaris" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ancient Greek city of Sybaris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, located in what today is the arch of Italy's boot. When Sybaris was destroyed in the sixth century B.C., its inhabitants fled and founded a city called Poseidonia. But when the Romans took it over in the third century B.C., they renamed the city Paestum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study shows that "there is merit in reanalyzing museum collections because analytical techniques continue to develop," Carvalho said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

The guidance will appear at the end of the summer, before the winter respiratory season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Five other scientific groups – the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians – also plan to release vaccine guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The news comes amid growing changes to how vaccines are recommended by US officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy and other officials have also announced new restrictions on Covid vaccines, and Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;framed&lt;/a&gt; vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella shot as a “personal” choice during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worst US measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A new endeavor, the Vaccine Integrity Project, is now conducting a wide-ranging review of scientific studies on vaccines, due to wrap up in the next two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The volunteer-driven vaccine project is analyzing 16,400 publications on flu, Covid and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientific groups will then draw upon that review to issue guidance for the populations they serve, including children, high-risk people, pregnant people and healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not making recommendations ourselves. We’re just providing them with the information,” said Michael Osterholm, the epidemiologist heading the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research &amp;amp; Policy (Cidrap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is an effort to take up the work done by the CDC’s independent advisory group, the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), since 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For the past five-plus decades, we have looked at the CDC as the authoritative source for guidance and information related to vaccines,” said Scott Rivkees, associate dean for education in the Brown University School of Public Health and former surgeon general of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, “the medical community very much disagrees with” the current approach from health agencies, he said, and it is quickly pivoting from relying on CDC recommendations to collaborating on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Americans are facing an “information crisis” as official guidance falters, Osterholm said. “The CDC science has been corrupted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changing official health guidance “results in total confusion”, Rivkees said. “Who do you listen to? It really puts parents and families in an incredibly difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Parents “have more questions now than before. We see more vaccine hesitancy than before. We see more vaccine refusal than before,” Rivkees continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These changes that are happening now are the result of politics, not related to science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Organizations like the Vaccine Integrity Project and its collaboration with medical groups will be vital to “preserve what we know works” when it comes to protecting people from infectious diseases and other health issues, said Rivkees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientific groups already have expertise – and trust – in these areas, he said. Working together will help them make evidence-based, trustworthy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines during pregnancy, despite strong and consistent evidence that the vaccines are safe in pregnancy and that pregnancy is a major risk factor for severe illness and death from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Immunization is especially important during pregnancy, when the risks of severe outcomes are heightened – and when vaccines can provide critical protection to the infant after birth,” Sandra E Brooks, CEO of ACOG, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC also changed the pediatric Covid recommendation from “should” to “may” and FDA officials put greater restrictions on who may receive Covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet Covid remains a major threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This year, the number of hospitalizations, serious illnesses and deaths in kids from Covid exceeded that of influenza, and this was one of the worst influenza years in a decade,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Flu and RSV also pose major risks, and without recommendations from the CDC for annual boosters, those vaccines and preventives could face an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The respiratory vaccine guidance is only the beginning, Osterholm said. “This was just the first effort, because it was the most immediate need right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After this, the organization will focus on data for other routine vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The thought that we now have to care for more children with measles, more children with whooping cough than before, is really very unfortunate,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m very afraid that this country is moving to a situation where some elements within our nation are going to accept children dying of measles, children dying of whooping cough, teenagers dying of meningitis, not getting vaccinated as the new normal. And the thought that we are going to now be able to think that this is acceptable is frankly terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Outside guidance will help parents and providers navigate the evidence on vaccines, Rivkees said – and it may help insurers decide which vaccines to cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover vaccines recommended by ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“As ACIP makes changes to recommendations, then the question comes, are these vaccines going to continue to be covered or not? Whereas before insurance may pay for certain vaccines, maybe they won’t in the future, which means families will have to pay out of pocket,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Decreases in vaccination could mean manufacturers make fewer vaccines or pull out of the market entirely. “The other thing that we’re also very worried about is what’s going to happen to the vaccine supply,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vaccines help insurers save money by preventing illness, Osterholm said. “But they’ve got to have a basis for making the decision that ‘we will support this,’ and that’s what we’re trying to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outside recommendations are meant as a stopgap measure, Osterholm says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We need our old ACIP back. We need to have the kind of scientific expertise, based on the expertise in the community, to ensure the vaccine enterprise is healthy and exists,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not, as the Vaccine Integrity Project, hoping that we exist for very long. We’d love to see us go away because of the return of ACIP and CDC leadership,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, he said, “we know that that’s not going to happen, at least for the next few years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNUWFvMWdPSlJ5OUM5QW8zZUdYVXRiTmgtRk5taUk1S09sV1lxem9SeDNvTkJ4VTNObm5rYzVTc2JKN0kyRGdoNzdPTENxT01ORTctQk9tQm5Gd3IxdEFJblpsQ1A2Q3EyUU4zMFhNdnBISGVzOWhqSWx3OHNuUGszMFZYOGE1ZnVQaWc</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，联邦食品援助计划可能会减缓认知能力下降- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPSG1TNTJidFE2NHplWUU5U1J3eDRHNWdQZllFb3FmVHRCak9DVlZ0cThndnBPZUo1cnhjZ2FySld6eWs4UmdwSHJUbFFhMGRsbnM2Mk9mRkJxOHBFLWtaeTFqZk12eVBpMGZCSzV6azQxS051d1A3UHk5d25Gc3ZQMktubXM0UjkySkgybXJZckU0SWE5UlRqTFJJdzlvV0pmWnpYVHduQVRkSXVXdHk0ZkZoaDU4NDY3NXljWThYYTVLZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE5VWDI4b1F2UHZ4a1EtdjFCYXp2Zjg0Y01DWWhpazRLbjQ0MFRUM1k4ZHBpT3NqWGFZNEY1RmRzdzVwUV9zVEo4MXBoOVhZRDkyQXI5U1V3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46773b" class="body-graf"&gt;Older adults who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had a slower rate of cognitive decline than people who were eligible for the anti-hunger program but didn’t receive benefits, according to a study presented Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4b62e" class="body-graf"&gt;Although many adults begin to mentally slow down in midlife, researchers found that people over 50 who participated in SNAP, which helps people with low incomes afford groceries, had a 10% slower rate of decline in their memory and thinking skills compared with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe4f1e" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s equal to gaining two to three additional years of cognitive health over 10 years, said Linlin Da, lead author of the study, who presented her findings Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36d11d" class="body-graf"&gt;By providing a secure source of food, SNAP “may have some underappreciated benefits for brain health,” said Da, who led the study while she was a doctoral student at the University of Georgia College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d60358" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health-funded study comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed legislation that the Congressional Budget Office estimates &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-snap-for-millions-of-families.html" target="_blank"&gt;will cut funding&lt;/a&gt; for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, by $186 billion through 2034. Food banks across the United States are already &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/25/06/04/dc-food-banks-usda-cuts/" target="_blank"&gt;struggling to meet growing demand&lt;/a&gt; amid funding cuts from the Agriculture Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4a270" class="body-graf"&gt;Food insecurity “can lead to poor nutrition and chronic disease, and all of that can negatively impact the brain,” Da said. “So by improving access to nutrient-rich foods, SNAP may support brain health, reduce the stress and promote better health overall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1bd71" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study, which hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, leaves many questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e4da" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers didn’t measure which foods study participants consumed, so they don’t know if people receiving SNAP benefits had healthier diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f81a7c" class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors know that high-sodium diets can raise blood pressure, one of the most important risk factors for dementia, said Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer for brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b701a5" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also doesn’t explain how food security might benefit the brain, said Elkind, who wasn’t involved with the research. It’s possible that programs such as SNAP relieve the anxiety that people feel when they can’t afford their groceries or when they have to choose between paying for food or medication, giving them more mental bandwidth to focus on other issues. Chronic stress &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43884-3" target="_blank"&gt;has been linked to a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3953b" class="body-graf"&gt;The design of the new study, which followed more than 2,300 older people for 10 years, can’t definitively prove that participating in SNAP protects brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-430308" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s possible that people who participated in SNAP were cognitively healthier before the study began, Da said. Enrolling in SNAP can be time-consuming and complicated, making it more difficult for people with cognitive problems to complete their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2946ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Yet a growing field of research &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622132578" target="_blank"&gt;links nutrition, food security and dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc811a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Observational studies from around the world have shown us that food insecurity and poor cognitive health go together,” said Kriti Jain, a health administrator at the National Institute on Aging, part of the NIH, who wasn’t involved in the study. “More recent studies have shown us that food insecurity comes before cognitive health gets worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a9eb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Brain health is shaped by far more than genetics, Da said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1cea94" class="body-graf"&gt;Cognitive aging “can also be shaped by policies, by the environment and by access to different resources,” she said. “That means we can do something to change it and improve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c5a30" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-hunger-advocates-slam-house-republicans-proposed-cut-snap-rcna206484" target="_blank"&gt;Anti-hunger groups contend&lt;/a&gt;

She reapplied for the program during the pandemic when her pet sitting customers stopped needing her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-133507" class="body-graf"&gt;Forbes, who lives outside Portland, Oregon, said SNAP has been especially important since she developed long Covid in 2022, which has left her with heavy fatigue, prevents her from working and has caused “brain fog” that resembles age-related cognitive decline. Forbes said she and her father, who is 82, “are going through a sort of Alzheimer’s thing together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9738f5" class="body-graf"&gt;Although Forbes said she used to talk “a million miles a minute,” she now often struggles to find the right word. If she tries to speak too quickly, “everything comes out jumbled and stupid.” After an 18-month wait, Forbes said she recently began receiving disability benefits from Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0c839" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of SNAP, Forbes said, she doesn’t have to choose between buying groceries and paying her rent or electric bills. Her favorite part of SNAP is being able to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, she said. Oregon’s SNAP program &lt;a href="https://doubleuporegon.org/markets/" target="_blank"&gt;provides “double benefits” for shopping&lt;/a&gt; at farmers markets, so people can buy twice as much fresh produce for the same amount of money. Forbes said she tries to follow a healthy diet in the hope of overcoming her illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1bf99c" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you’re chronically ill, every little tiny thing you can do to improve your health makes all the difference in the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3e8f44" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food insecurity linked to dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b724e5" class="body-graf"&gt;Jain described food insecurity as “a severe and growing public health issue in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa94f1" class="body-graf"&gt;In families with member over age 60, the prevalence of food insecurity &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/families-older-adults-have-less-access-nutritious-safe-food" target="_blank"&gt;has almost doubled&lt;/a&gt; in the past two decades. Twenty-three percent of such families faced chronic or recurring food insecurity from 2015 to 2019, according to a survey from the NIH &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38427343/" target="_blank"&gt;published last year in JAMA Health Forum&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26aaad" class="body-graf"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-abstract/79/11/gbae153/7750664?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=true" target="_blank"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; found that food insecurity doubled the risk of probable cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f5289" class="body-graf"&gt;And a paper published in 2024 in the Journal of Nutrition found that adults with food insecurity and lower-quality diets &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623728319" target="_blank"&gt;had significantly steeper declines in cognitive scores&lt;/a&gt; during the study, conducted from 2012 to 2020. In that study, however, participating in SNAP wasn’t related to the rate of mental decline, suggesting that SNAP alone “may be insufficient to prevent negative cognitive effects of poor diet and limited access to nutritious foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-382c2b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprecedented cutbacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff18fb" class="body-graf"&gt;The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on social and economic policy, &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-senate-budget-reconciliation-snap-proposals-will-affect-families-every-us" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that funding cuts could lead 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their food benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37416c" class="body-graf"&gt;The 20% decrease in funding is “the largest cut to SNAP in history,” &lt;a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20bill%20puts,need%20to%20grow%20and%20thrive." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan think tank.

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;We now live in the &lt;strong&gt;Pyrocene&lt;/strong&gt;, a proposed new &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale"&gt;geologic epoch&lt;/a&gt; of high wildfire activity brought about by human-caused climate change. The occurrence of extreme fire weather is now roughly double compared to the preindustrial period, according to a study released just this week. The Pyrocene has brought a long summer of wildfire smoke in 2025 across North America, where plumes have disrupted outdoor plans for millions of residents. The worst smoke is blowing from the intense fires burning in central Canada, which has already experienced its third-worst fire season on record. But fire activity in the Western U.S. is beginning to ramp up as well, with major wildfires in Arizona and in Utah creating increasing amounts of unhealthy smoke in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoke problems will likely intensify across the continent through August and probably well into September. The next major smoke episode to affect the Upper Midwest is now underway, with the smoke poised to move deep into the central U.S. by this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in the Pyrocene means a new reality: knowing what the latest wildfire smoke forecasts are, in order to plan your outdoor activities. We review below the best tools to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wildfire smoke forecasts are often inaccurate &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that forecasting wildfire smoke is HARD, and model forecasts are often way off – either high or low. The models to forecast smoke are in their infancy, and not only do forecasters have to get the meteorology right, they also have to get fire behavior and atmospheric chemistry right – including how the smoke interacts with clouds and rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point: You would think that a heavy rainstorm would clean the air of smoke – and it often does – but at my house in southeast Michigan in June, pollution from the main health-damaging component of wildfire smoke, PM 2.5, increased to the red “Unhealthy” level during a six-hour rain storm that dumped over a half-inch of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/silent-calamity-the-health-impacts-of-wildfire-smoke/"&gt;Silent calamity: The health impacts of wildfire smoke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This counterintuitive event occurred when the circulation associated with the rain storm pulled down particles from an elevated plume of smoke overhead. Worse, the models didn’t know that the elevated plume was there and did not properly forecast the increase in my Air Quality Index, or AQI. When the models finally did show an extensive band of “Unhealthy” air, the forecast for the placement of the band was displaced by several hundred miles.&lt;/p&gt;

Predicted surface PM 2.5 levels seven hours into the future from NOAA’s AQM v7 model (left) vs. observed PM 2.5 (right) valid at 9 a.m. EDT June 5, 2025. A band of red “Unhealthy” air was predicted to extend from southern Wisconsin to the northeast over northern Lower Michigan, but the band actually occurred several hundred miles to the southeast.

&lt;p&gt;Satellites are good at telling us how much total smoke is present in a column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, but not at the concentrations of smoke at various elevations, which you typically need to make a good smoke forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the satellites used by some models pass over a specific area only once a day. As a result, if a fire starts after the satellites pass over or if the fire significantly changes size after the satellite passes, that information will not be in the forecast until the following day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, smoke forecasts are often way off, particularly beyond one day. This is particularly so if new fires start or if established fires diminish because of firefighting efforts or precipitation. Smoke models typically do not allow for fires to spread horizontally, and they have to make assumptions about how high the smoke plume will rise, what type of vegetation is burning, what chemical reactions will affect the smoke, and other hard-to-quantify factors. A &lt;a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2024-107/gmd-2024-107.pdf"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; documenting NOAA’s AQMv7 model said it this way: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;the AQMv7 demonstrates large bias/error for PM2.5 near and downstream of wildfire sources in the western U.S., indicating uncertainties in fire emissions, transport, and plume chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to use smoke model forecasts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use multiple models to understand your wildfire smoke risk, and check the initial smoke concentrations the models are using at the beginning of their runs to see if they match the actual concentrations. Put more trust in models that get the initial conditions right! (But even if a smoke forecast does not get the absolute levels of PM 2.5 right, it can be useful to see trends.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look particularly closely where major fires are burning. Sometimes the models do not know where fires are burning because of cloud cover, or they assume that there is a major source of smoke where fires may have suddenly died down. I’ve seen errors in the assumed starting concentrations of smoke of over a factor of 10, for both underestimates and overestimates. Errors are more likely to occur when dense cloud cover is over major fires, preventing accurate satellite estimates of fire intensity and initial smoke concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that PM 2.5 particles are also emitted by many other human sources, such as cars, power plants, and industrial activity. It is good to know the total PM 2.5 levels from all sources, not just wildfire smoke. During a wildfire smoke episode on a hot summer day with light winds, PM 2.5 from smoke often will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be the dominant source of total PM 2.5, particularly in cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to check your current air quality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend these sources of current PM 2.5 data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPA’s &lt;a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/#4.45/43.56/-86.69"&gt;Fire and Smoke Map&lt;/a&gt;, which includes data from official EPA monitors and four kinds of low-cost backyard sensors, most notably from purpleair.com&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://map.purpleair.com/1/mAQI/a10/p604800/cC0#3.92/41.56/-83.28"&gt;Purpleair.com&lt;/a&gt;, a company that has a huge global network of low-cost backyard PM2.5 sensors. I’ve had one in my backyard for over 10 years and have been very pleased with it (the cost is $239-$299). Note that these inexpensive devices are known to read about 10-40% too high during episodes of intense wildfire smoke, depending upon the levels of smoke, according to a 2024 study. The purpleair.com site allows you to apply the appropriate correction factor: At the upper left of the map, click on the text, “US EPA PM2.5 AQI,” then choose the “Apply Conversion” option, then select “US EPA.” The purpleair.com site also allows you to display current PM 2.5 levels as AQI or concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter, with the latter option being handy to compare to what smoke models are predicting.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html#maps"&gt;NOAA Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Product&lt;/a&gt; has an interactive map of smoke plumes and fire locations. There is also a twice-per-day &lt;a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/spl/includes/fire/current_text.html"&gt;text analysis of the smoke situation&lt;/a&gt;, plus areas where blowing dust is occurring, based on satellite analyses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-map"&gt;IQAir&lt;/a&gt; has a nice global map of current PM 2.5, including a fancy &lt;a href="https://www.iqair.com/earth?nav="&gt;3D map on a rotatable sphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;For Canada and Alaska, &lt;a href="https://aqmap.ca/aqmap/en/#4/58.55/-107.24/B31/L38/L40/L41"&gt;aqmap.ca&lt;/a&gt; has a map with PM 2.5 observations from official monitors and four types of backyard sensors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPA human-generated forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the gold standard for knowing how smoke will impact air quality is information at EPA’s &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/national-maps/"&gt;AirNow.gov&lt;/a&gt;. It provides a graphical air quality forecast for today and tomorrow and offers links for text-based air quality forecasts from the state air quality department, where available. These will specifically discuss wildfire smoke when it is expected to reduce air quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-quality smoke forecasts available, combining model data with expert human interpretation. The forecasts are also available on the excellent (and free) AirNow app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Forecasts only go out one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment Canada human-generated forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/airquality_menu_e.html"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; has three-day text-based forecasts of its &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/about.html"&gt;Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the impact of wildfire smoke. Environment Canada’s &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/"&gt;Interactive Weather Alerts map&lt;/a&gt; shows where Air Quality Warnings and Air Quality Statements are in effect. Clicking on the appropriate location will bring up text with the smoke forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-quality Canadian smoke forecasts available, combining model data with expert human interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer model wildfire smoke forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer models to predict surface wildfire smoke concentrations are run by multiple agencies in the U.S. and Canada. These models are relatively new — the first operational smoke model, HRRR-Smoke, came online in 2020. Improvements are coming at a rapid pace. The output from the models for the main health-damaging component of wildfire smoke, PM 2.5, is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter, so you will have to know the conversion factor to get the Air Quality Index (AQI). In the U.S., the EPA standard for 24-hour PM 2.5 levels is 35 micrograms per cubic meter, which corresponds to an AQI of 100 (orange, “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups”). The threshold for the red “Unhealthy” range is 55.4 micrograms per cubic meter, which corresponds to an AQI of 150. You can use EPA’s &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/"&gt;AQI Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to do these conversions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the U.S. 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter is set higher than it should be, according to many recent scientific studies: Breathing PM 2.5 has increasingly been found to cause more severe health problems than previously realized. The Canadian 24-hour PM 2.5 standard is 27 micrograms per cubic meter, and the international World Meteorological Organization standard is just 15 micrograms per cubic meter, equivalent to an AQI of 62 on the U.S. scale. I develop a cough if I breathe outside air for more than a few minutes when the PM 2.5 AQI from wildfire smoke reaches about 60 – close to the WMO standard, and I believe that the EPA boundary for an AQI of 100 – the beginning of the orange “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” range – should be at the WMO standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I give an overview of seven computer model forecasts of wildfire smoke and/or total PM 2.5. It is important to realize that your health is affected by total PM 2.5 – the combination of small particles from wildfire smoke plus other sources, such as car exhaust, power plants, and factory emissions. Many smoke models (like NOAA’s flagship HRRR-Smoke model) only give PM 2.5 levels from wildfire smoke, which will underestimate the total health burden of all of the PM 2.5 in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

Surface PM 2.5 forecast from the 12 UTC (8 a.m. EDT) Thursday, July 29 run of &lt;a href="https://airquality.weather.gov/?element=apm25h01_bc&amp;amp;mapcenter=-96.00%2C40.00&amp;amp;mapzoom=5&amp;amp;subregion=CONUS&amp;amp;region=CONUS"&gt;NOAA’s Air Quality Model (AQM v7)&lt;/a&gt;, valid at 8 a.m. EDT Thursday, July 31. PM 2.5 levels in excess of an AQI of 100 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, orange color) is predicted for portions of Minnesota and North Dakota. Two large wildfires in the Western U.S. are predicted to bring “Unhealthy” (red) levels of smoke to portions of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. air quality model I like the most for predicting wildfire smoke is &lt;a href="https://airquality.weather.gov/?element=apm25h01_bc&amp;amp;mapcenter=-96.00%2C40.00&amp;amp;mapzoom=5&amp;amp;subregion=CONUS&amp;amp;region=CONUS"&gt;NOAA’s Air Quality Model (AQM v7)&lt;/a&gt;, which became operational in 2024. It provides hourly pollution forecasts for North America going out three days. From the “Air Quality Elements” drop-down menu, select “Bias-Corrected PM2.5,” which will display PM 2.5 forecasts from all sources, including wildfire smoke. There are options to plot hourly, 24-hour average, or maximum daily PM 2.5. The numbers shown on the images are in micrograms per cubic meter, but the colors are contoured with colors corresponding to the AQI scale (green, yellow, orange, red, purple, and brown) so that you don’t have to mentally convert from micrograms per cubic meter to AQI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows levels of total surface PM2.5, not just from smoke (emissions from cars, factories, etc. are often the dominant source of PM2.5); output shows both micrograms per cubic meter and AQI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower resolution (13 km); runs only twice per day (midnight and noon UTC, which is 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. EDT); data doesn’t arrive until about seven hours after initialization time.&lt;/p&gt;

Surface smoke forecast from the 18 UTC (2 p.m. EDT) Thursday, July 29 run of NOAA’s HRRR-Smoke model, valid at 8 a.m. EDT Thursday, July 31. PM 2.5 levels in excess of an AQI of 100 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) from smoke only is predicted for Minnesota. Two larges wildfires in the Western U.S. are predicted to bring “Unhealthy” (red) levels of smoke to Arizona and Utah. Note that total PM 2.5 levels are not shown here, and will be much higher, because of additional pollution from cars, heavy industry, power plants, etc. The legend at the bottom has been modified to show AQI info. (Image credit: &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/Welcome.cgi"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other U.S. model I like to use is &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/"&gt;HRRR-Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, the top operational U.S. model for forecasting wildfire smoke. The meteorology is done by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, which also provides 48-hour weather forecasts nationwide with a fine grid resolution of three kilometers. HRRR-Smoke makes 18-hour smoke forecasts every hour and 48-hour smoke forecasts every six hours (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 GMT) for the U.S. (there is a separate version of the model for Alaska, &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRR-AKsmoke/"&gt;HRRR-AK Smoke&lt;/a&gt;). The most useful option to predict air quality is “near-surface smoke.” There are also options to look at the smoke 1,000 feet high, 6,000 feet high, and through the whole depth of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-resolution computer smoke model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes PM 2.5 only from smoke, not from human emissions or blowing dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPsmoke/"&gt;RAP-Smoke&lt;/a&gt; is a coarser resolution (13 km) U.S. model useful for predicting smoke transport on a regional level. Forecasts go out 21 hours and are generated every hour. The model runs considerably faster than HRRR-Smoke, so data is available several hours sooner. The &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/HRRR-Smoke_VIIRS_Activefire_user_guide.pdf"&gt;RAP- and HRRR-Smoke User’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; has details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I like the most for long-range smoke forecasts for North America is &lt;a href="https://fluid.nccs.nasa.gov/wxmaps/chem2d/?stream=G5FPFC&amp;amp;field=pm25sfc&amp;amp;level=0&amp;amp;region=nam"&gt;NASA’s GEOS-FP model&lt;/a&gt; (Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing). The early run (0 UTC or 8 p.m. EDT) goes out a full 10 days, the longest of any smoke/PM 2.5 model. The late run (12 UTC or 8 a.m. EDT) makes five-day forecasts. Keep in mind that forecasts more than a few days in advance will be highly inaccurate! This is particularly so if new fires start or if established fires diminish because of firefighting efforts or precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Global; forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); only model to make ultra long-range PM 2.5 forecasts (10 days)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution (about 25 km); data not available until about 11 hours after the initialization time; grids are continental-scale, making it hard to see local detail; inaccuracy: I’ve seen the model incorrectly initialize smoke levels, resulting in a PM 2.5 forecast five times too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/charts/packages/cams/products/particulate-matter-forecasts?base_time=202506060000&amp;amp;layer_name=composition_pm2p5&amp;amp;projection=classical_north_america&amp;amp;valid_time=202506060300"&gt;CAMS&lt;/a&gt; (the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring System) provides five-day global forecasts of PM 2.5 that include wildfire smoke. There is a 10-km higher-&lt;a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/charts/packages/cams_air_quality/products/europe-air-quality-forecast-regulated?base_time=202506060000&amp;amp;layer_name=composition_europe_pm2p5_forecast_surface&amp;amp;level=key_0&amp;amp;originating_centre=85_2&amp;amp;projection=opencharts_europe&amp;amp;valid_time=202506060000"&gt;resolution version of the model for Europe&lt;/a&gt; (and in France, the &lt;a href="https://www.prevair.org/"&gt;PREVAIR model&lt;/a&gt; offers five-day PM 2.5 forecasts for that nation). &lt;a href="https://www.windy.com/-Menu/menu?cams,pm2p5,42.377,-82.915,5"&gt;Windy.com&lt;/a&gt; has a nice interface on its website (and on the free version of its app) to display the CAMS data on its animated map with wind streamlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Global; forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); one of only two long-range PM 2.5 forecast models (five days).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution (about 40 km), and the grids it runs on are large, so it’s hard to see local detail; runs only once per day (at 0Z); the minimum concentration of the contours is set too high (20 micrograms per cubic meter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://silam.fmi.fi/aqforecast.html"&gt;SILAM model from the Finnish Meteorological Institute&lt;/a&gt; has a seven-day global PM 2.5 forecast with a grid available for the CONUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS: &lt;/strong&gt;Long-range, seven-day forecasts available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution; can’t save the URL for the CONUS grid in a bookmark, so you must navigate from the default European map to get the CONUS map.&lt;/p&gt;

Environment Canada surface PM 2.5 forecast from the 12 UTC (8 a.m. EDT) Thursday, July 29 model run, valid at 8 a.m. EDT Thursday, July 31. PM 2.5 levels in excess of an AQI of 100 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) is predicted for much of the Upper Midwest, as well as multiple Canadian provinces. Note that I modified the legend at the side to show AQI info, and the colors used in the map do not correspond to the standard AQI colors used by the U.S. EPA. For example, light green on this map corresponds to an AQI of 100, which is color-coded orange (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) in the U.S. EPA system.(Image credit: &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=12"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canadian wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the top-five smoke models I like is Environment Canada’s &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/"&gt;three-day air quality forecast&lt;/a&gt; for North America from its Air Quality Model of surface PM 2.5, updated twice daily at &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=00"&gt;0 UTC&lt;/a&gt; (which updates around 1 a.m. EDT) and &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=12"&gt;12 UTC&lt;/a&gt; (which updates around 1 p.m. EDT). Imagery for total PM 2.5 from all sources, and just from smoke, is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); provides three-day forecasts; has zoom-in maps for Canadian provinces; decent grid resolution (10 km).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Does not initialize smoke concentrations well in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://firesmoke.ca/"&gt;FireSmoke Canada&lt;/a&gt; (AKA The BlueSky Canada Smoke Forecasting System) produces a two-day surface smoke forecast that shows the locations of current major wildfires. There are options to see the hourly, daily average, and daily maximum smoke levels. It’s produced by the Weather Forecast Research Team at the University of British Columbia. It has an &lt;a href="https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/BSC00WC04-01/current/"&gt;experimental forecast for Western Canada&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows boundaries of active fires; decent grid resolution of 12 kilometers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Accuracy – I’ve seen the model improperly initialize smoke conditions, giving PM 2.5 levels over 10 times too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental U.S. wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RRFS-SD/"&gt;RRFS-SmokeDust&lt;/a&gt; (the Rapid Refresh Forecasting System Smoke and Dust model) is NOAA’s next-generation, soon-to-be-operational weather-smoke forecasting model. RRFS-SmokeDust makes 18-hour smoke forecasts every hour and 3.5-day smoke forecasts every six hours (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 GMT) for the U.S. The three-kilometer high-resolution model has improved physics, data assimilation, and handling of meteorology compared to HRRR-Smoke. It’s slower to run than HRRR-Smoke and has only one large domain covering North America. It includes PM 2.5 from both smoke and dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPchem/"&gt;RAP-Chem&lt;/a&gt; is an even fancier experimental model that does two-day forecasts of a number of air pollutants, including PM2.5, NOx, CO, and ozone. It forecasts not just smoke but all PM2.5, including the background levels of pollution from cars and power plants. The model runs once per day, at 6 UTC (2 a.m. EDT), and is rather slow to run: The 24-hour forecast point is typically available after 10 hours (around noon EDT), and the 48-hour forecast point comes in around 3 p.m. EDT. Data is not always available since it is experimental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/#status"&gt;U.S. Forest Service BlueSky modeling system&lt;/a&gt; is a suite of tools that allows you to combine a number of weather models, air pollution models, fire models, and smoke transport models. The tools are particularly valuable for showing high-resolution forecasts of wildfire smoke in the Western U.S. The EPA’s Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) model is the main tool used to make the PM 2.5 forecasts. The U.S. Forest Service also has a portal, &lt;a href="https://portal.airfire.org/"&gt;Wildland Fire/Air Quality Tools&lt;/a&gt;, which has BlueSky and other useful air quality info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Pacific Northwest smoke model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://airpact.wsu.edu/map.html?v=0.003"&gt;AIRPACT&lt;/a&gt; is a high-resolution (4 km) air pollution model, which includes wildfire smoke, providing three-day PM 2.5 forecasts for the U.S. Pacific Northwest. It forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution) and has the option to display PM 2.5 as AQI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps for forecasting wildfire smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 100 air quality apps for smartphones that provide PM 2.5 forecasts, and it is beyond the scope of this post to present a review of them. The most popular apps — like Plume Labs (integrated into AccuWeather) and AirVisual from IQAir — do not offer forecasts from any of the smoke models listed above, like HRRR-Smoke, CAMS, or FireWork. There are, however, at least three apps that may be more valuable, because they do offer wildfire smoke forecasts from some of the advanced smoke models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Google Weather App&lt;/strong&gt; (built-in on many Android/Pixel phones) includes PM 2.5 forecasts with smoke model data sourced from BreezoMeter. (Note that the built-in weather app on iPhones offers only current AQI from BreezoMeter, not an AQI forecast.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaia GPS&lt;/strong&gt; (free 14-day trial) includes a “Smoke Forecast” overlay in the map layers that uses &lt;strong&gt;HRRR-Smoke&lt;/strong&gt; model output. It offers real-time (current), 24-hour, and 48-hour smoke forecast maps at three-kilometer resolution across the continental U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windy.com/"&gt;Windy.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a dedicated &lt;strong&gt;surface PM 2.5&lt;/strong&gt; forecast layer powered by the European CAMS model. The free version of the app offers four-day PM 2.5 forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

And if that’s happening night after night for years, it adds up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Early diagnosis, therefore, is critical—but it’s currently falling short. Diagnosis frequently relies on a partner noticing loud snoring, an unreliable signal at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The reality is, women—and especially pregnant women—have been overlooked when it comes to sleep disorders,” says Brown. “Right now, our diagnostic standards for sleep apnea are based on a very narrow demographic—typically middle-aged men. But we know that women present differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What’s classified as ‘mild’ apnea in a man could be moderate or even severe in a woman, particularly during pregnancy,” she adds. “We’ve supported research in pregnant women that found even mild sleep-disordered breathing was an independent risk factor for maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Wearable tech companies are racing to fill the diagnostic gap. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch recently became the first wearable to receive De Novo authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for detecting signs of OSA. But experts remain cautious. “Wearables and home sleep tests are improving, but they’re not yet a replacement for a full clinical diagnosis,” says Malhotra. “They can give a false sense of security—people see a score and think they’re fine when they’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Mander is also skeptical: “They’re not accurate enough to replace proper diagnosis,” he says. “They might be better than nothing—as long as you treat them as one piece of information, not the full picture.” While smartwatches and rings can track metrics like heart rate variability, they’re still not reliable at detecting breathing patterns, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The gold standard in diagnosis is polysomnography, a clinical sleep study that monitors brain waves, oxygen, heart rate, and muscle activity. But this is expensive and time-consuming, and doesn't scale well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;New home-based devices are now offering better options. Mander highlights WatchPAT, which uses finger, wrist, and chest sensors to detect apnea events by analyzing changes in blood vessels. There’s also ARES, a wearable headband monitor that measures airflow, oxygen levels, and sleep position, and NightOwl, a fingertip device that received FDA approval in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It's a big step forward, especially for reaching underserved populations who might not be able to access a sleep lab,” Mander says. Still, there are limitations. “Right now, the home test doesn’t know if you’re awake or asleep, much less the sleep stage. It would probably miss people with REM-dominant OSA,” he says. “If we have devices that can detect when these events are happening—in REM versus non-REM—that could help us pick up people earlier and reduce their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Once diagnosed, CPAP—continuous positive airway pressure—remains the gold standard for treatment, despite being uncomfortable or claustrophobic for some users. It uses a small machine to deliver a steady stream of air through a mask, keeping the airway open during sleep. “CPAP improves symptoms, blood pressure, and we now have emerging evidence that it may reduce cardiovascular risk,” says Malhotra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For those who can’t tolerate CPAP, new tools such as nasal inserts are emerging on the market. Some interventions are more unconventional—and yet surprisingly effective. “There’s an Australian study that showed learning the didgeridoo helped strengthen throat muscles and reduce OSA severity,” says Mander. “It’s a fun example, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ultimately, the most critical step is awareness. “We used to think snoring was just annoying or funny,” Malhotra says. “Now we understand that it can be a sign of a serious medical condition. If you snore heavily or feel constantly tired, don’t just brush it off—go see your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5sRndaUE5ZejRsMzdoZEFHY3g3ejJ0eWFoYWNrSGc3MjBTUGI2T0VBU0ZHQWk5MTg1U1ZXbUUxdUlEUlZfOU5IWG0yd2xZVjFTVFdoejM0M0RqZ1ZIbzJsdkFkV25FQXpQZXc2ZG1lSzRoczdr</guid></item><item><title>蚊子叮咬！让自己对它们不那么有吸引力的5个技巧- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9idGVsdHY1ZE1WRzJKNERFYmdGLWVWaHNXd1Nrd3VFb0Rfc0hGZUlrbzQ3WW81YmpsY19Xc1ZHSlFWWjZFaU8tRldVXzV3clNNdmRrMm1BdFB5TVg1NVdHeTBtOXZDeW9uaGxoZzN4am9YX2d6eFFhRjNrWlpock0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;For summertime beachgoers, the threat of sharks may loom large, but nature’s deadliest predator is actually much smaller.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000q3b6my2gh1l5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tiny mosquito is not only a warm-weather nuisance but also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wears the crown for “No. 1 killer of humanity across our existence,” according to historian Dr. Timothy C. Winegard. The predatory insect takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128123652000032#bb0010" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1 million lives&lt;/a&gt; each year by transmitting lethal diseases. Sharks, meanwhile, are &lt;a href="https://www.ifaw.org/journal/faq-about-sharks#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20do%20sharks,each%20year%20by%20shark%20attacks." target="_blank"&gt;estimated to have a kill streak&lt;/a&gt; orders of magnitude smaller, at fewer than 10 people per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000r3b6mnhw1z513@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Where humans go, mosquitoes have followed. Their itchy bites and the disease-causing pathogens they carry are infamous, and the insects are also responsible for driving many of humanity’s most essential turning points throughout history, said Winegard, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/1524743429/" target="_blank"&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000s3b6mm65bd4ms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; and yellow fever (have shaped) our historical journey from our hominid ancestral evolution … right to present day,” Winegard told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000t3b6mgw88ryqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard, an associate professor of history at Colorado Mesa University, got the initial idea for his best-selling book from his dad’s interest in malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000u3b6mjgt62ptl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wee pest didn’t intrigue Winegard too much at first. “I kind of disparaged him and said, ‘Sure, dad, I’ll write a book on mosquitoes,’” he recalled. But once Winegard began going down the rabbit hole of mosquito-borne pathogens’ impact on humanity — including, but not limited to malaria, Zika   virus, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile virus — he couldn’t stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000v3b6mualqn6bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito’s impact on history is still deeply felt in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt; people die of malaria alone each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/malaria-drug-babies-africa-intl"&gt;disease-heavy regions&lt;/a&gt; have suffered financially as a result. “Northern Hemisphere countries don’t have endemic malaria, (so) they’re able to develop more affluent economies because they’re not continuously suffering from malaria,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000w3b6mabla7tyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can listen to the full episode &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/c5RbATve" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmdoxax4d00023b6m9esn16as@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000y3b6mdk03hdst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans have been battling mosquitoes for millennia, and amid the season’s summer peak in the Northern Hemisphere, Winegard offered some insight into how you can keep them away this summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000z3b6mpchtue5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eighty-five percent of what makes you alluring or less alluring to mosquitoes is prewired in your genetic circuit board,” according to Winegard. However, there are a few ways you can manage mosquitoes. He has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800113b6m9joi46cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Booze makes it easier for mosquitoes to see you, Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800123b6m9hkrd3eh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes hunt by sight, but they don’t see the world like people do. The predatory insects employ thermal, or infrared, vision. “They see heat signatures,” Winegard noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800133b6mxcfsqcmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consuming alcohol raises your body temperature,” he explained over email, “which make(s) you an identifiable heat signature for your soon-to-be tormentor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800143b6mfbihlute@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, maybe reach for a refreshing glass of water or lemonade instead of that beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800163b6mzucz63n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to using heat-based vision, mosquitoes hunt down humans primarily through smell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800173b6mjtwpp6sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard said mosquitoes “can smell carbon dioxide from over 200 feet (60 meters) away.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800183b6mktk221ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you’re exercising or breathing heavily, they’ll smell that and be attracted to it,” Winegard told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800193b6mu70yo1g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just like alcohol, high CO2 emissions make detecting heat signatures easier for mosquitoes, so Winegard recommends keeping yourself as cool as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001a3b6msyx2estk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This applies to your wardrobe, too. “Dark clothes retain relatively more heat,” he said, so it’s best to opt for lighter-colored, long-sleeved attire to keep mosquitoes at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001c3b6m930dnw0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Applying insect repellent is the gold standard for mosquito management, but if you’re not careful when applying it, you can leave yourself vulnerable to bites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001d3b6mu0ucva0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know people who lather themselves in it, but they miss this little spot on the back of their calf and she’ll find the chink in our armor,” Winegard told Gupta, referring to the female mosquito, who is the bloodsucking hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001e3b6mdz4y0hvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquito repellent isn’t like perfume, in which a few spritzes can cover your whole body. If you’re spraying, make sure to be thorough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001f3b6ma8spo557@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “DEET (a chemical repellent) is still the gold standard, while oil of lemon eucalyptus is a plant-derived option,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001g3b6mgh9hynqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For an added boost of security, he noted some clothes come pretreated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/about-permethrin-treated-clothing-and-gear.html#:~:text=clothing%20and%20gear-,Permethrin%20is%20an%20insecticide%20that%20kills%20or%20repels%20mosquitoes.,will%20help%20prevent%20mosquito%20bites." target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-targeted insecticide called permethrin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001i3b6mf9tlgwbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pool days and cool drinks outdoors offer a respite from the heat for humans, but they are equally as attractive to mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in still water — and they don’t need much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001j3b6mh38ewur3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From a pond or stream to a minuscule collection in the bottom of an old container, used tire, or backyard toy — even a bottle cap full  — any will suffice,” Winegard said via email. Even waterlogged soil is enough for mom-to-be mosquitoes to lay their eggs in, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001k3b6muz2nunei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard recommended eliminating standing water around your home and yard to keep potential mosquito breeding grounds to a minimum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001m3b6mpuz3hmwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another way to fight the swarms this summer is to consider skipping a shower or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001n3b6m4rmsgp3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s better to be stinky!” Winegard said. “Being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001o3b6mrefqgjor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this may offend others, Winegard says to skip the scented products: Deodorants, soaps and other applied fragrances are all enticing to mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001p3b6m6m93jbap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The one exception is your feet. “Clean your feet,” he told Gupta. “The bacteria on our feet, which is the same one that ripens a lot of cheeses, is an aphrodisiac to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001q3b6mric5kpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard noted that this is the reason many of us get bitten around our ankles and feet. “So, wash your feet!” he urged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001s3b6mif6clfzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes don’t care about most personal characteristics you can objectively see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001t3b6man1zppc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blondes and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001u3b6m2nxjyrlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he noted that “she does play favorites and feasts on some more than others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001v3b6my4n7focq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might entice a mosquito? “Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B or their blend,” he said. “People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001w3b6mflzzazk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The creators of the 1998 movie “A Bug’s Life,” he noted, must have “done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a ‘Bloody Mary, O-positive.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001x3b6m04z1fqg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it’s a mosquito’s world, Winegard suggests, and people are just living in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;For summertime beachgoers, the threat of sharks may loom large, but nature’s deadliest predator is actually much smaller.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000q3b6my2gh1l5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tiny mosquito is not only a warm-weather nuisance but also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wears the crown for “No. 1 killer of humanity across our existence,” according to historian Dr. Timothy C. Winegard. The predatory insect takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128123652000032#bb0010" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1 million lives&lt;/a&gt; each year by transmitting lethal diseases. Sharks, meanwhile, are &lt;a href="https://www.ifaw.org/journal/faq-about-sharks#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20do%20sharks,each%20year%20by%20shark%20attacks." target="_blank"&gt;estimated to have a kill streak&lt;/a&gt; orders of magnitude smaller, at fewer than 10 people per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000r3b6mnhw1z513@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Where humans go, mosquitoes have followed. Their itchy bites and the disease-causing pathogens they carry are infamous, and the insects are also responsible for driving many of humanity’s most essential turning points throughout history, said Winegard, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/1524743429/" target="_blank"&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000s3b6mm65bd4ms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; and yellow fever (have shaped) our historical journey from our hominid ancestral evolution … right to present day,” Winegard told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000t3b6mgw88ryqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard, an associate professor of history at Colorado Mesa University, got the initial idea for his best-selling book from his dad’s interest in malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000u3b6mjgt62ptl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wee pest didn’t intrigue Winegard too much at first. “I kind of disparaged him and said, ‘Sure, dad, I’ll write a book on mosquitoes,’” he recalled. But once Winegard began going down the rabbit hole of mosquito-borne pathogens’ impact on humanity — including, but not limited to malaria, Zika   virus, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile virus — he couldn’t stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000v3b6mualqn6bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito’s impact on history is still deeply felt in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt; people die of malaria alone each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/malaria-drug-babies-africa-intl"&gt;disease-heavy regions&lt;/a&gt; have suffered financially as a result. “Northern Hemisphere countries don’t have endemic malaria, (so) they’re able to develop more affluent economies because they’re not continuously suffering from malaria,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000w3b6mabla7tyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000y3b6mdk03hdst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans have been battling mosquitoes for millennia, and amid the season’s summer peak in the Northern Hemisphere, Winegard offered some insight into how you can keep them away this summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000z3b6mpchtue5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eighty-five percent of what makes you alluring or less alluring to mosquitoes is prewired in your genetic circuit board,” according to Winegard. However, there are a few ways you can manage mosquitoes. He has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800113b6m9joi46cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Booze makes it easier for mosquitoes to see you, Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800123b6m9hkrd3eh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes hunt by sight, but they don’t see the world like people do. The predatory insects employ thermal, or infrared, vision. “They see heat signatures,” Winegard noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800133b6mxcfsqcmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consuming alcohol raises your body temperature,” he explained over email, “which make(s) you an identifiable heat signature for your soon-to-be tormentor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800143b6mfbihlute@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, maybe reach for a refreshing glass of water or lemonade instead of that beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800163b6mzucz63n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to using heat-based vision, mosquitoes hunt down humans primarily through smell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800173b6mjtwpp6sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard said mosquitoes “can smell carbon dioxide from over 200 feet (60 meters) away.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800183b6mktk221ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you’re exercising or breathing heavily, they’ll smell that and be attracted to it,” Winegard told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800193b6mu70yo1g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just like alcohol, high CO2 emissions make detecting heat signatures easier for mosquitoes, so Winegard recommends keeping yourself as cool as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001a3b6msyx2estk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This applies to your wardrobe, too. “Dark clothes retain relatively more heat,” he said, so it’s best to opt for lighter-colored, long-sleeved attire to keep mosquitoes at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001c3b6m930dnw0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Applying insect repellent is the gold standard for mosquito management, but if you’re not careful when applying it, you can leave yourself vulnerable to bites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001d3b6mu0ucva0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know people who lather themselves in it, but they miss this little spot on the back of their calf and she’ll find the chink in our armor,” Winegard told Gupta, referring to the female mosquito, who is the bloodsucking hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001e3b6mdz4y0hvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquito repellent isn’t like perfume, in which a few spritzes can cover your whole body. If you’re spraying, make sure to be thorough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001f3b6ma8spo557@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “DEET (a chemical repellent) is still the gold standard, while oil of lemon eucalyptus is a plant-derived option,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001g3b6mgh9hynqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For an added boost of security, he noted some clothes come pretreated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/about-permethrin-treated-clothing-and-gear.html#:~:text=clothing%20and%20gear-,Permethrin%20is%20an%20insecticide%20that%20kills%20or%20repels%20mosquitoes.,will%20help%20prevent%20mosquito%20bites." target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-targeted insecticide called permethrin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001i3b6mf9tlgwbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pool days and cool drinks outdoors offer a respite from the heat for humans, but they are equally as attractive to mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in still water — and they don’t need much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001j3b6mh38ewur3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From a pond or stream to a minuscule collection in the bottom of an old container, used tire, or backyard toy — even a bottle cap full  — any will suffice,” Winegard said via email. Even waterlogged soil is enough for mom-to-be mosquitoes to lay their eggs in, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001k3b6muz2nunei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard recommended eliminating standing water around your home and yard to keep potential mosquito breeding grounds to a minimum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001m3b6mpuz3hmwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another way to fight the swarms this summer is to consider skipping a shower or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001n3b6m4rmsgp3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s better to be stinky!” Winegard said. “Being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001o3b6mrefqgjor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this may offend others, Winegard says to skip the scented products: Deodorants, soaps and other applied fragrances are all enticing to mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001p3b6m6m93jbap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The one exception is your feet. “Clean your feet,” he told Gupta. “The bacteria on our feet, which is the same one that ripens a lot of cheeses, is an aphrodisiac to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001q3b6mric5kpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard noted that this is the reason many of us get bitten around our ankles and feet. “So, wash your feet!” he urged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001s3b6mif6clfzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes don’t care about most personal characteristics you can objectively see.

            “There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blondes and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But he noted that “she does play favorites and feasts on some more than others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What might entice a mosquito? “Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B or their blend,” he said. “People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The creators of the 1998 movie “A Bug’s Life,” he noted, must have “done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a ‘Bloody Mary, O-positive.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Maybe it’s a mosquito’s world, Winegard suggests, and people are just living in it.

&lt;p&gt;Body fat percentage and body fat mass aren’t the same thing, so if your goal is to lose fat and look more sculpted or defined, you’ll need to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I’ve spent years helping clients build muscle and strength while losing fat — it’s a process called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-you-lose-fat-and-build-muscle-at-the-same-time-heres-the-scoop-on-body-recomposition" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-you-lose-fat-and-build-muscle-at-the-same-time-heres-the-scoop-on-body-recomposition"&gt;body recomposition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a bit like the Holy Grail of fitness goals. But when it comes to the fat loss part, I’m surprised by how many people aren’t aware of their body fat percentage and their mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently caught up with some experts who shared their insight into fat mass and fat percentage, the difference and why &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; matter if your goal is to hone your physique.

This percentage is often used as a measure of overall body composition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-the-difference"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's the difference?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-5grDWpRFDhmcJqcwVQxXYE-guP70jYGdaj6y19WdrsvYFfTQy7TkJak" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-5grDWpRFDhmcJqcwVQxXYE-guP70jYGdaj6y19WdrsvYFfTQy7TkJak slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator"&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;p class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Daniel Herman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="person__role"&gt;SAQ coach and NASM PT and nutritionist &lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Herman is a SAQ coach and NASM-qualified personal trainer and nutritionist with 28 years’ experience in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheema says that while body fat mass refers to the actual &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; of fat in your body, body fat percentage represents &lt;em&gt;how much &lt;/em&gt;of your total weight is fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, someone who weighs 180 pounds and has 15% body fat has a lower fat percentage than someone who weighs 180 pounds with 30% body fat, even though both individuals have the same body fat mass,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=tomsguide_us_1555238858843435878&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bio-synergy.uk&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fbody-fat-percentage-vs-body-fat-mass-experts-say-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-to-lose-fat" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" data-url="http://www.bio-synergy.uk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bio-synergy.uk&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fbody-fat-percentage-vs-body-fat-mass-experts-say-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-to-lose-fat" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="bio-synergy.uk" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Daniel Herman,&lt;/a&gt; NASM nutritionist and SAQ coach, adds that body fat mass is made up of essential fat needed for vital functions like hormone regulation and organ protection, and storage fat, which is an excess that your body keeps for energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains body fat percentage slightly differently: “If you weigh 80kg and have 20kg of fat, your body fat percentage is 25%. But if you gain 5kg of muscle while maintaining 20kg of fat, your percentage will decrease because the fat makes up a smaller proportion of your total weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body fat mass tells you how much fat you've lost. Body fat percentage shows whether you’re becoming leaner — even if your weight doesn’t change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="pros-of-reducing-body-fat-mass-3"&gt;Pros of reducing body fat mass&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reducing your overall body fat mass, you can improve various health markers, such as reducing the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheema says lower body fat mass can improve physical performance and lead to better muscle definition, increased strength and higher endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, there’s the day-to-day, which includes better mobility and reduced strain on your joints, which can improve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pros-of-reducing-body-fat-percentage-3"&gt;Pros of reducing body fat percentage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on reducing body fat percentage primarily improves body composition, resulting in a leaner, more toned appearance. In short, you build or maintain muscle mass while losing fat. Win-Win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can lead to improvements in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/hands-on/i-tested-the-levels-continuous-glucose-monitor-to-track-my-metabolism-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/hands-on/i-tested-the-levels-continuous-glucose-monitor-to-track-my-metabolism-heres-what-happened"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, better insulin sensitivity and a more aesthetic physique,” says Dr. Cheema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For athletes or individuals focused on strength training, reducing body fat percentage improves muscle-to-fat ratio, optimizing performance.” Because lean muscle is more metabolically active, you may find your resting metabolic rate also improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When lean muscle mass increases and fat comes down, this can have a positive impact on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/functional-strength-and-mobility-expert-shares-5-minute-routine-to-boost-flexibility-heres-why-im-sticking-with-it" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/functional-strength-and-mobility-expert-shares-5-minute-routine-to-boost-flexibility-heres-why-im-sticking-with-it"&gt;functional strength&lt;/a&gt; and bone health, not just energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important as you age and bone and muscle strength begin to decline. Plus, you should feel generally healthier and more able to carry out daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-which-is-better-to-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which is better to focus on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Cheema, it’s better to focus on reducing body fat percentage, “as this not only enhances physical appearance but also signifies improvements in muscle mass and overall fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, body fat mass is important, but Dr. Cheema says tracking body fat percentage is what gives a “clearer picture of your health and physical progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you need to reduce a number of kilos for medical reasons, this should be the priority to begin with. You can focus on the rest later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to reduce both, Dr. Cheema recommends combining cardio with strength training and a balanced diet. Think &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle"&gt;high protein&lt;/a&gt; and calorie-controlled (here’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-dont-recommend-counting-calories-heres-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-dont-recommend-counting-calories-heres-why"&gt;why I don’t recommend counting calories&lt;/a&gt;, but for a short time, sure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should help you reduce fat and build muscle at the same time, plus cardio exercises like running or cycling can help raise your heart rate, step count and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;. Getting about and completing more steps also improves energy burn outside of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your primary concern is health, focus on reducing body fat mass. If your goal is to look leaner or improve athletic performance, aim to reduce body fat percentage by maintaining or gaining muscle while losing fat,” recommends Herman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman agrees that there are a few steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition: &lt;/strong&gt;Eat in a caloric deficit to promote fat loss, prioritizing high amounts of protein, roughly 1.5-2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. Of course, balance is key, but during a deficit, it is better to steer clear of excessive sugar and alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength training: &lt;/strong&gt;Resistance training anywhere from two to five sessions per week, depending on your goals and lifestyle. Herman says to include &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-these-are-the-5-compound-exercises-i-taught-my-dad-to-build-strength-and-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-these-are-the-5-compound-exercises-i-taught-my-dad-to-build-strength-and-muscle"&gt;compound exercises&lt;/a&gt; like squats, deadlifts and push-ups, which I agree with wholeheartedly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio: &lt;/strong&gt;“Walking is underrated — daily steps matter,” says Herman. Moderate-intensity cardio or HIIT are great options, but if you don’t enjoy cardio, just focus on your steps. Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-study-reveals-the-real-number-of-minimum-daily-steps-you-should-take-according-to-your-age" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-study-reveals-the-real-number-of-minimum-daily-steps-you-should-take-according-to-your-age"&gt;real minimum number of steps you should take daily.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle:&lt;/strong&gt; Herman recommends between seven and nine hours of quality sleep. Stress can elevate cortisol levels and contribute to fat storage, so managing this and keeping energy high is important. Plus, always stay hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

						&lt;p&gt;Person County officials confirmed the sixth positive
rabies exposure case for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, officials with the Person County Animal
Services and Person County Health Department said a bat on Rolling Hills Road resulted
in two confirmed rabies exposures. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to take extra precautions when
approaching wild animals or animals they are unfamiliar with. Officials also
said people should: &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your surroundings when outdoors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep children and pets supervised and away from wildlife &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly friendly animals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Officials say anyone that may have been bitten or
scratched by an animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal should call 911
and seek emergency medical care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News has extensively &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/rabies/17483443/"&gt;covered rabies cases&lt;/a&gt; across North
Carolina. There is a full &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/what-to-do-if-you-see-an-animal-in-the-wild/20265048/"&gt;guide

As the study notes, “it remains unclear whether these brain aging effects may be at least partially reversible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert who wasn’t affiliated with the study, said its findings demonstrate “that even if you don’t get infected, all the repercussions of the pandemic — like social isolation and stress — can have an impact on brain health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that other things that we do have an impact on brain health, like exercise and diet and sleep,” Chin-Hong said. “So it makes sense that something as global and as profound as a pandemic would have an impact on brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those effects don’t necessarily include immediate decreased cognitive function, however. Although researchers documented accelerated aging in generally all the brain scans they studied, only those who contracted COVID-19 showed “small but measurable declines in cognitive performance — mainly in processing speed and mental flexibility,” according to Mohammadi-Nejad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that infection may introduce additional biological effects, such as inflammation or vascular issues, that are more directly linked to cognitive symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-21/covid-19-might-shrink-parts-brain-scientists-warn"&gt;have noted cognitive effects&lt;/a&gt; after COVID-19 illness, especially in severe cases, he said. But what’s new is that evidence of cognitive decline was found even in this study’s population “of generally healthy volunteers, most of whom had mild cases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows that even mild infection can leave subtle traces in the brain, although the effect size is relatively small,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was especially pronounced among older people, the study found, “suggesting a complex model of cognitive decline due to more pronounced accelerated brain aging from infection-related factors in older people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on an analysis of brain scans from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank,&lt;/a&gt; a large biomedical database in the United Kingdom that contains health information from volunteers taken both before and after the onset of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on a group of 996 participants and compared brain scans taken before and after the pandemic began. The group comprised primarily  middle-aged and older people, ranging in age from 47 to 79. Only those who were generally healthy were included in the study, meaning they didn’t have chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, dementia, kidney disease or major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this group, scientists found the accelerated brain aging was seen more strongly overall in older people and men. People who were socioeconomically disadvantaged — ranking lower on indicators such as income, education, employment and health access — also had more pronounced brain aging, Mohammadi-Nejad said, “likely due to increased exposure to pandemic-related stress &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-02/alarming-disparities-leave-parts-of-l-a-hard-bit-by-covid"&gt;and fewer resources to&lt;/a&gt; buffer its effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to suggest brain health was altered by the experience of living through the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403200121" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by scientists at the University of Washington, suggested that COVID-19 lockdown measures “resulted in unusually accelerated brain maturation in adolescents” and was greater in magnitude in females than males. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of that study noted that “females are at a higher risk for developing anxiety and mood disorders than males during typical adolescent development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But among adults, past research has suggested “men may be more susceptible to certain forms of brain aging,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. Other research, the study noted, has found “greater male susceptibility to cortical atrophy and neuroinflammation under stress, which aligns with our findings of heightened pandemic-related brain aging in males.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of limitations to the study. The people participating in the study who had COVID-19 had mostly mild cases — and they were generally healthier than the population overall, since those with chronic illnesses were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among study participants who contracted COVID-19, fewer than 4% required hospitalization. The vast majority had mild illness; and all participants tested negative for COVID-19 within two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors also could contribute to the documented brain aging, including “reduced physical activity, poorer diets and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-08/alcohol-abuse-pandemic-hospitals-liver-disease"&gt;increased alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;” during the pandemic, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many unanswered questions remain. If further studies do prove the pandemic-related factors caused accelerated brain aging, rather than  simply being associated with it, how long will those effects last? And, “once you have it, can you do anything to make it better?” Chin-Hong asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t answer the question of whether the accelerated brain aging is reversible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is well known that there are things that are good for general brain health, Mohammadi-Nejad said: physical activity, mental stimulation, social interaction, healthy sleep and good nutrition among them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public policies that reduce social isolation and ensure continued access to physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being during major disruptions could help mitigate future effects on brain health,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the study may raise the question of whether the pandemic-era response &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-10-12/report-uk-slow-coronavirus-lockdown-thousands-died"&gt;measures employed in Britain&lt;/a&gt; were worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But answering that question today — &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/do-not-post-californias-covid-emergency-is-over-now-what"&gt;years after COVID ceased&lt;/a&gt; to be a novel public health threat — is complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study wasn’t designed to evaluate public health policies or determine what should or shouldn’t have been done. What we show is that the pandemic experience, independent of infection, was associated with changes in brain health,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 today is very different than the dark early period of the pandemic, when the disease devastated many families, prematurely killing &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-23/covid-19-struck-at-the-heart-of-latino-family-networks"&gt;grandparents &lt;/a&gt;and leaving children to grow up without their &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-09/young-latinos-death-covid-high-rates-california"&gt;dad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-12/inland-empire-parents-of-5-children-die-of-coronavirus-weeks-apart"&gt;mom&lt;/a&gt;. The death rate was much higher in the initial phase of the emergency, with hospitals in some areas &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-11/los-angeles-coronavirus-hospitals-ambulances-horror"&gt;overwhelmed with&lt;/a&gt; staggering numbers of critically ill people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/how-common-is-long-covid-a-new-study-provides-fresh-clues"&gt;getting long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, and suffering debilitating symptoms such as brain fog or persistent fatigue, was also once much higher than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, “it was a more serious time for COVID,” Chin-Hong said. “It was a time when you didn’t want to get infected at all.... Like, who would want to get Alpha or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-24/covid-19-delta-variant-spread-california-how-bad-is-it"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, you know?” he added, referring to the variants that preceded Omicron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s version of COVID is “less invasive — even independent of the fact that we have more immunity,” Chin-Hong said. The latest subvariants of the coronavirus don’t “get inside the body as much as the earlier variants.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said he’s glad there was a time early in the pandemic where “we tried to avoid COVID as much as possible,” noting that infection itself has a chance of affecting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s also clear that health issues such loneliness have a clear effect on brain health. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the former U.S. surgeon general, issued an advisory on what he called a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-02/loneliness-isolation-epidemic-u-s-surgeon-general-declares"&gt;national epidemic of loneliness and isolation&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, and warned that loneliness is associated with a greater risk of dementia, depression, anxiety and premature death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of U.S. adults experienced loneliness even before the pandemic, according to Murthy’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which urged the public to fight loneliness and isolation by taking steps to strengthen their relationships. The British government in 2018 found loneliness to be such a public health concern that it created a new position: minister of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study underscores the idea that things such as exercise, sleep, diet, social connection and stress reduction are important for our brain health, according to Chin-Hong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolving stress and a lack of social connection “is probably as important as ... focusing on things like blood pressure and the things we traditionally think about,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQZ3h0U2RMMDdwNlV2ZF9YT1JFM0NZVWR4d1lSckNnQWV4Qk1ua1F5UDV0RWRWWVFpSUZvOS1kZG93Rl96OXVIT0lMaEdlMVJJck5MeS1CTjFSU09VbGc5RjdTWXdBMldrdVotS2tEZVB3UVlucHZOUWNTeE9iSTg4VVVOM3A4NDhOQUs1REJHcmlhZEJiTVFZTXZvQXRfTjRhMXZGQ1c5WTZYaXlxRXR1M0t2TG5xRXBuQ3dRRC1jOA</guid></item><item><title>母亲在例行补充肉毒杆菌后瘫痪后发出紧急警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOcndBZVlxV3MySGEteFE3SXhGY0dLOERBVEJPMHc5cFJfdUFlaGlKX0xaeUQ1VUJ5WlRuZXUxWG1EUEd0QmsxU3VyWXJDNFEzdl96YnVUd21POHhCZXA0bDcyZkNnZFNMVmN4SjZYclcxNXlEbHpFZzc1VEJ1bXdhUW4yQTJYRDZSWkFhMU9B0gGTAUFVX3lxTE5Ec3ZNV094Zm5zZGhfSHJsMUhzeTVXdkMzYkUyR1RZc0xlYjBVRzMyTHc5ZzVGTjdmOVRmVndzMjJQeUE2X3I2QlJNdlM4bmlDUTNqTEU3MUFmNUMzQVExU3VaN1ZueWJjZXo1LVBGd3RkdTY4bEJsbEluNmQ4SHItXzZZbEd4alM4Q0xyWmxrY2xMQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-three who was left paralysed after her routine &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/botox/index.html" id="mol-797d5e90-6c9d-11f0-afdc-4d6dd72cda91"&gt;Botox&lt;/a&gt; top-up has revealed that she spent £22,000 to get a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amanda Wolaver, 33, from Goodhope, Georgia, thought she was 'slowly dying' when her 'severe' headaches left her unable to move and made her housebound for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sales director had gone for her routine anti-wrinkle injection in her face to smooth out her crow's feet, eleven lines and forehead, and went to sleep early because she had developed a migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, she had to go to the hospital as she 'couldn't function or string sentences together'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CT scan in 2023 showed her symptoms had 'nothing to do with the injections' even though she would eventually find that not to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amanda went on to have spinal tap surgeries and had a heart monitor implanted to find the cause, with doctors suspecting MS or an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She could not cook her children's meals or leave the house, becoming wholly dependent on her husband, Josh, 39, as strong smells or loud noises would trigger her dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was the worst decision I've ever made.

a woman revealed insight into the process of having lip filler dissolved&lt;/a&gt; - and admitted that she was left looking 'botched'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia Goldstein travelled to Hart Medical in Westminster, London, a few months ago to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she said that it was 'the best thing I've ever done', the process wasn't pain-free and left her lips looking swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking to TikTok, she said, 'A few months ago, I got all my lip filler dissolved, and it was the best thing I've ever done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to share images from throughout the process, adding, 'Trigger warning, my face looked butters [ugly].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia explained that, when the aesthetician put the dissolver in her lips, they swelled drastically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda started experiencing 'severe' headaches within 24 hours of receiving her Botox treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two years on, she still is not fully recovered and is waiting for time to detoxify her body as there is no specific treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like, imagine, I have to go into work right now and they [her lips] look botched,' she said while showing her bloated lips to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued to show photographs from throughout the process, saying, 'This was pretty much just after going into work and this was the next day, my lips were black, like you can see in this video, they were so, so bruised.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia added, 'I even tried covering them up with makeup, and it was just all black above my lips.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content creator said her lips then 'shrunk', making her feel 'really young', she said, adding, 'And they also went really wrinkly.' One week later, the bruising had gone, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the process, Georgia went for an ultrasound to check if there was any filler left in her lips, before concluding that getting her fillers dissolved was the 'best thing ever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Viewers took to the comment section to share their thoughts on the end result, and one wrote, 'Great more natural result, love.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second added, 'Trust the process hun.'

            About two years ago, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank noticed a new type of patient arriving at his New York practice. Amid an explosion in the number of Americans losing weight with drugs like Ozempic, he saw a “dramatic spike” in clients experiencing unwelcome side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9b00053b6nh5thy399@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although they felt much better losing weight, in some ways they felt they looked older,” he said via a voice note. “And this was due to the loss of volume in their face.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00063b6n9ru2dikm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank started using the term “Ozempic face” — a label he believes he coined — to describe the phenomenon. It has since become a social media byword for the sagging skin and hollowed-out appearance that can accompany the use of GLP-1 medications like semaglutide (the active ingredient in branded drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00073b6ne8k7bvum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually, with people from their mid-40s and above, once you start losing 10-plus pounds, you can get this kind of deflated look,” said Frank, who is the founder of aesthetic health care brand PFRANKMD and the author of “The Pro-Aging Playbook.” “Certainly, people losing 20 or 30-plus pounds are going to have this problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Semaglutide works by stimulating the pancreas to trigger insulin production, curbing users’ appetite and contributing to feelings of fullness. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes, doctors now commonly prescribe it off-label for weight management. About &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff"&gt;1 in 8 adults&lt;/a&gt; in the US has used a GLP-1 drug, and of those, around 2 in 5 did so solely to lose weight, according to health policy non-profit KFF in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00093b6nits8ca67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, more than 20% of Frank’s patients are using GLP-1s as part of what he called their “longevity regimen.” The treatments sought after their weight loss include injectable dermal fillers to help restore facial volume, facelifts and fat transfers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000a3b6nscxngb6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can only refill a deflated balloon so much, and often surgical intervention is necessary,” he said. But for many patients, he added, “just upping the dosage of their volume replacement is more than enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000b3b6n1v7ljjqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Someone who may have used one syringe of filler in the past is now using two or three.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which publishes an annual report on surgery trends, recently &lt;a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic-surgery-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 2 in 5 of its members’ GLP-1 patients were considering undergoing cosmetic surgery — and 1 in 5 already had.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000e3b6nw9w4be7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the patients opting for a facelift was Kimberly Bongiorno, a local government land use administrator from Mount Arlington, New Jersey. Having lost weight after gastric sleeve surgery in 2019, she regained 40 pounds during the Covid-19 pandemic and was prescribed Wegovy last year. Despite describing the drug’s impact as “almost a miracle” — taking her weight from 170 to 125 pounds — the 55-year-old faced new concerns over her appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000f3b6nxhghungw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everything just kind of hung and was very loose,” she said over Zoom, recalling seeing her face in a photo shared by a friend. “I no longer felt like I had cheeks, and I had a lot of loose skin under my neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpgwxcy00053b6n8bi79p0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It looked like I had melted. It was horrifying,” she added. “It was so disheartening to see how my face looked and how it had changed, I thought I looked a lot older than I am.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000h3b6n041gk21p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After consulting plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Berlet at his New Jersey office, Bongiorno underwent a deep plane facelift that lifted her skin and repositioned some of the deeper muscles and connective tissues. She also opted for a neck lift that refined and smoothed her neck contours while addressing excess skin left by her weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000i3b6n8rlxoe1j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before I did this, I probably looked closer to 60, or maybe even older. And now I have people who I’ve recently met think I am in my 40s,” Bongiorno said, adding: “People I haven’t seen in a while say, ‘You look so healthy and happy.’ And that’s nice to hear, because for a while, I didn’t look healthy and certainly wasn’t happy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdow3oyt00013b6nqb7buaxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of facelifts performed in the US jumped 8% between 2022 and 2023, according to ASPS data. The use of hyaluronic acid fillers has meanwhile doubled from 2.6 million Americans in 2017 — the year Ozempic was first cleared for diabetes — to over 5.2 million in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000j3b6nraxx0wud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization could not attribute these upticks exclusively to GLP-1 use, but its former president, Dr. Steven Williams, said the medications have had “a global effect on aesthetic surgery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000k3b6nulksd71h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now we have a brand-new tool that actually has efficacy for so many patients,” said Williams, a board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of California’s Tri Valley Plastic Surgery, over Zoom. He noted that GLP-1s come “without substantial drawbacks” when compared with invasive procedures like gastric bypass surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000l3b6nja0cicus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can now have an honest conversation with patients about a nonsurgical tool that’s effective in weight loss,” he added. “And as part of that conversation, there’s an obligation to say, ‘Look, this is really going to work, so you have to be prepared for what looking 20 or 50 pounds slimmer is going to be.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000m3b6nfvlxtnax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The term “Ozempic face” may speak to our times, but its symptoms — caused by a decrease in the subcutaneous fat that makes our faces plump — are nothing new. Cosmetic surgeons have long been treating the side effects of significant weight loss. In fact, one popular brand of dermal filler, Sculptra, was originally developed in the 1990s for HIV patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000n3b6nqhyt41e7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an adult, “your body actually doesn’t make more fat cells,” Williams said. “As we lose or gain weight, those fat cells aren’t multiplying or decreasing; they’re getting bigger or smaller. And so as we lose weight, those fat cells now have decreased volume, and there’s just less fullness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000p3b6ntoqjs5gh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Age can determine how patients’ faces react to weight loss. People in their 20s and 30s, for instance, are far less likely to experience the appearance of aging due to GLP-1 use, Frank said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000q3b6n052s2fcs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because they have good skin elasticity, the skin rebounds much better,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000r3b6nvdudpl87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients aged 20 to 39 accounted for 14% of hyaluronic acid filler use in the US and just 2% of facelift procedures last year, according to the ASPS. But both figures are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/style/facelift-surgery-young-patients"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000s3b6n1l8jyodb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gabriela Vasquez, 29, is among the younger patients using GLP-1 to undergo cosmetic procedures after rapid weight loss. An employee of one of Williams’ Tri Valley Plastic Surgery clinics, she has dropped around 50 pounds since starting Ozempic in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000t3b6nlq5l8uoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Vasquez is still working toward her target weight, she sought preventative Botox injections (more visible lines and wrinkles are, along with thinning lips, among the other &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/ozempic-face-and-other-glp-1-side-effects" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 use). She has also recently undergone microneedling, a procedure used to stimulate collagen production.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000u3b6nhcpzar5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my concerns was my jowls, because I felt I saw them when I was a little heavier,” she said over Zoom from the Bay Area. “I think the microneedling definitely helped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpl54mn00043b6nye61yyaf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I never had a jaw line,” she added. “And a couple weeks ago, someone took a picture of me, and I had one, and I was like, ‘Well, that’s new.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000v3b6n0wme1p23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vasquez did not rule out further cosmetic procedures as she continues losing weight — and not only to her face and neck. “I’m seeing little things in my body that I’m like, ‘Whoa, that would be nice to take care of,’” she said, referencing the appearance of excess skin under her arms. “I could see myself — later down the line, once I get to my goal weight — doing something to kind of tighten everything up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000w3b6nnbhl90lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank, the cosmetic dermatologist, noted that “Ozempic face” may be accompanied by a phenomenon he dubbed “Ozempic body,” adding: “One of the other major side effects of weight loss, particularly when it’s done at a rate of more than one to two pounds a week, is muscle loss. And we see this all over the body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000x3b6nnq6mmi40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ASPS similarly notes the emerging term “Ozempic makeover,” a suite of procedures that might also include tummy tucks, breast lifts and arm, thigh and buttock lifts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000y3b6nxxzvj3iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, Bongiorno, the New Jersey facelift patient, has also undergone several other procedures with Dr. Berlet, including arm and thigh lifts, to address her excess skin. She estimates that after her upcoming breast lift, fat grafting and lower eyelid surgery, she will have spent about $80,000 on cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000z3b6n6upj7dqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Skin is heavy and uncomfortable,” she said. “This wasn’t something I did to go out there and be a supermodel. It was just to be comfortable, so I could get clothes on and not feel like I was dragging around all this extra weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00113b6n3dcdzvt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The long-term effect of GLP-1 medications on cosmetic medicine is yet to be fully understood. The assumption they might reduce demand for liposuction, for instance, has not come to bear: It remains the most common cosmetic surgical procedure in the US, growing in popularity by 1% last year, per ASPS data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00123b6nly8v4bdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What also remains to be seen is the effect that “Ozempic rebound” — when patients regain weight after stopping the drugs — has on people who sought cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00133b6nt12hy9ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; found that most people using the drugs for weight loss quit within a year. Data presented at this year’s European Congress on Obesity meanwhile suggested that patients typically returned to their original weight within 10 months of stopping use, with University of Oxford researchers calling the findings a “cautionary note” about using medication “without a more comprehensive approach” to weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00143b6n3bbrn2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Williams, this further demonstrates why he and his plastic surgeon colleagues must take responsibility for their patients’ “entire journey,” not just their cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00153b6nauifw6cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want these patients to be on these medications for a lifetime. We want it to be a temporary bridge to a healthier lifestyle,” he said, adding: “It’s our obligation to work harder with those patients, to talk about lifestyle changes, to get them plugged in to dietitians and to make sure that they’re building muscle and exercising.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Dozens of drugs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079219300504?via%3Dihub"&gt;have failed to show efficacy&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials, and while HGNS was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014, Miller says that its rollout has been limited, as many doctors are uncertain about the risk-to-benefit trade-off. “The device is quite costly, and the implantation requires a surgical procedure,” he explains, which comes with added risk to the patient. “As with any new technology, there is often a lag in acceptance from both the medical community and insurers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s unlikely that a single therapy will be found as an alternative to CPAP, Gaisl argues, because sleep apnea isn’t one single disease—rather, a diverse cluster of conditions. Obesity is known to be one of the major risk factors—and the weight-loss drug tirzepatide has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-medication-obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;recently been licensed&lt;/a&gt; as a sleep apnea therapy—because excess fat around the neck and upper body can obstruct the airway and cause pauses in breathing. But there are many other causes, some of which are only recently coming to light. Researchers are now beginning to understand the impact of ethnicity on sleep apnea, for example, with patients in Asia at &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21992683/"&gt;heightened risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Sleep apnea is resultant of “a mosaic of different things, not just obesity,” says Gaisl. “We’re increasingly seeing that different subgroups benefit most from more personalized approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This recognition has led researchers to focus more on the EDS population. Gaisl estimates that simply having EDS is equivalent to increasing your BMI by 11 points in terms of the likelihood of developing sleep apnea. That’s because the genes linked to EDS affect the structure of so-called “matrix proteins” like collagen and elastin, which provide the framework for the body’s connective tissues—everything from skin to tendons, muscles, and ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Collagen is an integral part of almost all tissues, including those which form the airway,” says Karim Ghobrial-Sedky, an adjunct professor at Drexel University and a sleep specialist who has treated EDS patients with sleep apnea. “In EDS, it’s this abnormality in collagen which makes the airway more prone to collapsing when the person is taking a breath.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Because of this, researchers believe that EDS sleep apnea patients are especially suited to treatments targeting muscles in the tongue and throat—like Miller’s HGNS, or a newer drug combination under development by a company called Apnimed. Based on the discovery that two compounds, atomoxetine and aroxybutynin, could work in synergy to improve upper airway muscle tone and reduce airway muscle relaxation during sleep, Apnimed has been shown &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/sleep-apnea-pill-shows-striking-success-large-clinical-trial"&gt;in a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to reduce instances of sleep apnea by 56 percent. “People with hypermobility are a prime target cohort for these kinds of therapies,” says Gaisl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549814/"&gt;EDS was long considered rare&lt;/a&gt;, recent studies &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/11/e031365"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; genetic hypermobility may affect as many as 1 in 500 people, with women disproportionately affected. Gaisl believes the underlying biology behind these conditions also offers clues for explaining other subtypes of sleep apnea. In his view, the genetics of EDS actively mirrors the damage which other people are inadvertently inflicting on their matrix proteins through behaviors and environmental stresses like smoking, chronic inflammation, excessive dietary sugar and the aging process itself, heightening their risk of sleep apnea through midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“EDS is a kind of natural experiment which is giving us insights into some of the key biological mechanisms behind sleep apnea that are masked in the general population,” says Gaisl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Such individuals could benefit more from targeted therapies like HGNS or Apnimed’s drug combination, compared with patients whose apnea is primarily driven by weight gain or underlying breathing abnormalities. Newer diagnostics are applying AI algorithms to patients’ sleep data, pinpointing key patterns that suggest a specific type of airway collapse. In the future, these tools could help clinicians to identify such people both faster and more accurately, as well as individuals with undiagnosed hypermobility. These insights could then be used to tailor their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As researchers learn more about the role of matrix proteins in EDS-related sleep apnea, it could even pave the way for entirely new treatments in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Matrix proteins “really point to the importance of collagen in maintaining the airway during sleep,” says Gaisl. “This opens up a new avenue for therapeutics which perhaps target how the connective tissues are impacted over time, causing sleep apnea—treatments which could ultimately benefit a much broader range of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBMNGlYUVBZT1BFQ2JFMjduLXF5Ym9TdEFrTWNzcnFFa0E2Q1dkZDFteGZrbzRjbUItajE1MEp1M2J5aGJZNzg3X1JDUFlFeUhVYVJycjFnbjNvbnNxUlNraVhPbFZOUQ</guid></item><item><title>我在医院内外度过了童年。19岁时，我终于意识到我患有晚期疾病- theguardian.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQVV9ySEJERmdLMV9KQWhTVjY4OXI4Unh5RnMxczloem9lZlZEYkdtZTBVY1ZNQjJGeS1yVlZkUU1IREhYM2s5STNRaHE4eXZYVk55TlY0WTZjSnAzRUZJcDZjQ3NPVDAtd1lERnltXzBJNUNhM0g5clh2NjFTejBqTmFtZHR4NGhkRTVWZUpiRmtLRDQ2cXNZMWtpTkxxaW9NY3JFSjl4eUNlSEpfQ3pMd05wNHlvb0lvSnRpV0M5YUwyaWRocXlzSkVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;vonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapel&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in Glasgow. For three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown. That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t notice I wasn’t there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/series/how-we-survive","type":"Series","title":"How we survive"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/cystic-fibrosis","type":"Keyword","title":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/paulacocozza","type":"Contributor","title":"Paula Cocozza","twitterHandle":"CocozzaPaula","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382620904259/Paula-Cocozza.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=5fb020dc0b4c8b67416423a48d539385"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"lifeandstyle/2025/jul/30/i-spent-childhood-in-out-hospital-at-19-finally-realised-had-terminal-disease","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to resist it. When she was growing up, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cystic-fibrosis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt; was considered “a childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now 52, and enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later, Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her one-hour show, &lt;a href="https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/yvonne-hughes-absolutely-riddled" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Absolutely Riddled&lt;/a&gt;, which she is performing at the Edinburgh fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when so many didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ab5dfed0-a7d8-4100-990f-c1cb4844da92" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘My mum said: “We thought you were going to die, every day”’ … Hughes, far right, with her hospital friends on a day trip in 1984. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness; she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person, but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something. I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Roughly one in every 2,500 people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Only as she grew older did Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me: ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became their new normal to keep me alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes around why those people died”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ef167e92-7322-4878-b506-9ba8e789f235" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I thought there was no point telling people because everyone was dealing with something. I was nothing special.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She found solace in the &lt;a href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cystic Fibrosis Trust&lt;/a&gt; magazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7513755/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implemented &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2443994/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a policy of segregation&lt;/a&gt;, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs that &lt;a href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/how-does-cystic-fibrosis-affect-the-body/symptoms-of-cystic-fibrosis/lungs/bugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;might lead to cross-infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She has stayed in touch by phone with one old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought: ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her 20s and 30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of philosophical things got me through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now – “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout – at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going, pay my bills and mortgage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital, there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers, things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness. Didn’t she feel aggrieved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5d105e5a-32ce-4299-9905-e9ea3244dd7f" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I just got on with it.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Yvonne Hughes/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While Hughes survived childhood by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I couldn’t have a career because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist. “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2018, aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as public affairs officer at the CF Trust.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eating was difficult. Her weight hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point, there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-factual-medical-reports-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals/the-special-rules-how-the-benefit-system-supports-people-nearing-the-end-of-life" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;end-of-life form&lt;/a&gt;, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung function was down to 26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Kaftrio turned Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects – insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long, she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Energised, she decided to enrol in an evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the University of Strathclyde’s &lt;a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/studywithus/centreforlifelonglearning/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Centre for Lifelong Learning&lt;/a&gt;, it was the flyer for comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs. Something clicked and I enrolled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She performed a five-minute set for the course finale – and immediately wanted to do it again. “I started applying for clubs, &lt;a href="https://www.monkeybarrelcomedy.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Monkey Barrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thestand.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the Stand Comedy Club&lt;/a&gt; [both in Edinburgh]. I got Red Raw [the Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there. I want to change my life,” she says, “and I am doing comedy to see if I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; change my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8cefb39e-5e31-48a6-a2bd-ee5ea2cfc252" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Comedy was the one thing that was for me’ … Hughes performing at Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Yvonne Hughes/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nearly four years ago, Hughes met her partner, Alan, online. Having spent a lifetime feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one – and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses. Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan, and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had to take a – &lt;em&gt;haa!&lt;/em&gt; – sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across her, after fastening it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll probably live to get my pension.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter” back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that was for me. And it still is. Just for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQVV9ySEJERmdLMV9KQWhTVjY4OXI4Unh5RnMxczloem9lZlZEYkdtZTBVY1ZNQjJGeS1yVlZkUU1IREhYM2s5STNRaHE4eXZYVk55TlY0WTZjSnAzRUZJcDZjQ3NPVDAtd1lERnltXzBJNUNhM0g5clh2NjFTejBqTmFtZHR4NGhkRTVWZUpiRmtLRDQ2cXNZMWtpTkxxaW9NY3JFSjl4eUNlSEpfQ3pMd05wNHlvb0lvSnRpV0M5YUwyaWRocXlzSkVB</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，一次锻炼可以将癌细胞生长减少30% - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNklUOXA3OUJSdGJxVFNlZFZybXAtWGtwTzY1MDdGTW9uSk0zd01mTF9rYm5WT285VWdNclQwaHFVekFVVjE2SFhiRFo4d2ZqOFgtdlhkNGRPaDgzNWxoeDdMVEhCUEVxYXRRMGpoeEpjNHBhNm1tM3dkWjBZMFNoTHBEOFA1SkhsQUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:21:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNklUOXA3OUJSdGJxVFNlZFZybXAtWGtwTzY1MDdGTW9uSk0zd01mTF9rYm5WT285VWdNclQwaHFVekFVVjE2SFhiRFo4d2ZqOFgtdlhkNGRPaDgzNWxoeDdMVEhCUEVxYXRRMGpoeEpjNHBhNm1tM3dkWjBZMFNoTHBEOFA1SkhsQUE</guid></item><item><title>减少腹部脂肪：专家分享9种自然缩小腹部脂肪的方法-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPVmwwRFdIRWtPNFRzX3dVOU56MWhmakVGeE5PcGg4dVQ5MXdsOFVGODcyNGp1c0VRUmYtS0kzQm1LV3R2MC1zZnBldlRTaG5RelFJdDBFX2EwVGJTaVZ2YVF0Z3NMZkJCeEpySnJWRVhTclMxMDJ0TUxaLW1LSktEZ1lTaFdzLTNBVDFOX3gwN0xCWTdaT0pVWi1BT2dKZXFyNElNRlNxVHR4cl90aUxxQWRROVBIR0FOdDYtMGxHMFlwajlYWDlsQUw5WW1wYTM1RXF6QXpDb05CRThPREttWFJIRmo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucked deep inside your body, there’s a type of fat that doesn’t just sit there — it stirs up trouble. It surrounds your organs, messes with your metabolism, and quietly raises your risk for things like heart disease, diabetes, and more. It’s called visceral fat, and the kicker is, you don’t have to look overweight to have too much of it. Spot reduction is not really an option, but certaian tweaks in the routine can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, even slim folks can carry dangerous levels of visceral fat — a condition sometimes referred to as “skinny fat.” Unlike the soft layer just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), this kind hides out around your liver, kidneys, intestines, and heart, fueling inflammation and silently working against your health. Visceral fat increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and even Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 workouts to cut down that belly fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you’ve got too much visceral fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visceral fat is about 10% of your body’s total fat mass, that’s normal and healthy, according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Generally, if your waist measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, it may be time to take notice. But don’t cheat the tape, breathe out naturally and wrap it just above your hip bones, right around the belly button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hint is your muscle-to-fat ratio. If you’ve lost muscle and gained fat, especially as you age, that imbalance can mean more visceral fat inside, even if the scale doesn’t budge much. Tools like DEXA scans or smart body composition scales can offer more insight, but the everyday clues, low energy, weight gain around your midsection, or poor sleep, are often just as telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Chappel, on his social media page, recently shared nine habits that can naturally shrink visceral fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid late-night eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating close to bedtime isn’t just about calories, it affects hormones like insulin, cortisol, and glucose, which all play a role in fat storage. Try shifting your biggest meals to earlier in the day and giving your body a few hours of fasting before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the cold&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure, like a quick 1–2 minute cold shower or using an ice pack a few times a week, can activate brown fat, which burns energy to produce heat. It’s not a miracle fix, but it can help reduce waistline over time when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about your workouts. Daily movement that isn’t “exercise”, like walking while on the phone, cleaning the house, or taking the stairs, actually burns a surprising amount of fat. It’s called NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and it adds up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apple cider vinegar before meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a tablespoon of diluted apple cider vinegar about 10 minutes before meals has been shown to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. Stable blood sugar means less fat storage, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep isn’t just rest, it’s a reset button for your hormones. Getting less than 6 hours a night over time is linked to significant increases in visceral fat. Aim for 7 to 9 hours, cut screen time before bed, and sleep in a cool, dark room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add more soluble fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar, supports gut health, and improves insulin sensitivity, all of which play a part in reducing belly fat. Some good sources: avocados, oats, flaxseeds, and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethink your cooking oils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly processed oils like canola, soybean, and corn oil can fuel inflammation, which plays a big role in fat gain. Instead, reach for olive oil, avocado oil, or even grass-fed butter in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lift weights &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training just two or three times a week can lower visceral fat, even if your weight doesn’t drop. Building muscle improves insulin sensitivity, which helps your body manage fat storage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start your day with protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping protein in the morning is a missed opportunity. A breakfast with 30–40 grams of protein helps reduce hunger later in the day and keeps blood sugar levels steady. Try eggs, Greek yogurt, a protein shake, or lean meats like turkey sausage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

						&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County is experiencing a “mild summer surge” in COVID-19 infections, with most cases being treated in outpatient clinics, Dr. Gary Green, a Sutter Health infectious disease specialist, said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday afternoon, 22% of all people with symptoms tested in Sutter clinics and outpatient medical offices came back positive for COVID-19. In contrast, only 8% of symptomatic patients tested in Sutter’s emergency department have tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said he does not expect the number of COVID-19 infections to reach as high as they did last summer. By late July 2024,&lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/covid-summer-surge-sonoma-napa-counties/" id="link-9194ab03a09121e6607f90593b3c7626" target="_self"&gt; 50% of all nasal swabs done in Sutter outpatient clinics were turning up positive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Napa County, the COVID caseload remains flat, the county’s top health official said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Green said he expected more cases across the region into the final weeks of summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We may see as many cases, but I think the severity is going to be much more mild,” he said. “As the population sees COVID over and over and over again, we build up better immunity.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Karen Smith, Sonoma County’s interim health officer, said COVID-19 infections are starting to increase following mild winter and spring seasons. She said virus detection in wastewater nationwide has been increasing, especially in the western U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the latest wastewater scan of COVID-19 in the Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park urban area, viral levels are at 64% of maximum historical levels. Last summer, viral levels in local wastewater peaked in late July at 85% of maximum historic levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hawaii and Florida are having the highest rates, but we’re starting to see that in California and that is a harbinger of the fact that we’re going to see more cases as well,” Smith said. “But we’re not as high as we were last year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said recent COVID-19 cases have been “pretty mild” in the general population, with most severe cases occurring among people who are at high risk, such as pregnant women and people with immunosuppressive conditions such as diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven't seen much in the way of ICU admissions or even hospital admissions,” Smith said. “So that's great and that's what we're keeping our fingers crossed we’re going to continue seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christine Wu, Napa County’s health officer and public health director, said COVID-19 detection in wastewater is currently at low viral levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reports of hospitalizations and deaths also remain low,” Wu said in an email Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confusing guidance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news of a summer bump in COVID-19 cases comes as some health care professionals and officials are openly challenging vaccine recommendations now coming from Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Heath Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women, calling the move “common sense” and “good science.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy is &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/" id="link-493d47b01616f3cb8b2019f09d43e3e5" target="_self"&gt;reportedly planning to remove all members the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, an advisory panel that weighs in on what cancer screenings and other preventative health services insurers should cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said U.S. health agencies which have been a model, a “paradigm for the rest of the world.” But the Trump administration’s changes in the CDC are being executed under leadership that doesn’t adhere to science and is often politically motivated, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said Sutter Health, one of the largest health care providers in Northern California, is aligning with medical guidance coming from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which does recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant women. He said most health care clinicians, including Sutter, will be recommending the vaccine for healthy children, though it is not a school-mandated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said that healthy children run a much smaller risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and influenza. But he said that while most kids will not develop severe COVID-19 illness, a small number will require hospitalization and some died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine reduce the risk of serious illness, and they “lower the viral burden” in a community, reducing the risk of transmission to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jessica August, an infectious disease expert for Kaiser Permanente, the region’s largest health care provider, said she’ll adhere to guidance from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which rejected Kennedy’s revamp of recommendations in May. The group urged insurers to continue existing coverage for Americans who chose to get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect and are planning on offering COVID-19 vaccination to those ages 6 months and older in the upcoming season,” August said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, the Sonoma County interim health officer, pointed out that the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices did not completely pull its COVID-19 vaccine recommendation for “health children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advisory body recommended that parents of children ages 6 months to 17 years should consult with their medical provider about whether to give their kids the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Hodes, chief medical officer of Providence Sonoma County, which operates the largest local hospital network, said in an email Providence has also seen an recent uptick in COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodes said “from an adult infectious disease perspective, we will continue to recommend the most updated COVID-19 vaccination for adults 18 years and older.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodes said Providence obstetrics department will also be following the recommendations of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which “recommends vaccination during pregnancy for the benefits of maternal and fetal well-being.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We recommend continuing COVID vaccinations for all pediatric patients (older than) 6 months, but especially those at highest risk (asthma, medical complexity, etc.),” Hodes said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetened dairy is a source of added sugar in the diet, so opt for unsweetened when you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy contains protein, calcium, phosphorus and potassium to support overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use dairy in a variety of recipes from smoothies and desserts, to main dishes and sandwiches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever eaten a spoonful of flavored yogurt, you know just how sweet it can be. Most dairy products contain some sugar because lactose—aka milk sugar—is a sugar. However, naturally occurring lactose is considered a natural sugar. But some varieties of dairy products—yogurts, ice cream, kefir, cottage cheese—might also contain added sugars if they’re flavored. After all, sweetened dairy products are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899305/top-sources-of-added-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;top sources of added sugar in our diet&lt;/a&gt;, but unsweetened dairy provides many essential vitamins and minerals. “Dairy is a fantastic source of micronutrients that support bone health, including calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus,” says &lt;a href="https://www.goodgutnutritionist.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian specializing in gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re looking to reduce your intake of added sugar, you don’t have to give up dairy. Instead, opt for dairy foods that are free of added sugar. That way you’ll get all of the protein and bone-fortifying and muscle-growing nutrients minus the sweet stuff. Here are six dairy foods that are low in sugar—and delicious ideas for incorporating them into your routine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-plain-greek-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Plain Greek Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nonfat or low-fat plain strained Greek-style yogurts are high in protein and are lower in saturated fat. “It’s a great substitute for sour cream and can easily be added to a variety of meals and snacks to increase protein and calcium intake,” says &lt;a href="https://dietitianinsights.com/dietitians/eliza-whitaker-ms-rdn" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eliza Whitaker, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and medical nutrition advisor at Dietitian Insights. Protein in dairy is important for growth, immunity, tissue repair and hormone production. Studies show that regularly consuming dairy products positively impacts muscle mass in middle-aged and older adults. That’s especially important because muscle mass declines with age, which is linked to reduced physical function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, most Greek yogurts contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; that support gut health. “Probiotics can help reduce inflammation and bloating and promote regular bowel movements,” says Conlon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that consuming yogurt and other fermented milk products is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, breast cancer and type 2 diabetes, along with improved bone, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One container (150 grams) of unsweetened nonfat plain Greek yogurt contains 5 grams of natural sugar and 15 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rather than buying a flavored yogurt, mix in your favorite fresh fruit at home for added fiber and vitamins.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s time to pour yourself a glass of this probiotic sip. “Kefir is a nutrient-dense, fermented dairy product offering several scientifically backed health benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-trifan-ms-rd-2812921b4/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julia Trifan, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a research dietitian at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir is rich in probiotics and also has anti-inflammatory properties. According to research, kefir can reduce the production of several proinflammatory proteins in the body, helping decrease inflammation and reduce the risk of complications from viruses, Trifan explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One cup of plain kefir contains 7 grams of natural sugar and 10 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try it by itself or use it as the base of a smoothie.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Another versatile, low-sugar dairy product is cottage cheese,” says Whitaker. One cup of low-fat cottage cheese contains 9 grams of natural sugar and 24 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is used in the body for muscle building and maintenance, as well as enzyme and hormone production, proper immune system function, and fluid and electrolyte balance. “It’s also satiating and can leave you feeling full for longer. Plus, increasing protein intake above the recommended daily allowance may be beneficial for maintaining a healthy weight,” Whitaker adds. You can calculate &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;how much protein you need to eat&lt;/a&gt; every day using our handy tool.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Milk is one of the most nutrient-dense and balanced foods there is. It contains protein, carbohydrates and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-whole-milk-healthy-8430768" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary fat&lt;/a&gt;. (Unless you buy skim milk, of course.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One 8-ounce glass of 1% milk provides about 8 grams of protein and 12 grams of sugar and provides calcium, vitamin D and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Potassium found in dairy products supports heart health, adequate hydration and fluid balance and helps prevent hypertension, stroke and kidney stones. Low potassium intake may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,” says Whitaker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the sugar content might seem high, all of the sugar in milk is from naturally occurring lactose, and there are no added sugars in unflavored milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-ricotta-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Ricotta Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ricotta cheese is naturally low in sugar, making it a great choice for those looking to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying rich and creamy textures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ricotta cheese is made from whey, the liquid by-product of cheese production, so it only has small amounts of lactose, the natural sugar found in milk. Ricotta is also packed with high-quality protein and calcium. One ½-cup serving of low-fat ricotta cheese has 12 grams of protein and 6 grams of natural sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating ricotta into your diet can enhance both sweet and savory dishes, adding nutritional value without the extra sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-hard-cheeses"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Hard Cheeses &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hard cheeses like Cheddar, Swiss and Parmesan are also excellent low-sugar dairy options that can be enjoyed regularly. They undergo a longer aging process that breaks down most of their lactose. This not only may make them suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance, but it also makes them lower in sugar. A 1-ounce (about ¼ cup grated) serving of Parmesan contains 8 grams of protein and 0 grams of sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hard cheeses also provide protein and calcium, along with other essential nutrients like phosphorus and vitamin A. They make a great addition to many meals and can be added to fruit or crackers to make a balanced snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients, and there are health benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating dairy every day&lt;/a&gt;. While dairy contains lactose, a sugar naturally found in milk, you can easily find low-sugar dairy products to incorporate into meals and snacks. Enjoy plain varieties of strained Greek-style yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir, ricotta, milk and hard cheeses. There’s a lot of internet chatter claiming that dairy is inflammatory, with recommendations to avoid it. However, there’s evidence that eating dairy may help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056066/heres-what-a-dietitian-says-about-dairy-causing-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. “The only reason one should avoid dairy is if they have a milk protein allergy or lactose intolerance, and even people with lactose intolerance can still enjoy some dairy products,” says Conlon.

Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;almost all are fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;One infection in a body of water doesn’t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water.

It’s also high in sugar (Getty)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, for many, the problem lies with just how good watermelon tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is because of its natural sugar content. It’s packed with around 17 grams, which is more than antioxidant-rich berries but much less than pineapple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still the Cleveland Clinic advises that people with diabetes moderate how much watermelon they eat because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I guess if all you ate every day was watermelon, that would be a problem,” registered dietician nutritionist Jessica Plowman told &lt;a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/food/i-ate-watermelon-every-day-for-a-week-heres-what-happened/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Healthy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Healthy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

							&lt;p data-start="281" data-end="390"&gt;We live in a world where “wellness” has become a buzzword, but disease still creeps in through the back door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="392" data-end="552"&gt;Everywhere you look, there’s another green juice, another detox kit, another celebrity-endorsed superfood promising to clean out your insides and give you glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="554" data-end="599"&gt;And yet, cancer rates remain alarmingly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="601" data-end="698"&gt;Despite the yoga apps, the mushroom powders, and the clean beauty swaps—we’re still getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="700" data-end="887"&gt;But there’s one diet change—backed by decades of research—that continues to stand out. One that consistently lowers cancer risk, supports immunity, and improves long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="889" data-end="920"&gt;It’s not sexy. It’s not trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="922" data-end="942"&gt;It’s just… veganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="11svawb" data-start="944" data-end="990"&gt;The plant-based connection you can’t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="992" data-end="1033"&gt;I know. The word alone can be polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1035" data-end="1238"&gt;But hear me out—not from a moral soapbox, but from a health-conscious, evidence-following, former-skeptic who used to eat turkey sandwiches every day for lunch and believed cheese was its own food group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1240" data-end="1346"&gt;I’m not writing this to shame anyone. I’m writing this because the science is there—and we’re ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1348" data-end="1548"&gt;Multiple large-scale studies have shown that a vegan diet—meaning one that excludes all animal products—correlates with a reduced risk of several cancers, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1550" data-end="1806"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="1576" data-end="1590"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which followed over 470,000 people in the UK, found that vegans had &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02256-w?.com"&gt;a 14% lower risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to meat-eaters. The difference was especially pronounced for hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1808" data-end="1954"&gt;Other studies have suggested that a vegan diet may reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress—two key contributors to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1956" data-end="2122"&gt;And it’s not just about removing animal products. It’s about replacing them with fiber-rich, nutrient-dense plant foods that flood the body with protective compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2124" data-end="2191"&gt;As Dr. T. Colin Campbell, author of &lt;em data-start="2160" data-end="2177"&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, once said: “The closer people come to an all-plant, whole-food diet, the lower their risk for chronic disease—especially cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="ppfc5" data-start="2314" data-end="2340"&gt;But what about protein?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2342" data-end="2411"&gt;That’s the first question I asked when I first considered this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2413" data-end="2637"&gt;For years, we’ve been trained to see meat as synonymous with protein. Never mind that lentils, quinoa, tofu, tempeh, beans, and even broccoli all contain plenty of protein—without the cholesterol and carcinogenic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;The truth is, most people in developed countries consume more protein than they actually need—often at the expense of fiber, which the average person is &lt;em data-start="2792" data-end="2802"&gt;woefully&lt;/em&gt; deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;According to USDA data, adults in wealthier nations typically exceed protein requirements (around 103 g/day versus the ~56 g RDA), yet average fibre intake hovers around just 10–20 g/day—&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/78/Supplement_1/29/5877740?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;far below the recommended&lt;/a&gt; 25–30 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2818" data-end="3053"&gt;And guess what? Fiber doesn’t just help with digestion. It also plays a key role in binding and eliminating excess hormones and carcinogens from the body—something that’s especially important when we talk about breast and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3055" data-end="3157"&gt;A plant-based diet gives you both: enough protein and more fiber than any meat-centric meal ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="kskko8" data-start="3159" data-end="3193"&gt;So why don’t more people do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3195" data-end="3231"&gt;Honestly? Because it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3233" data-end="3361"&gt;Because it goes against tradition, against cravings, against that comforting childhood memory of grilled cheese and tomato soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3363" data-end="3471"&gt;Because the idea of “giving up” animal products feels like a punishment, even when the benefits are glaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3473" data-end="3632"&gt;We’re creatures of habit. We like our routines. We don’t want to read labels, explain our choices at dinner parties, or say no to Mom’s famous chicken pot pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3634" data-end="3745"&gt;I’ve been there. I used to roll my eyes at vegans at work potlucks, thinking they were overcomplicating things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3747" data-end="3850"&gt;But then I started noticing how good they looked. Clear skin. Energy after lunch. No afternoon crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;And when I started reading the research—not the headlines, but the actual studies—I couldn’t unsee what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Studies show that plant-based diets rich in whole foods and antioxidants significantly&lt;a href="https://www.learnskin.com/articles/plant-based-diet-and-what-it-does-for-skin-health/?.com"&gt; improve skin health&lt;/a&gt;, aiding conditions like acne, psoriasis, and eczema—likely through reduced inflammation and a healthier gut–skin axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Similarly, clinical reviews confirm that a whole-food, plant-centric diet is linked to&lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/05/a-large-study-in-the-u-s-and-europe-confirms-the-health-benefits-of-plant-based-diets/?.com"&gt; greater energy&lt;/a&gt;, better mood, and reduced post-lunch fatigue—thanks to steady blood sugar and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;So while it may feel inconvenient to change your habits or explain your choices, science was already changing—and confirming—what I was seeing in front of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="szagdv" data-start="3964" data-end="4012"&gt;My turning point wasn’t dramatic—it was quiet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4014" data-end="4072"&gt;It didn’t happen after a diagnosis or a documentary binge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4074" data-end="4183"&gt;It was a slow unraveling. A breadcrumb trail of facts that started building into something I couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4185" data-end="4440"&gt;I was flipping through a medical journal in a waiting room when I stumbled across a study linking dairy consumption to increased breast cancer risk. A week later, I read about the carcinogenic compounds formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4442" data-end="4630"&gt;Then came the meta-analysis linking meat-heavy diets with cancer mortality. The one that showed a fourfold increase in cancer risk among middle-aged adults who ate a lot of animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4632" data-end="4662"&gt;And I thought—what am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4664" data-end="4784"&gt;I’ve always been a believer in prevention. In showing up early to the problem instead of cleaning up after the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="4812"&gt;So I started cutting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4848"&gt;First meat. Then dairy. Then eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4850" data-end="4988"&gt;I didn’t become a different person overnight. I just became someone more interested in my long-term health than my short-term convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="1yq7kqb" data-start="4990" data-end="5027"&gt;The benefits weren’t just physical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5029" data-end="5100"&gt;Within a few weeks, I felt lighter—not just in my body, but in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5102" data-end="5171"&gt;I had more energy during the day. Fewer stomach issues. Better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5173" data-end="5227"&gt;But there was something else I hadn’t expected: peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5229" data-end="5377"&gt;Because making that choice every day—to eat in a way that aligned with both the science &lt;em data-start="5317" data-end="5322"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my values—didn’t feel restrictive. It felt empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5379" data-end="5435"&gt;I wasn’t just avoiding disease. I was choosing vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5437" data-end="5581"&gt;And maybe that’s why this shift is so misunderstood. Because it gets lumped into a category of deprivation, when really, it’s about nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="t7fko6" data-start="5583" data-end="5609"&gt;It’s not all or nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5611" data-end="5690"&gt;Let me be clear: you don’t need to label yourself a vegan to reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5692" data-end="5758"&gt;This isn’t a purity contest. It’s about direction, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5760" data-end="5937"&gt;Even moving toward a more plant-based lifestyle—like eating vegan meals most of the week or replacing animal products where it’s easy—can have measurable impacts on your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5939" data-end="6003"&gt;Plant-based diets reduce the risk of cancer by &lt;a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/plant-based-diets-follow-national-recommendations-reduce-inflammation?.com"&gt;supporting immune function&lt;/a&gt; and reducing inflammation and hormone levels associated with tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6158" data-end="6234"&gt;That’s not niche advice. That’s rooted in decades of public health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6236" data-end="6286"&gt;So no, you don’t have to become a tofu evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6288" data-end="6366"&gt;But you &lt;em data-start="6296" data-end="6303"&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; start by swapping your morning omelet for oatmeal and berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6368" data-end="6407"&gt;Or trying a bean chili instead of beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6409" data-end="6459"&gt;Or saying yes to that almond milk latte next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6461" data-end="6481"&gt;Every choice counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="nfbd1k" data-start="6483" data-end="6521"&gt;Cancer doesn’t wait for convenience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6523" data-end="6650"&gt;We like to believe we have time. That we’ll change when things slow down, or after the holidays, or when we’re finally “ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6652" data-end="6730"&gt;But cancer doesn’t wait for the perfect moment. And neither should prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6732" data-end="6839"&gt;Our food choices are among the most powerful tools we have—and yet they’re often the last thing we address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6841" data-end="6867"&gt;Not because we don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6869" data-end="6923"&gt;But because we’re afraid of what change might cost us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6925" data-end="6998"&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned: the cost of not changing is often much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="6w7uql" data-start="7000" data-end="7018"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7020" data-end="7057"&gt;I’m not here to tell you what to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7152"&gt;I’m just inviting you to think bigger about what your diet is doing &lt;em data-start="7127" data-end="7132"&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you—or against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7154" data-end="7272"&gt;Veganism isn’t about rules or righteousness. It’s about reclaiming agency in a world that profits off our poor habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7274" data-end="7439"&gt;It’s about recognizing that our bodies are capable of extraordinary healing—when we stop feeding them things that harm and start flooding them with things that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7441" data-end="7462"&gt;And yes, it’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7524"&gt;Maybe not emotionally simple. Maybe not logistically simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7526" data-end="7573"&gt;But biologically? Metabolically? Statistically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7575" data-end="7655"&gt;It’s one of the simplest, most powerful levers we can pull for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7657" data-end="7696"&gt;So before you dismiss it, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7698" data-end="7779"&gt;What’s one small shift I could make today to give my body a better shot tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7781" data-end="7798"&gt;Then start there.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The parents of 12-year-old Jaysen Carr, who &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; after contracting a rare &lt;a href="/article/news/health/jaysen-carr-identified-amoeba-death-lake-murray-suspected/101-ddc9dd05-eacf-4528-987d-97b55e2e84d1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;, spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday, calling on state agencies and lawmakers to take action so that no other family experiences the pain they are now facing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jason should still be here,” Jaysen’s father, Clarence Carr, said during a news conference in Columbia. “There’s absolutely no excuse why he shouldn't be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen died on July 18 after being hospitalized for over a week and a half. His family said the infection came after he swam in Lake Murray over the July 4th holiday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs were joined by their attorney, Tyler Bailey, who said the family has not been contacted by any public health or environmental agency following their son's death. Bailey identified the cause of death as &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;, an amoeba that thrives in warm freshwater and is almost always fatal once symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not one agency has reached out. There’s never been any testing of the water. No questioning of where Jaysen was swimming,” Bailey said. “We’re doing the work the agencies should have done.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen’s father shared how the illness progressed. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just assumed it was a regular migraine or headache,” Clarence Carr said. “But in hindsight, this was no headache. He was being attacked.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from the lake, his son complained of a headache. “We gave him some Tylenol, and he said he felt better,” Clarence Carr said. “The next day he felt the same, so we went to the ER.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after a hospital visit and antibiotics, Jaysen’s condition worsened. Eventually, doctors performed a spinal tap to test for meningitis. “We did disclose he had been in Lake Murray,” Clarence said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen continued to fight despite the odds. "I've never witnessed anyone with the will to fight like my son, and I probably won't ever," Carr added. He refused to quit."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Health is not required by law to be notified by hospitals nor is ordered to track this particular illness. Usually, that data is reported federally to the Centers for Disease Control. There's also no testing mechanism for the amoeba, which is naturally occurring and can be found in almost any freshwater lake or river. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state already has a mechanism in place for testing our beaches,” Bailey said. “But our lakes are where the residents go, and there should not be a distinction between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said the family plans to push for legislative changes, including requiring routine testing of lakes for deadly pathogens, adding &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; to the state’s list of reportable diseases, and issuing public safety advisories when water temperatures climb above 80 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the Department of Environmental Services to begin testing immediately,” Bailey said. “The same system we have for beaches can be duplicated for our lakes.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said Jaysen’s story highlights the importance of informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say it’s rare,” Ebony Carr said. “But how rare is it when it happens to your child? That risk is too high.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said water temperature and levels are already tracked at Lake Murray. He believes those systems can also be used to issue health advisories.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A simple message like, ‘Water temperatures are high, there may be a risk of amoeba exposure—please use caution,’ could save lives,” Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen's family said he was a gifted athlete and musician, who was also involved in supporting students with special needs at his school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He played three different divisions of baseball. He was in honor band. He loved unconditionally,” said his mother, Ebony Carr. “He either loved you or just didn’t know you yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs say they are just beginning their advocacy journey. A state lawmaker, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, has expressed interest in filing legislation later this year. But the family says they want immediate action from public health and environmental agencies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we had known the risk, he wouldn’t have been in that lake,” Clarence Carr said. “We want other parents to know. We don’t want any other child to go through this.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is urging people to contact their lawmakers and agency leaders to demand changes that will protect South Carolina families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jaysen was a fighter,” Bailey said. “And now, his legacy will be a fight for something greater—safety, awareness, and change.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Jaysen Carr and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and other loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.

&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; warning of a &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego county had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 25, the county put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/"&gt;a second press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—&lt;a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf"&gt;raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC&lt;/a&gt;—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But, it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did post tweets related to the outbreak: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1717631849558913229"&gt;one on October 26, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; announced the recall; &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1730300684849795213"&gt;a second on November 30, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; noted "a recent outbreak" of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;cases from raw milk&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1732807204430921907"&gt;a third on December 7, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But, according to the final outbreak investigation report—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm"&gt;produced by CDPH and local health officials&lt;/a&gt;—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people. That report was released last week, on July 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; warning of a &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 25, the county put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/"&gt;a second press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—&lt;a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf"&gt;raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC&lt;/a&gt;—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did write social media posts related to the outbreak: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1717631849558913229"&gt;One on October 26, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; announced the recall; &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1730300684849795213"&gt;a second on November 30, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; noted "a recent outbreak" of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;cases from raw milk&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1732807204430921907"&gt;a third on December 7, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But according to the final outbreak investigation report—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm"&gt;produced by CDPH and local health officials&lt;/a&gt;—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people. That report was released last week, on July 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In late June, the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a group of independent experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/independent-assessment-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2-from-the-scientific-advisory-group-for-the-origins-of-novel-pathogens"&gt;published an assessment&lt;/a&gt; of the origins of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that although we don’t know conclusively where the virus that caused the pandemic came from: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a zoonotic origin with spillover from animals to humans is currently considered the best supported hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGO did not find scientific evidence to support “a deliberate manipulation of the virus in a laboratory and subsequent biosafety breach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows a series of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt; since the early days of the pandemic that have reached similar conclusions: COVID most likely emerged from an infected animal at the Huanan market in Wuhan, and was not the result of a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But conspiracy theories about COVID’s origins persist. And this is hampering our ability to prevent the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attacks on our research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As experts in the emergence of viruses, we published a peer-reviewed paper in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like SAGO, we evaluated several hypotheses for how a novel coronavirus could have emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. We concluded the virus very likely emerged through a natural spillover from animals – a “zoonosis” – caused by the unregulated wildlife trade in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, our paper has become a focal point of &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/12/covid-likely-came-from-a-lab-and-it-matters-enormously-to-prevent-another-pandemic/"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/investigating-the-proximal-origin-of-a-cover-up/"&gt;political attacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea SARS-CoV-2 might have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;originated in a laboratory&lt;/a&gt; is not, in itself, a conspiracy theory. Like many scientists, we &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/scientists-exactly-zero-evidence-covid-19-came-lab"&gt;considered that possibility seriously&lt;/a&gt;. And we still do, although evidence hasn’t emerged to support it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the public discourse around the origin of the pandemic has increasingly been shaped by &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;political agendas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/opinion/covid-fauci-hearings-health.html"&gt;conspiratorial narratives&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this has &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-proximal-origin-of-a-scientific-fraud/"&gt;targeted our work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/lab-leak-proponents-rutgers-accused-defaming-and-intimidating-covid-19-origin"&gt;vilified experts&lt;/a&gt; who have studied this question in a data-driven manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common conspiracy theory claims &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html"&gt;senior officials pressured us&lt;/a&gt; to promote the “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;preferred&lt;/a&gt;” hypothesis of a natural origin, while silencing the possibility of a lab leak. Some conspiracy theories even propose &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/21/covid-origin-nih-lab-leak/"&gt;we were rewarded&lt;/a&gt; with grant funding in exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/03/scicheck-no-evidence-scientists-received-grant-for-changing-opinion-on-pandemic-origins-contrary-to-claims/"&gt;narratives are false&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021133117"&gt;ignore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj0016"&gt;dismiss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;misrepresent&lt;/a&gt; the extensive body of evidence on the origin of the pandemic. Instead, they rely on selective quoting from private discussions and a distorted portrayal of the scientific process and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/12/5211/6353034"&gt;motivations of scientists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:univ47kzorwxjih3lqzrnwmv/app.bsky.feed.post/3lslxgkd72s2o"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does the evidence tell us?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the five years since our Nature Medicine paper, a substantial body of new evidence has emerged that has deepened our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 most likely emerged through a natural spillover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, the case for a zoonotic origin was already compelling. Much-discussed features of the virus &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421009910"&gt;are found in related coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; and carry signatures of natural evolution. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs of laboratory manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-billion-dollar &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/china-cracking-down-its-wildlife-trade-it-enough"&gt;wildlife trade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.actasia.org/news/actasias-fur-report-update-2022-2023/"&gt;fur farming industry&lt;/a&gt; in China regularly moves high-risk animals, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00194-5"&gt;frequently infected with viruses&lt;/a&gt;, into dense urban centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak, emerged this way in 2002 in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673603146302/fulltext"&gt;China’s Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, detailed analyses of epidemiological data show the earliest known COVID cases &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;clustered around&lt;/a&gt; the Huanan live-animal market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON229"&gt;in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple independent data sources, including early &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4454"&gt;hospitalisations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00991-0"&gt;excess pneumonia deaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666606521000031"&gt;antibody studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000463"&gt;infections among health-care workers&lt;/a&gt; indicate COVID first spread in the district where the market is located. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; we and other experts showed that environmental samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 clustered in the section of the market where wildlife was sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00901-2"&gt;2024 follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; we demonstrated those same samples contained genetic material from susceptible animals – including raccoon dogs and civets – on cages, carts, and other surfaces used to hold and transport them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prove infected animals were the source. But it’s precisely what we would expect if the market was where the virus first spilled over. And it’s contrary to what would be expected from a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and all &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337"&gt;other independent lines of evidence&lt;/a&gt; point to the Huanan market as the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8384"&gt;early epicentre&lt;/a&gt; of the COVID pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Hindering preparedness for the next pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation and conspiracy theories around the origin of COVID have &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00089-23"&gt;undermined trust in science&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance"&gt;false balance&lt;/a&gt; between lab leak and zoonotic origin theories assigned by some commentators has added fuel to the conspiracy fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02981-z"&gt;anti-science agenda&lt;/a&gt;, stemming in part &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2023-00032"&gt;from COVID origin conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;, is being used to help justify deep cuts to funding for biomedical research, public health and global aid. These areas are essential for pandemic preparedness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States this has meant major cuts to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/hhs-mass-firings"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01397-1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the closure of the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o"&gt;US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2501790"&gt;withdrawal from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/111/1/article-p216.xml"&gt;Undermining trust in science&lt;/a&gt; and public health institutions also hinders the development and uptake of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio"&gt;life-saving vaccines and other medical interventions&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves us more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amplification of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID has promoted a dangerously flawed understanding of pandemic risk. The idea that a researcher discovered or engineered a pandemic virus, accidentally infected themselves, and unknowingly sparked a global outbreak (in exactly the type of setting where natural spillovers are known to occur) defies logic. It also detracts from the significant risk posed by the wildlife trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;evidence-based conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID pandemic most likely began with a virus jumping from animals to humans highlights the very real risk we increasingly face. This is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn2222"&gt;how pandemics start&lt;/a&gt;, and it will happen again. But we’re dismantling our ability to stop it or prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/brain-eating-amoeba-in-the-us/507-04e63a4b-7d0e-4a6c-92f3-5e17d70012ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;he was dead from an amoeba&lt;/a&gt; that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His parents had no clue the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn't closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn’t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can't believe we don't have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else," Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child's heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;The best Fourth of July ever&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He either loved you or he just didn't know you,” his father said. “He was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, ‘This is my friend James.’”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends invited Jaysen and his family for the Fourth of July holiday weekend on the lake, where Jaysen spent hours swimming, fishing and riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a boat.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mom and Dad, that was the best Fourth of July I’ve ever had,” Clarence Carr remembered his son telling him.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;A headache suddenly gets worse&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Jaysen's head started to hurt. Pain relievers helped. But the next day the headache got worse and he started throwing up. He told the emergency room doctors exactly where he was hurting. But soon he started to get disoriented and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is fairly common. Researchers are still trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The amoeba is found in warm water and the infection is almost always fatal&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba becomes dangerous in very warm water and for years has been seen almost exclusively in the summer in the southern part of the country. But a few &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535447/"&gt;recent cases&lt;/a&gt; have popped up in Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said 167 cases of the infection have been reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, and only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys seem most susceptible, but researchers don't know if that is simply because they are more likely to jump and dive into the water or play in sediment at the bottom of lakes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That's why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Parents want others to know the danger from the brain-eating amoeba&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he sat in an intensive care hospital room with his son, Clarence Carr couldn't help but think of all the people on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wondered if any of them had any clue about the microscopic danger in that water.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are entire families out there on pontoon boats, jumping off, just like our kids were having the time of their lives,” he said. “It very well could be their last moments, and they are unaware of it.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

There was a time in my 20s when I worked out consistently. I took a mix of fitness classes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;boxing, cardio dance, HIIT&lt;/a&gt; and even bootcamps, when I was feeling really ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3eddd" class="body-graf"&gt;When the pandemic hit and everything shut down, I kept &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/10-tips-virtual-fitness-classes-during-covid-19-t192823" target="_blank"&gt;working out through virtual classes&lt;/a&gt; to try to cling to some sense of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e3c54" class="body-graf"&gt;Once the world opened back up, I fell off. My job remained remote, so I had no real reason to leave my apartment. I tried to return to the classes I’d loved, but so many studios had closed down, and the remaining ones were no longer convenient for me without an office nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c339cf" class="body-graf"&gt;These days, the most exercise I get is walking from my bed to my couch to my “office” inside my 700-square-foot apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e7e89" class="body-graf"&gt;My lack of daily movement had started to take its toll. In addition to gaining weight, I had &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/7-expert-backed-ways-boost-energy-rcna22995" target="_blank"&gt;no energy&lt;/a&gt;, struggled to fall asleep, and had body aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-949a95" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m only 37. I’m too young to feel this old.  I knew I had to do &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;to get more movement into my daily routine. My social media algorithm must have sensed this, relentlessly serving me video after video of fitness influencers out on their hot girl walks, trying to get their steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddf34e" class="body-graf"&gt;Could &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/national-walking-day-rcna77959" target="_blank"&gt;walking an hour every day&lt;/a&gt; really do anything substantial for my health? &lt;a href="https://stepitupwithsteph.com/"&gt;Stephanie Mansour&lt;/a&gt;, Start TODAY trainer and TODAY fitness contributor, assured me it could. “&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;Regular walking&lt;/a&gt; can significantly contribute to weight loss by burning calories and boosting your metabolism,” she explained. According to Mansour, walking can also improve cardiovascular health by strengthening your heart, lowering your blood pressure, and reducing the risk of heart disease. My blood pressure was borderline high at my last physical, so this got my attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-528681" class="body-graf"&gt;I’d also been having chronic back and shoulder pain, which, you guessed it, can see improvement from simply walking more. “Daily walks create muscle endurance, strengthen bones, and improve joint health, making it a fantastic low-impact exercise option,” Mansour says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-6e18ba"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg" alt="Danielle Page before and after."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Danielle Page added a 1-hour walk to her daily routine and lost 5 pounds in a month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Danielle Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0692e5" class="body-graf"&gt;Committing to a non-negotiable walk for an hour a day seemed like the lowest-effort way to motivate myself to move more, so I decided to give it a try. Here’s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9b0cff" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f832b" class="body-graf"&gt;On day one, I weighed in at 149 pounds. This is the most weight I’ve ever carried on my 5’2” frame, and it was shocking to see. I took my measurements, laced up my sneakers and braced myself for an hour of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-abf0dd" class="body-graf"&gt;I was surprised at how tired I became almost immediately — the minutes dragged by. I attempted to pass the time by calling my mom to catch up. By the end of the call, I thought I’d knocked out at least half an hour of my walk. I was shocked to see only 13 minutes had gone by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a5a59" class="body-graf"&gt;The next day, the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/doms-sore-muscles-after-workout-rcna42188" target="_blank"&gt;backs of my legs were sore,&lt;/a&gt; and I wasn’t looking forward to this walk at all. I decided to break it up into half-hour increments, which were easier to complete separately, but made me dread that last half hour for the rest of the day. It was so tempting to skip it. Halfway through week one, I decided that breaking my walk in two was dragging things out and went back to a full hour. To keep myself motivated, I found destinations to walk to that I had wanted to visit. Some days, it was making it down to the park, about a half-hour walk from me each way. Most days, it was a cute coffee shop or lunch spot I’d wanted to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-704523" class="body-graf"&gt;By the end of week one, I had accepted that walking for an hour was now a permanent part of my daily routine, but never looked forward to it. I did notice I was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/sleep/3-2-1-sleep-rule-rcna172261" target="_blank"&gt;sleeping a bit better&lt;/a&gt; than I normally do. Each day, I knocked my walk out first thing, which gave me a more consistent morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-daabc7" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Struggling to start your own walking routine? Ease into it with this &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;7-Day Audio Walking Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for a daily motivational podcast to help you get your steps in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b4ad50" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d65d9a" class="body-graf"&gt;Walking wasn't quite as painful during week two, and most days I was able to knock it out &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;with a podcast&lt;/a&gt; and forego getting myself a little treat (though it was hard to resist). I felt my stamina improve toward the end of this week, and I noticed I got slightly &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-steps-vs-minutes-vs-miles-rcna213522" target="_blank"&gt;farther on my walks&lt;/a&gt; in the same amount of time as I had during the previous week. At first, I struggled to get my walks over the two-mile mark, but by the end of week two, I was hitting 2.5 miles without much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dacbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Everything was going well until a heat wave hit my city. Up until this point, I’d been walking outdoors, but several days during week two hit almost 100 degrees, so I had to find an alternative. I dusted off my barely used gym membership to complete my hour-long &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hiit-treadmill-workouts-rcna121189" target="_blank"&gt;walks on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; for a few days while I waited for things to cool off. It took the pressure off of figuring out what route I’d take, but by the third day of this, I was pretty bored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8598ba" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For days when the weather doesn't cooperate, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;try a fun Indoor Walking Routine with Al Roker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-447db1" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-628d49" class="body-graf"&gt;During week three, I went to visit family in Long Island. Thanks to the change in scenery, this was probably the only time I really enjoyed walking for an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4548" class="body-graf"&gt;“Variety can keep things interesting and prevent burnout,” says Mansour, who encouraged me to change my routine to challenge different muscles and avoid boredom. So I committed to trying a new path every day to give my mind something new to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-335de8" class="body-graf"&gt;Walking was finally part of my routine. I’d wake up around the same time each morning, get my walk out of the way, have breakfast and log on to start working for the day. During week three, I noticed a shift in my energy levels and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/happy-foods-rcna206268" target="_blank"&gt;overall mood&lt;/a&gt;. I felt more focused at work and more invigorated overall. Also, I slept like a baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-685afb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Beyond the physical changes, walking delivers impressive &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/non-scale-victories-nsv-rcna98828" target="_blank"&gt;non-scale victories&lt;/a&gt; (NSV),” Mansour explains. “Many people experience a noticeable boost in energy levels and better sleep quality,” Mansour said. Walking is also a great mood enhancer, releasing endorphins that&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/1-breathing-technique-anxiety-smorning-routine-rcna181347" target="_blank"&gt; combat stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, making you happier and more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39fefc" class="body-graf"&gt;By this point in my experiment, I’d built decent stamina walking. That is, until I tried to walk on the beach. The resistance of the sand and slope of the shore had my calves burning within the first few minutes of walking. At what I thought had to be the halfway point, I looked down at my phone to find that I’d been walking for a whopping seven minutes. I felt defeated, but persevered, breaking that walk into half-hour intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-eb9e18" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac4b2" class="body-graf"&gt;By week four, I was over this walking experiment. The benefits you read about really are there. But I wanted my lazy mornings back in the worst way. Every morning, I had to convince myself not to quit or skip a day here and there. On the flip side, I was in a great mood every morning when I came back from my walk. I was happy that I’d gone. I was walking much more easily and my speed was noticeably faster. During week 4, I hit three miles for the first time. I reminded my pre-walk self about that post-walk feeling every day during this week. The day after I completed my one-month experiment, I spent the entire day sitting on my couch watching movies with my cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-3b110f"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg" alt="Danielle Page before and after."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Page lost a few pounds and inches, but it was the non-scale victories that she was most surprised to feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Danielle Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-103030" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Result: 5 Pounds Down and Mood Way Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72600a" class="body-graf"&gt;I waited until the end of the experiment to weigh myself again, out of fear that I hadn’t lost any weight. When I weighed in, I was shocked to see the scale read 144.6. I’d also lost an inch off my chest and an inch off my thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7381e" class="body-graf"&gt;The weight loss was nice, but it wasn’t the best part of this experiment — it was feeling so much better overall. There’s unfortunately no magic pill to get better sleep, mood, energy and focus — but walking an hour a day is a pretty low lift way to achieve these things. Something I’ve been trying to remember post-experiment when I don’t feel like going on another walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPVERDd2hoWHpOa1N6MDZqS3lUclVTRGkxWWVobzJPYW12OWpRSjRaQkI0Ny15NFpzRHJMVjFWbnhyczNncWxkMmhsUXFwQXBZTVdnQ2pKdDJocnYzdlJ3aVQ1OE5YUm1iYVBhX3NudjY0SVh0X1IwVkxkMl9hYUIzUmJhY0tkMWM3RC1fX010NFlmNGRSaDhIbG5uTdIBVEFVX3lxTE56SFo5cmlDMzRYQkp3Z2xINGtXVFowQ3dzbnhxQVZIUV9CRnVHRV9iTXRSTG5pMF9UVURkRGtQSlhhYWtaNk44c21IUkh3Y3ktT1Jqcg</guid></item><item><title>拒绝化疗后死亡的女性每日咖啡灌肠- BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9vdWZ3SkNCQ2FBNERQbmhkYzJrUDdwbFdGSXhEZE95WXhjOFFFUlZxaUUzSTNtSGxSZ19YY2x3S0FNU1lZNVJ2Z25WYjE0eG52S0Fyd0UwaXQ4UdIBX0FVX3lxTE5iR21VOFdGa0xpWUI5ejdyLWZFbEwzb195dFJGSGxhSFltRVh3Ymt6RVV2dGlRZ05ZcHJJQTA1bno2eVN3bXhwZnpxalRSZFQwdUQ4NGNid2lTek9hbW5r?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Woman who refused chemo and died had coffee enemas&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Nathan Bevan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, South East&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Gabriel &amp;amp; Sebastian Shemirani Paloma, pictured in what looks like a flash photo from a film camera, with her face brightly lit smiling in the centre of the frame, her hair in long blond curls, wearing a coat with a furry hood and with something in leopard print faux-fur around her shoulders.

While it doesn’t imply that people with psychiatric diagnoses are more prone to hate, the overlap suggests that online hate speech may cultivate traits like low empathy and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts from communities for personality disorders had the most linguistic similarity to hate speech groups. These findings may inform future interventions by adapting therapeutic strategies typically used for managing such disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech Overlap:&lt;/strong&gt; Hate speech communities shared linguistic traits with Cluster B personality disorder communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Diagnostic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The study does not claim individuals with mental illness are more hateful—only that language patterns are similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could guide new strategies for countering hate speech using mental health approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new analysis suggests that posts in hate speech communities on the social media website Reddit share speech-pattern similarities with posts in Reddit communities for certain psychiatric disorders. Dr. Andrew William Alexander and Dr. Hongbin Wang of Texas A&amp;amp;M University, U.S., present these findings July 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of social media has raised concerns about its role in spreading hate speech and misinformation, potentially contributing to prejudice, discrimination and real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112000"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and online forum chat bubbles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has uncovered associations between certain personality traits and the act of posting online hate speech or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether any associations exist between psychological wellbeing and online hate speech or misinformation has been unclear. To help clarify, Alexander and Wang used artificial intelligence tools to analyze posts from 54 Reddit communities relevant to hate speech, misinformation, psychiatric disorders, or, for neutral comparison, none of those categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selected groups included r/ADHD, a community for discussing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, r/NoNewNormal, dedicated to COVID-19 misinformation, and r/Incels, a community banned for hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the large-language model GPT3 to convert thousands of posts from these communities into numerical representations capturing the posts’ underlying speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representations, or “embeddings,” could then be analyzed through machine-learning techniques and a mathematical approach known as topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis showed that speech patterns in hate speech communities were similar to speech patterns in communities for complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline, narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders. Links between misinformation and psychiatric disorders were less clear, but with some connections to anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these findings do not at all suggest that people with psychiatric disorders are more prone to hate speech or misinformation. For one, there was no way of knowing if the analyzed posts were made by people actually diagnosed with disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the links and explore such possibilities as hate speech communities mimicking speech patterns seen in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our results show that the speech patterns of those participating in hate speech online have strong underlying similarities with those participating in communities for individuals with certain psychiatric disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chief among these are the Cluster B personality disorders: Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. These disorders are generally known for either lack of empathy/regard towards the wellbeing of others, or difficulties managing anger and relationships with others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander notes, “While we looked for similarities between misinformation and psychiatric disorder speech patterns as well, the connections we found were far weaker. Besides a potential anxiety component, I think it is safe to say at this point in time that most people buying into or spreading misinformation are actually quite healthy from a psychiatric standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander concludes, “I want to emphasize that these results do not mean that individuals with psychiatric conditions are more likely to engage in hate speech. Instead, it suggests that people who engage in hate speech online tend to have similar speech patterns to those with cluster B personality disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that the lack of empathy for others fostered by hate speech influences people over time and causes them to exhibit traits similar to those seen in Cluster B personality disorders, at least with regards to the target of their hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While further studies would be needed to confirm this, I think it is a good indicator that exposing ourselves to these types of communities for long periods of time is not healthy and can make us less empathetic towards others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;AWA was a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Scholar supported by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Physician Scientist Institutional Award (G-1020069) to the Texas A&amp;amp;M University Academy of Physician Scientists (https://www.bwfund.org/funding-opportunities/biomedical-sciences/physician-scientist-institutional-award/grant-recipients/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In this study, we collected thousands of posts from carefully selected communities on the social media site Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then utilized OpenAI’s GPT3 to derive embeddings of these posts, which are high-dimensional real-numbered vectors that presumably represent the hidden semantics of posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed various machine-learning classifications based on these embeddings in order to identify potential similarities between hate speech/misinformation speech patterns and those of various communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a topological data analysis (TDA) was applied to the embeddings to obtain a visual map connecting online hate speech, misinformation, various psychiatric disorders, and general mental health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:41:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOUF9zeGkzaE5CX0VyR0ZxbU80aTNJalMwR0VOd3BPdnNsc2VwckRTNHVFYUM2SWExdjdvVFhXeHd0cUFpZ1B4OUZSd2t3bkpSdHllc0lKQmFpMTJKWmU4NFRzQ3pCY2RLeUVoRG52c0dVc3lUb1pSQVc4Tk1RQjlJQw</guid></item><item><title>1亿美国人服用的最常见的止痛药可能会使您更容易作弊和吸毒-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The world’s most popular pain reliever may cause people to take more risks and reduce fear around risky decisions, leading to bolder behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen, known around the world as paracetamol, weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;have been investigating&lt;/a&gt; how it might influence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;people's behavior&lt;/a&gt; on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure the effects of acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol -researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-e57f0750-6c7b-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; State University had over 500 college students participate in a risk-taking game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some participants received a normal dose of acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, mirroring standard over-the-counter use, while others received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the game, they inflated a virtual balloon to earn cash rewards. If it burst, they lost everything. The acetaminophen group pumped more aggressively and popped more balloons, suggesting they cared less about the risk of losing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In follow-up surveys, those on acetaminophen rated activities like bungee jumping or gambling as less risky than the placebo group, but only when the scenarios were emotionally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that while the changes in risk-taking are subtle, they’re worth watching, mainly because acetaminophen is found in over 600 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is the active pain reliever in Tylenol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggested that acetaminophen’s effect on risk-taking behavior likely goes beyond just dulling fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The over-the-counter drug may also alter deeper cognitive and neurological processes, including by turning off the brain’s alarm signals for danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may also reduce awareness of one’s mistakes, and quiet a part of the brain that gives someone a gut feeling that danger is close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Baldwin Way, co-author of the 2020 study and associate professor of psychology at Ohio State University, said: ‘Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don’t feel as scared.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way conducted three experiments in his report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/15/7/725/5897711?login=false"&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across these studies, 545 undergraduate students took part in a task developed in 2002 that is often used by researchers to measure risk-taking behavior: inflating a balloon in exchange for cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can stop at any time, bank the money, and move on to the next balloon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The people who took acetaminophen pumped more and more, despite the risk of the balloon popping and losing all their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the balloon-popping game, people who took acetaminophen pumped 32 times compared to 29 times in the placebo group, and had more bursts, with 8.5 in the acetaminophen group compared to 7.9 in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol - weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above compares results of people who took acetaminophen versus those who were given the placebo in risk-taking games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way said: ‘If you’re risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don’t want the balloon to burst and lose your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research by Dr Way on the effects of acetaminophen on people’s behavior has suggested that it dulls positive and negative emotions, including hurt feelings, distress over another person’s suffering, and their joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He posited in his latest research that the medicine reduces anticipatory anxiety. Typically, as the balloon expands, people feel growing anxiety about it bursting, making them stop pumping earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug may blunt this nervous feeling, though, causing people to take more risks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Way, ‘increased risk-taking could have important effects on society.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a dampened feeling of fear, anxiety and negative emotions, people may be more likely to partake in risky behavior, including cheating on partners, drinking excessively and taking drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Gut Bacteria May Hold the Key to Multiple Sclerosis—But Don't Get Too Excited Yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a million Americans wake up each day with multiple sclerosis, a disease that turns their own immune system against their brain and spinal cord. For decades, researchers have suspected that something in the gut might trigger this autoimmune assault. Now, a clever twin study has fingered two specific bacterial culprits: &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank"&gt;published in PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, used 81 pairs of identical twins where only one sibling had MS. It's an elegant approach—same genes, different outcomes. The German-led team found these two bacteria lurking in higher numbers in the small intestines of the twins with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets interesting. They didn't stop at correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Gut to Brain: The Mouse Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers transplanted gut bacteria from the twins into specially bred mice prone to MS-like disease. The results were stark: mice getting bacteria from MS twins developed paralysis within twelve weeks. Those getting microbes from healthy twins stayed mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female mice were hit harder—matching the real-world pattern where &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;women are three times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop MS than men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; belong to the Lachnospiraceae family, typically harmless fiber-digesters. What makes these two troublemakers different isn't clear yet, but they can feast on mucus when fiber runs low—potentially thinning the intestinal barrier and exposing immune cells to inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bigger Picture: MS by the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects &lt;a href="https://atlasofms.org/" target="_blank"&gt;2.9 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;nearly one million in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. It typically strikes in the prime of life—average diagnosis age is 32—when people are building careers and starting families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is unpredictable. About 85% start with relapsing-remitting MS, where symptoms flare and fade. Without treatment, roughly half progress to secondary progressive MS within a decade, where disability steadily accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current treatments can slow progression but can't cure the disease or reverse damage. That's why finding specific bacterial triggers matters—it offers a concrete target instead of trying to re-engineer the entire gut ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality Check: Breakthrough or False Dawn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have linked gut bacteria to MS. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28893994/" target="_blank"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; found similar patterns with different bacterial players. The field is littered with promising leads that didn't pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several red flags warrant caution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mouse problem&lt;/strong&gt;: MS-like disease in mice isn't MS in humans. Countless therapies that worked in rodents have failed in clinical trials. The immune systems are different, the gut environments are different, and lab mice live in sterile bubbles unlike the microbial chaos of human guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample size&lt;/strong&gt;: 81 twin pairs sounds impressive, but it's still relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about a complex disease affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causation vs. correlation&lt;/strong&gt;: Even with the mouse experiments, we can't be certain these bacteria &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; MS rather than simply thriving in the inflammatory environment MS creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replication challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Independent teams need to confirm these findings in different populations. Science is littered with exciting results that couldn't be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this research holds up, the therapeutic possibilities are intriguing. Targeted antibiotics, designer bacteriophages, or engineered probiotics could potentially eliminate the troublesome bacteria while leaving beneficial microbes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early trials of high-fiber diets have shown modest benefits in MS patients—possibly by keeping mucus-eating bacteria occupied with safer food sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any gut-targeted therapy will need to navigate the complex ecosystem of beneficial bacteria that support vitamin synthesis and immune regulation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics sometimes worsen autoimmune diseases, highlighting the delicate balance involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This twin study represents solid, methodical science. The researchers controlled for genetics, used functional testing in mice, and identified specific bacterial species rather than vague "microbiome imbalances."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's one study, using mouse models, with a modest sample size. The history of MS research is filled with promising leads that ultimately led nowhere. Remember when researchers were convinced MS was caused by a virus? Or when they thought it was purely genetic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart money says this research will spawn follow-up studies, some confirming the findings, others contradicting them. That's how science works—messy, incremental, often disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the million Americans living with MS, this offers hope for new treatment approaches. But it's not a breakthrough yet—it's a promising lead that needs years of additional research to prove its worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain connection in autoimmune disease is real. Whether these two bacterial species are key players or bit characters in a much larger drama remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hancock County resident has been hospitalized with the first human case of Powassan virus infection recorded by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention this year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The adult was experiencing neurologic symptoms, according to the Maine CDC. The Powassan virus is spread through deer or woodchuck tick bites, and can infect a bitten person in just 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people who contract Powassan virus do not show any symptoms, while others may experience a fever and flu-like illness. More severe symptoms include seizures, memory loss or brain or spinal cord inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information on Powassan virus, including prevention and detection, visit the Maine CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/powassan/index.shtml"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/powassan/index.shtml"&gt;Powassan virus website&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the &lt;a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/"&gt;UMaine Tick Lab&lt;/a&gt; for more information about tick identification and testing.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The Maine CDC said Tuesday that it had also recorded its first known case of a West Nile virus infection in a wild bird. The crow infected with the virus was discovered in York County. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The development and symptoms of West Nile are similar to those of the Powassan virus infection, and more information can be found at the &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/news/maine-cdc-prepares-active-mosquito-season-mon-06302025-1200"&gt;Maine CDC website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid contracting a viral infection is to prevent tick and mosquito bites. This includes wearing long sleeves and high socks when working outdoors; tucking your pant legs into your socks; use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, or another &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/gotpests/bugs/mosquito.htm#:~:text=Information%20on%20Insect%20Repellents"&gt;EPA-approved repellent&lt;/a&gt;; check for ticks in areas including your armpits, the back of your knees and your crotch after being outside; and draining any standing bodies of water, such as bird baths or splash pools, that could serve as mosquito breeding grounds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year Maine saw a &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/01/02/homestead/maine-tick-borne-disease-record-2024/"&gt;record number&lt;/a&gt; of tickborne diseases with &lt;a href="https://data.mainepublichealth.gov/tracking/tickborne"&gt;3,218 cases&lt;/a&gt; of Lyme disease reported between January and December, along with a rise in other lesser-known diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

These conditions included Parkinson's disease, age-related frailty, gangrene, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Poor sleep could put people at greater risk of 172 diseases ranging from gangrene to dementia, a groundbreaking new study suggests (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 122 diseases had at least 1.5-fold risk, including type 2 diabetes, respiratory failure, bone and spine fractures and urinary incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the 172 diseases found to be associated with sleep, up to 52 percent of the risk of a single disease could be attributed to a sleep trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-two diseases had over a 20 percent risk attributable to at least one sleep trait, and 44 diseases had one attributable risk over 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some common diseases showed considerable attributable risk, such as Parkinson's disease (37 percent by caused by inconsistent sleeping patterns) and urinary incontinence (24 percent by how much time you spend asleep while in bed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, the study challenges previous claims that 'long sleep' (more than nine hours) is harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While subjective reports have linked long sleep to stroke and heart disease, objective data in the most recent study revealed this association only with heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Misclassification may be to blame, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just over 21 percent of 'long sleepers' actually slept less than six hours, suggesting that time spent in bed is often confused with actual sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recommended guidelines suggest seven to nine hours is the ideal sleep time for adults.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Among the 172 diseases found to be associated with sleep, up to 52.29 percent of the risk of a single disease could be attributed to a sleep trait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings underscore the overlooked importance of sleep regularity,' said Prof. Shengfeng Wang, senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's time we broaden our definition of good sleep beyond just duration.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers want to look at the impact of sleep treatment plans on chronic disease outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Chris Winter, a neurologist specializing in sleep, previously told DailyMail.com the link between poor sleep and health issues are ‘probably multi-factorial.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that sleeping too little causes the nervous system to malfunction, leading to a higher heart rate, high blood pressure, and elevated stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep can also exacerbate inflammation in the body, a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia, and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight and metabolism are also impacted when a person sleeps too poorly, as diet tends to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep's effects on hormones mean people are likely to make unhealthier food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Beth Frates, director of lifestyle medicine and wellness in the Department of Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ‘Most people focus on exercise and diet when it comes to weight management and a healthy heart, but few focus on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 100 diseases had at least 1.5-fold risk associated with certain sleep traits, including type 2 diabetes, respiratory failure, bone and spine fractures and urinary incontinence (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Working to find ways to clean up sleep hygiene may help people to extend sleep time to the recommended seven to nine hours per night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could, in turn, lead to consuming fewer calories and even weight loss in people who are in the overweight category by BMI.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another study examining the risk to heart health published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers found that middle-aged adults with conditions like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or stroke may face a higher risk of cancer and premature death if they sleep less than six hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is known that the effects of poor sleep can be felt immediately, and after around three days of too little sleep, a person can develop hallucinations or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also lead to an increased risk of death by accident or injury. Almost 20 percent of all serious car crash injuries among the general public are associated with driver sleepiness, independent of alcohol effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to drivers who had slept for a regular seven hours, those who reported they’d slept fewer were 1.3 times more likely to crash, while those who slept five to six hours were nearly two times as likely to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And sleep four to five hours quadrupled a person’s risk of being in a serious crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNcXBPNjNJZ1NiWER4ejRqakMxOGJ1RjVTN1JJUnYzem55SjFoOWpLeFhsM1FBQzNtR29LN0REUnJGYXVXWDFrWW9oTHFiSkFEc2FaNkZGeWFEblpkN1pYTVVzMTlOWVFoLUIxMFNKN1hZLUhjRXBKLU9wNkIwTUh6RjlhUExLQlU0SURlalJLcklMRDREdFNTdG5STHDSAaIBQVVfeXFMUDJ6akRSU3NQampybFdtSWMtYV9oQkI1VVBLbTBidG5RNjZ4Ty1kbjA0OVRnaVFnSGV1eFNEM2xhRDdZSEpoWjlnclhKYlBXWWtVMDlRRkVQN3BLMlhkc1ZUNDRNWDZhcE9oNVo3bHRDLXFMWW0wQjVqS2dUOHptS1oxVi1JaTU5TW9aTmg4V0ZhZVExM3h5VHhvYVF2SzhZQVRn</guid></item><item><title>关于致命的大脑吞噬变形虫的知识- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOeE5ac0RHSmQtcGt2ajBXMUVNYV8zMFJfRUVOZVZ3Yjc2cERmeUNYSkl4OWRHaEFrcXU2RFh0VzhyNWM2Z2l6TW1JRVFJR2NWTy1JMU1Da3VqcUxLdkN5MnNxWC14MkZtVGFaTWVTZ3RQNlZFVkVQUlo5dVpzZ0NfS3N2WUZnZ3paSzNyaTR3M0VaYm12eXE5aDRYcG5mOHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. -- &lt;/span&gt;A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/brain-eating-amoeba-death-south-carolina-lake-f61a5f97384fed3c366508382be94d45"&gt;popular South Carolina lake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue.

Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/e-coli/symptoms-causes/syc-20372058"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Algae can also cause illnesses.

            &lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina’s most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy’s parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn’t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe we don’t have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,” Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child’s heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Fourth of July ever&lt;br&gt;
Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He either loved you or he just didn’t know you,” his father said. “He was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, ‘This is my friend James.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends invited Jaysen and his family for the Fourth of July holiday weekend on the lake, where Jaysen spent hours swimming, fishing and riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mom and Dad, that was the best Fourth of July I’ve ever had,” Clarence Carr remembered his son telling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A headache suddenly gets worse&lt;br&gt;
A few days later, Jaysen’s head started to hurt. Pain relievers helped. But the next day the headache got worse and he started throwing up. He told the emergency room doctors exactly where he was hurting. But soon he started to get disoriented and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is fairly common. Researchers are still trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is found in warm water and the infection is almost always fatal&lt;br&gt;
The amoeba becomes dangerous in very warm water and for years has been seen almost exclusively in the summer in the southern part of the country. But a few recent cases have popped up in Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said 167 cases of the infection have been reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, and only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys seem most susceptible, but researchers don’t know if that is simply because they are more likely to jump and dive into the water or play in sediment at the bottom of lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want others to know the danger from the brain-eating amoeba&lt;br&gt;
As he sat in an intensive care hospital room with his son, Clarence Carr couldn’t help but think of all the people on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wondered if any of them had any clue about the microscopic danger in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are entire families out there on pontoon boats, jumping off, just like our kids were having the time of their lives,” he said. “It very well could be their last moments, and they are unaware of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast walking for just 15 minutes a day was linked to a nearly 20% reduction in death risk in a major long-term study.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The research focused on low-income and Black adults, a population often underrepresented in health studies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Speed mattered more than duration: slow walking for hours offered far fewer benefits than short bouts of brisk walking.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Findings suggest a simple, low-cost way to improve health and reduce disparities—no gym or fancy equipment required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASHVILLE —&lt;/strong&gt; If you like going on walks regularly, you’ll love this study. Scientists tracking nearly 85,000 Americans for almost two decades say that as little as 15 minutes of brisk walking each day was linked to a nearly 20% lower risk of dying from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, stands out because of who participated. Unlike most &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise studies&lt;/a&gt; that focus on middle-class White Americans, this one tracked predominantly low-income Black adults across 12 southeastern states. It’s a population that faces higher rates of chronic disease and death but has been largely overlooked in health research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center report that even modest amounts of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fast-paced walking &lt;/a&gt;could make a meaningful difference in communities where gym memberships, personal trainers, and fancy fitness equipment often aren’t realistic options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fast walking &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-faster-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;as little as 15 minutes a day&lt;/a&gt; was associated with a nearly 20% reduction in total mortality,” the researchers wrote, while “only a 4% reduction in mortality was found in association with more than three hours of daily slow walking.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-study-that-mirrors-real-america"&gt;A Study That Mirrors Real America&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors followed 79,856 adults aged 40 to 79 from 2002 to 2022, with most participants recruited through community health centers serving low-income populations. About two-thirds were Black, and more than half reported annual household incomes below $15,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the median follow-up period of 16.7 years, 26,862 participants died. But those who walked briskly for just 15 minutes daily had markedly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7000-daily-steps-lower-death-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower death rates&lt;/a&gt; than those who didn’t walk fast at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most previous studies on walking and health have focused on wealthier, whiter populations, leaving major gaps in understanding how physical activity affects the health of America’s most vulnerable communities. Black Americans have higher rates of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/early-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;, yet have been underrepresented in studies that could guide public health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study defined “fast walking” as activities like climbing stairs, brisk walking, or exercising; essentially any walking that gets the heart pumping a bit faster. “Slow walking” included moving around the house, walking at work, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/everyday-movements-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;walking the dog&lt;/a&gt; at a leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Simply heading outside and picking up a brisk pace for at least 15 minutes every day could be the secret to a longer, healthier life. (© Iona – stock.adobe.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speed-matters-more-than-duration"&gt;Speed Matters More Than Duration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dramatic difference between fast and slow walking proved to be the study’s most striking discovery. While people who walked slowly for more than three hours daily saw only a modest 4% reduction in death risk, those who managed just 15 minutes of brisk walking saw benefits five times greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the study participants reported doing no fast walking at all in their daily routines, while about one-third engaged in slow walking for more than three hours daily. Many people are already moving throughout their days, but may not be moving with enough intensity to maximize health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brisk-walking-fatty-liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protective effects&lt;/a&gt; appeared regardless of participants’ starting health status. People with existing conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease saw even larger reductions in death risk from fast walking than their healthier counterparts, though everyone benefited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of fast walking were independent of other forms of exercise, meaning people saw improvements even if they weren’t doing additional activities like sports or gym workouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-shows-the-biggest-improvements"&gt;Heart Disease Shows the Biggest Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protective effects were strongest against cardiovascular disease, which kills more Americans than any other cause. Participants who engaged in fast walking experienced large reductions in heart disease deaths, with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-at-this-speed-lowers-heart-rhythm-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the benefits&lt;/a&gt; appearing even with short durations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking increases heart rate and oxygen delivery to muscles, strengthening the cardiovascular system over time. It also helps control weight and blood pressure while reducing inflammation, which are all factors that contribute to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longer, healthier lives.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that heart disease disproportionately affects Black Americans and those with lower incomes, the same populations that made up most of this study. These communities often face barriers to traditional forms of exercise, from unsafe neighborhoods to limited access to recreational facilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-simple-solution-for-complex-health-problems"&gt;A Simple Solution for Complex Health Problems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For public health officials trying to reduce health disparities, the research offers a remarkably accessible intervention. Brisk walking requires no special equipment, gym membership, or training. It can be done almost anywhere, at any time, and costs nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 15-minute threshold is particularly encouraging &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/15-minutes-exercise-helps-brain-retain-new-motor-skills-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;because it fits easily&lt;/a&gt; into most daily routines. That’s less time than many people spend scrolling social media or waiting in line at coffee shops. It could be as simple as walking briskly to the bus stop, taking the stairs instead of elevators, or doing a quick loop around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers acknowledged that even brisk walking can be challenging in communities that lack safe sidewalks, well-lit streets, or parks. Environmental factors like air pollution and neighborhood safety concerns can create real barriers to outdoor physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study had several important limitations. Participants self-reported their walking habits just once at the beginning of the study, so researchers couldn’t track how activity levels changed over time. Results also couldn’t prove that walking directly caused the lower death rates, only that the two were strongly associated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the message is clear: health benefits don’t require marathon training or expensive fitness programs. For millions of Americans, particularly those in communities hardest hit by chronic disease, 15 minutes of brisk &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;walking daily&lt;/a&gt; could be a literal lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, which enrolled approximately 85,000 participants aged 40-79 between 2002-2009 across 12 southeastern U.S. states. Most participants (86%) were recruited through community health centers serving low-income populations, with the remainder selected through random sampling. About two-thirds of participants were Black, and more than half reported annual household incomes below $15,000. Participants completed baseline questionnaires about their daily walking habits, demographic information, lifestyle factors, and health status. The researchers tracked deaths through December 31, 2022, using the National Death Index. They excluded participants who died within the first two years and those with missing walking data, leaving 79,856 people in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over a median follow-up of 16.7 years, 26,862 deaths occurred. Fast walking showed strong associations with reduced mortality, while slow walking showed minimal benefits. Participants who walked fast for as little as 15 minutes daily had a 19% lower risk of death (hazard ratio: 0.81) compared to those who didn’t walk fast. In contrast, people who walked slowly for more than three hours daily had only a 4% lower death risk. The benefits were strongest for cardiovascular disease deaths, followed by other diseases, cancers, and external causes. Fast walking provided additional benefits even for people who were already physically active through other leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on self-reported walking data collected only at baseline, so researchers couldn’t track changes in activity levels over time. Some participants may have included other activities like stair climbing when reporting fast walking, potentially affecting accuracy. The observational design means the study shows association, not causation. Researchers couldn’t completely rule out reverse causation or unmeasured confounding factors. The study also didn’t examine how socioeconomic stressors might influence the relationship between walking and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer’s Association, in its first clinical guidelines on blood biomarker testing, said Tuesday that tests that have over 90% sensitivity (ability to identify positive results) and 90% specificity (ability to identify negative results) can be used instead of current diagnostic methods like PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group said that tests that have over 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity can be used to triage patients, meaning negative results rule can rule out Alzheimer’s with high probability but positive results should be confirmed with the standard diagnostic methods, given that these blood tests have a higher likelihood of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors stressed that the guidelines should not be considered a substitute for a full clinical evaluation and that they apply only to people who are in the care of specialists and have already been confirmed to have cognitive impairment. The authors also noted that there’s wide variability in the blood tests on the market and that many do not meet the accuracy thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They did not endorse specific tests, but reviewed dozens that measured biomarkers such as pTau217, the ratio of pTau217 to non-pTau217, and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. They will post a chart of the various tests and their accuracy in an online portal that will be continually updated, said Rebecca Edelmayer, one of the guidelines’ authors and vice president of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The approval of new Alzheimer’s drugs in recent years has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/25/alzheimers-blood-test-diagnostics-leqembi/"&gt;ignited a race&lt;/a&gt; to roll out blood tests as a more convenient and cheaper way for patients to get diagnosed, and so far the Food and Drug Administration has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; one test. But up until now, doctors haven’t had clear guidelines on when to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the recommendations are expected to be updated over time, even the first stab could lead to more patients getting tested and diagnosed, particularly in rural areas, where access to scans and spinal fluid tests are typically more difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is reasonable. They’ve really thought through this very carefully in terms of making a diagnosis,” said Joseph Quinn, a professor of neurology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who was not involved in writing the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still best for patients who plan to start treatment to receive PET scans first, said Stephen Salloway, a professor of neurology at Brown University who was not involved with the guidelines. New therapies from Eisai, Biogen, and Eli Lilly aim to shrink a plaque in the brain called amyloid that’s thought to be linked to Alzheimer’s, and doctors, if possible, should scan patients not only before treatment but throughout treatment to ensure that the amyloid is shrinking, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blood tests can detect whether patients are positive or negative for amyloid, but are not reliable measures of how much amyloid is in their brain, said Salloway, who has consulted for drug companies making Alzheimer’s treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendations do not address how to use blood tests in the course of monitoring patients receiving treatment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have supported the development of blood tests, and Lilly has been trying to make it easier for patients to get diagnosed, recently striking an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/27/eli-lilly-alzheimers-disease-telemedicine-synapticure/"&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; with a telehealth provider in which it connects patients to a virtual platform so they can get a diagnosis if necessary and get a prescription for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the guidelines, the authors reviewed close to 50 studies. They excluded studies that analyzed populations of people who both did and didn’t have cognitive impairment, since they wanted to focus only on those with cognitive impairment. They only evaluated tests that used a single threshold that determined positive or negative results. And they also rated how certain the evidence was for each test’s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also serve as a “call to action” for researchers to understand how to conduct studies and publish results in a way for the Alzheimer’s Association to deem the tests as having strong evidence backing them up, said Edelmayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                 &lt;div class="post_text"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case of measles has been confirmed in a dormitory associated with the Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitch – 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, prompting urgent health guidance from the ODA Crown Heights Health Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient, a young Yeshiva bochur from Israel currently studying in the “Kevutza” program at 770, was officially diagnosed earlier on Tuesday with the highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk of a large-scale outbreak is real,” stated the medical team at ODA in a public health text message to its patients at 1:19 PM on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA didn’t disclose whether this bochur was a resident of the dormitories at 749 Eastern Parkway, 755 Eastern Parkway, 1414 President Street, 1214 Sterling Place, or another in the neighborhood. A medical source told COLlive it was the 755 dormitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please ensure all children and young adults are vaccinated with MMR. Watch for symptoms: fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea,” the ODA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is an illness that spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause high fever, cough, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and diarrhea. It can also lead to serious complications, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA Health Center, located at 779 East New York Avenue, added, “If visiting a medical facility with these signs, call ahead so the case can be properly managed and exposure minimized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents were advised to review their family’s vaccination records and contact their doctor or the ODA Health Center with any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For appointments or questions, contact the ODA Crown Heights Health Center at (718) 260-4670.&lt;/p&gt;
