			&lt;p&gt;Many of us turn to Sudoku, Wordle or brain-training apps to sharpen our minds. But research is increasingly showing one of the best ways to boost memory, focus and brain health is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reviewed data from more than 250,000 participants across 2,700 studies. We found exercise helps boost brain function – whether it's walking, cycling, yoga, dancing, or even playing active video games such as Pokémon GO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving your body improves how we think, make decisions, remember things and stay focused – no matter your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our review adds to a growing body of research that shows regular physical activity &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;improves&lt;/a&gt; three key areas of brain function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cognition, which is your overall ability to think clearly, learn and make decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory, especially short-term memory and the ability to remember personal experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;executive function, which includes focus, planning, problem-solving and managing emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review, which means we looked at the results of more than 130 high-quality research reviews that had already combined findings from many exercise studies. These studies usually involved people starting a new, structured exercise program, not just tracking the exercise they were already doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the effects on cognition, memory and executive function, the original studies used a range of brain function tests. These included things like remembering word lists, solving puzzles, or quickly switching between tasks – simple activities designed to reliably measure how well the brain is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements were small to moderate. On average, exercise led to a noticeable boost in cognition, with slightly smaller but still meaningful gains in memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits showed up across all age groups, though children and teens saw major gains in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="157627" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;) showed greater improvements in executive function after physical activity than other population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain started responding fairly quickly – many people experienced improvements after just 12 weeks of starting regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the greatest benefits were seen in those doing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week, aiming for a total of about 150 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening in the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities such as walking or cycling can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;increase the size of the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who did aerobic exercise for a year grew their hippocampus by 2%, effectively reversing one to two years of age-related brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More intense workouts, such as running or high-intensity interval training, can further &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2017/8305287"&gt;boost neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; – the brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself. This helps you learn more quickly, think more clearly and stay mentally sharp with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another reason to get moving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population is ageing. By 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health"&gt;one in six of people will be aged over 60&lt;/a&gt;. With that comes a rising risk of dementia,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="157627" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many adults aren't moving enough. One in three adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;aren't meeting the recommended levels&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;should aim for&lt;/a&gt; at least 150 of moderate exercise – such as brisk walking – each week, or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous activity, like running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also important to incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises, such as lifting weights, into workouts at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everyday movement counts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to run marathons or lift heavy weights to benefit. Our study showed lower-intensity activities such as yoga, tai chi and "exergames" (active video games) can be just as effective – sometimes even more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These activities engage both the brain and body. Tai chi, for instance, requires focus, coordination and memorising sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exergames often include real-time decision-making and rapid response to cues. This trains attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these forms of movement are inclusive. They can be done at home, outdoors, or with friends, making them a great option for people of all fitness levels or those with limited mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you may already be doing a lot through daily life – like walking instead of driving or carrying shopping bags home – it's still important to find time for structured exercise, such as lifting weights at the gym or doing a regular yoga class, to get the full benefits for your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real-life applications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a grandparent, consider playing Wii Sports virtual tennis or bowling with your grandchild. If you're a teenager with signs of ADHD, try a dance class, and see if it impacts your concentration in class. If you're a busy parent, you might be more clear-headed if you can squeeze a 20-minute yoga video session between meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, you're not just being active, you're giving your brain a valuable tune-up. And unlike most brain-training apps or supplements, exercise delivers far reaching benefits, including improved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721002914?casa_token=pXaOJcQJ7d0AAAAA:0i4BjaxqJ21AQ2bGXI4DfQ6twKNybrg7c2f0_Xs7t-hWyDOH0SuKGTfruy-JlC_rMokUM3iWdlSQ"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplaces and schools are starting to take note. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2654"&gt;Short movement breaks&lt;/a&gt; are being introduced during the workday to improve employee focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that incorporate &lt;a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0569-9"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; into the classroom are seeing improvements in students' attention and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most powerful and accessible tools we have for supporting brain health. Best of all, it's free, widely available and it's never too late to start.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253751/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gov. Josh Green made the announcement during a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=1176998410252423" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;news conference&lt;/a&gt; this morning, in which he urged everyone to get vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was confirmed Monday night, Green said, in a child that recently returned from international travel. The child developed a fever, runny nose and cough shortly after returning to Hawaii, and sought medical care at Queen’s Island Urgent Care Kapahulu after breaking out in a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said the child is now recovering at home on Oahu, and a household member with similar symptoms is being evaluated for possible measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want anyone to panic,” said Green. “There is no reason to panic, and our Department of Health is on it. We’ve been talking through the morning and night about what we do. This is where good public health comes in. But we do have a kid with the measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH is investigating the case and working to identify and directly inform those who may have been exposed to the child. Flight notifications have been issued, and an alert has been sent to health care providers statewide.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The kid’s doing well, by all accounts,” said Green, “so we send our love and prayers to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CDC, 9 out of 10 people of all ages exposed to an infected person will become infected if they do not have immunity. Exposure includes entering a room up to two hours after an infected person has been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me really clear — you’re sitting near somebody with the measles and you’re not vaccinated, you’ve got a really good chance to catch it,” said Green. “I mean, this stuff is infectious, so it’s very important that you listen carefully to our Department of Health officials to find out if you happened to be in that lounge with them, or on the plane with them, or at a play date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can also result in complications including pneumonia and encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. The best way to prevent measles, said DOH, is through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said he has issued an emergency rules allowing a child with a religious exemption to receive an MMR vaccine while still retaining their religious exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s last detection of measles two years ago was also travel-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, DOH reported &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/department-of-health-announces-measles-infection-identified-in-oahu-international-traveler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt; of measles in an unvaccinated Oahu resident returning from international travel. Several weeks later, DOH reported a second case in an Oahu resident who was exposed to the first case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. continent, meanwhile, the number of confirmed measles cases has now grown to 607 in 22 states, mostly in Texas, but also in New Mexico, Oklahoma and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two school-aged children have died in Texas from the recent outbreak of measles, with the most &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/what-to-know-about-u-s-measles-cases-on-the-rise/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;recent death&lt;/a&gt; being an 8-year-old girl who was unvaccinated and previously in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH, meanwhile, informs the public of possible exposure at the following places and times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;March &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt;, 10:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu at C gates, customs and baggage claim area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. at Manoa Valley District Park art class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;, 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. at Queen’s Island Urgent Care on Kapahulu Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;, 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., Terminal 2 departure areas, TSA checkpoints and the gate area for Delta flight 309 to Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH urges anyone who may have been potentially exposed at these places and times — and who are not up-to-date on their MMR vaccines or unsure of their status — to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were potentially exposed should watch for symptoms for three weeks, and if any measles symptoms appear, should immediately isolate at home and contact their health care provider right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;MEASLES CASE CONFIRMED IN CHILD ON OʻAHU — DOH NOTIFIES PUBLIC OF MEASLES EXPOSURE LOCATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;span&gt;Posted on Apr 8, 2025 in  &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/category/newsroom/" rel="category tag"&gt;Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
				
&lt;p&gt;HONOLULU — The Hawaiʻi Department of Health (DOH) State Laboratories Division last night confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated child under 5 years of age on Oʻahu. The DOH is investigating the case to identify those who might have been exposed and is working with them to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The child had recently returned from international travel with its parents. The child developed a fever, runny nose and cough shortly after returning to Hawaiʻi, sought medical care after breaking out in a rash, and is now recovering at home. A household member with similar symptoms is also being evaluated for possible measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed to measles if they visited the following locations during the specified times:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C gates, customs and baggage claim area on March 30 between 10:50 a.m. and 2 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 2 departures, TSA checkpoints and gate area for Delta flight 309 to Atlanta, Georgia, on April 4 between 1 and 7 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mānoa Valley District Park art class &lt;/strong&gt;on April 1, between 9 to 10 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queen’s Island Urgent Care Kapahulu &lt;/strong&gt;on April 4, between 8 a.m. to noon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flight notifications have been issued for the airlines and airports through which the confirmed and suspected cases traveled. The DOH is also reaching out directly to individuals who had known contact with the confirmed or suspected case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were at one of the above locations on the day and time specified:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have never received a measles-containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. &lt;/strong&gt;Vaccine or immune globulin can be given to prevent measles if received shortly after exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be vigilant. &lt;/strong&gt;Watch for symptoms&lt;strong&gt; until three weeks after your last exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice the symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunocompromised?&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Already vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another dose?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve complete immunity, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A medical advisory will be issued to healthcare providers statewide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly contagious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most highly contagious viruses in the world. It spreads by direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. An infected person can spread measles to others from four days before developing the rash through four days afterward. The virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically include fever of greater than 101 F, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after being exposed. Three to five days after symptoms start, a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best protection against measles is the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. All children should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine. The first dose is given at age 12-15 months and the second dose at 4-6 years of age. If you are planning travel, consult your healthcare provider to determine whether an additional or earlier dose of MMR is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All adults born during or after 1957 should also have documentation of at least one MMR vaccination, unless they have had a blood test showing they are immune to measles or have had the disease. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure to measles (e.g., post-secondary school students, international travelers and healthcare personnel) need a second dose of MMR vaccine, at least four weeks after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are exposed and not protected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not protected against measles and are exposed to someone with the disease, contact your healthcare provider immediately:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• The MMR vaccine may prevent or lessen the severity of measles if given with 72 hours of exposure&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Immune globulin (a blood product containing antibodies to the measles virus) may prevent or lessen the severity of measles if given within six days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not protected against measles, believe you have been exposed and cannot reach your healthcare provider promptly, please call the DOH Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586, or call the Disease Investigation Branch at 808-586-8362.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. Care of patients with measles consists mainly of ensuring adequate intake of fluids, bed rest and fever control. Patients with complications may need treatment specific to their problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contact your healthcare provider to get the MMR vaccine, or locate a vaccine provider at &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/en/"&gt;https://www.vaccines.gov/en/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When exposed to harmful bacteria, the worms adapted by rewiring the roles of key neurons and neuromodulators to reduce feeding and resist quiescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One neuropeptide, FLP-13, flipped its usual function depending on whether worms faced stress or infection. These findings show that animals can flexibly reuse the same neural components in different combinations to cope with diverse environmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Repurposing:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons and peptides changed functions during infection, revealing unexpected brain flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLP-13 Flip:&lt;/strong&gt; A single peptide promoted sleep in one context but helped fight lethargy during infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survival Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Resisting quiescence with FLP-13 extended worm survival against deadly bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you are a person about town or a worm in a dish, life can throw all kinds of circumstances your way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you need is a nervous system flexible enough to cope. In a new study, MIT neuroscientists show how even a simple animal can switch many gears in its brain to muster an adaptive response to a deadly infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108504"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and viruses." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Further experiments showed that FLP-13 acted on a widespread neuropeptide receptor called DMSR-1 to prevent quiescence. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worms fed on infectious &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; bacteria that made them sick (as it does to humans), they responded similarly to many animals including people. They ate less and became more lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked across the nervous system to see how that sickness behavior happened, they discovered that the worms had completely revamped the roles of several of its 302 neurons and some of the peptides they secrete across the brain to modulate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systems that responded to stress in one case or satiety in another became reconfigured to cope with the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a question of how do you adapt to your environment with the highest level of flexibility given the set of neurons and neuromodulators you have,” said postdoc Sreeparna Pradhan, co-lead author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. “How do you make the maximum set of options available to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research to find out took place in the lab of senior author Steve Flavell, an associate professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradhan, who was supported by a fellowship from MIT’s K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center during the work, teamed up with former Flavell lab graduate student Gurrein Madan to lead the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradhan said the team discovered several surprises in the course of the study including that a neuropeptide called FLP-13completely flipped its function in infected animals versus animals experiencing other forms of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research had shown that when worms are stressed by heat, a neuron called ALA releases FLP-13 to cause the worms to go into quiescence, a sleep-like state. But when the worms in the new study ate &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; bacteria and got sick, a band of other neurons released FLP-13 to fight off quiescence, enabling the worms to survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ALA took on a completely different role during sickness: leading the charge to suppress feeding by emitting a different group of peptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A comprehensive approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how the worms responded to infection, the team tracked many features of the worms’ behavior for days as the worms fought the infections and as the researchers made genetic manipulations to probe the underlying mechanisms at play. They also recorded activity across the whole brains of sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of a comprehensive observation and experimentation is difficult to achieve in more complex animals, but &lt;em&gt;C. elegans’&lt;/em&gt; relative simplicity makes it a tractable testbed, Pradhan said. The team’s approach also is what allowed it to make so many unexpected findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Pradhan didn’t suspect that the ALA neuron would turn out to be the neuron that suppressed feeding, but when she observed their behavior for long enough, she started to realize the reduced feeding arose from the worms taking little breaks in that they wouldn’t normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as she and Madan were manipulating more than a dozen genes they thought might be affecting sickness behavior and feeding in the worm, she included another called &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt; that she had read about years ago that seemed to promote bouts of “microsleep” in the worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they knocked out &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt;, they found that those worms didn’t reduce feeding when they got infected, unlike normal animals. It just so happens that &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt; is specifically needed for ALA to function properly, so that’s when the team realized ALA might be involved in the feeding reduction behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To know for sure, they then knocked out the various peptides that ALA releases and saw that when they knocked out three in particular, &lt;em&gt;flp-24, nlp-8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;flp-7&lt;/em&gt;, infected worms didn’t exhibit reduced feeding upon infection. That clinched that ALA drives the reduced feeding sickness behavior by emitting those three peptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Pradhan and Madan’s screens also revealed that when infected worms were missing &lt;em&gt;flp-13&lt;/em&gt;, they would go into a quiescence state much sooner than infected worms with the peptide available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the worms that fought off the quiescence state lived longer. They found that fighting off quiescence depended on the FLP-13 coming from four neurons (I5, I1, ASH and OLL) but not from ALA. Further experiments showed that FLP-13 acted on a widespread neuropeptide receptor called DMSR-1 to prevent quiescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last major surprise of the study was that the quiescence that &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; infection induces in worms is not the same as other forms of sleepiness that show up in other contexts, such as after satiety or heat stress. In those cases, worms don’t wake easily (with a little poke), but amid infection their quiescence was readily reversible. It seemed more like lethargy than sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the lab’s ability image all neural activity during behavior, Pradhan and Madan discerned that a neuron called ASI was particularly active during the bouts of lethargy. That observation solidified further when they showed that ASI’s secretion of the peptide DAF-7 was required for the quiescence to emerge in infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the study showed that the worms repurpose and reconfigure—sometimes to the point of completely reversing—the functions of neurons and peptides to mount an adaptive response to infection versus a different problem like stress. The results therefore shed light on what has been a tricky question to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do brains use their repertoire of cells, circuits and neuromodulators to deal with what life hands them? At least part of the answer, seems to be by reshuffling existing components rather than creating unique ones for each situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How combinations of neuromodulators released from different neuronal sources control the diverse internal states that animals exhibit remains an open question,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The states of stress, satiety and infection are not induced by unique sets of neuromodulators. Instead, one larger set of neuromodulators may be deployed from different sources and in different combinations to specify these different internal states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Pradhan, Madan and Flavell the paper’s other authors are Di Kang, Eric Bueno, Adam Atanas, Talya Kramer, Ugur Dag, Jessica Lage, Matthew Gomes, Alicia Kun-Yang Lu and Jungyeon Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Support for the research came from the The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Freedom Together Foundation, the K.

Upon infection by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PA14, &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; decrease feeding, then display reversible bouts of quiescence, and eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ALA neuron and its neuropeptides FLP-7, FLP-24, and NLP-8, which control stress-induced sleep in uninfected animals, promote the PA14-induced feeding reduction. However, the ALA neuropeptide FLP-13 instead delays quiescence and death in infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-specific genetic perturbations show that the neurons that release FLP-13 to delay quiescence in infected animals are distinct from ALA. A brain-wide imaging screen reveals that infection-induced quiescence involves ASI and DAF-7/TGF-beta, which control satiety-induced quiescence in uninfected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a common set of neuromodulators are recruited across different physiological states, acting from distinct neural sources and in distinct combinations to drive state-dependent behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:21:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBFajJ4Z0tUX1g3WWNSTmZhMmNtVHFkemdmWEVudTFVY1VwcENZV1N3TE9kOTZtb3IyQUNDdmV2Q21ESWR2WjJBcTRjcGJMM21yRFQ1T19uc3dPX3FncGdUNjB0WkhqWHZFeXdvYw</guid></item><item><title>What will it take to get measles under control? - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE43blBPSVdjUWNGcEpVVndFcmhpV3dEWjJXNjZYYmZDanpoOVZXQjVic2RqX0tCSkhEZDJlRUR0bEd3cjM1clgxLXdzN05oanpNT2RzUndiLWdDNVJwc3VTSkhWYkU5aW5RbHZGOTZXbTNwUngwV01uVlRiSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;It's been 25 years since measles was officially "eliminated" from the United States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's a technical term. In public health, it means measles has not had a steady twelve month spread. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now there are measles cases in several states The biggest number of cases are in West Texas where two kids have died. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quarter of a century after measles was officially eliminated in the US, the disease is once again spreading in West Texas, New Mexico and there are cases in several other states.

Researchers found that it improves energy production and eases stress within nerve cells, helping maintain muscle function and slow degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the body absorbs kaempferol poorly, and massive quantities would be needed for therapeutic effects through diet alone. Scientists are now developing lipid-based nanoparticles to deliver the compound more effectively to the brain and nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotective Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaempferol boosts energy production and reduces cell stress in ALS-affected neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorption Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The body poorly absorbs dietary kaempferol, limiting its therapeutic potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nanoparticle Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to encapsulate kaempferol in lipid nanoparticles to improve absorption and target neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural compound found in everyday fruits and vegetables may hold the key to protecting nerve cells — and it’s showing promise as a potential treatment for ALS and dementia, according to new research from the University of Missouri.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting to discover a naturally occurring compound that may help people suffering from ALS or dementia,” Smita Saxena, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the School of Medicine and lead author of the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108496"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and kale." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Despite its challenges, kaempferol remains a promising candidate for treating ALS, especially since it works even after symptoms start.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found this compound had a strong impact in terms of maintaining motor and muscle function and reducing muscle atrophy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discovered that kaempferol, a natural antioxidant found in certain fruits and vegetables, such as kale, berries and endives, may support nerve cell health and holds promise as a potential treatment for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;n lab-grown nerve cells from ALS patients, the compound helped the cells produce more energy and eased stress in the protein-processing center of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the compound improved overall cell function and slowed nerve cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that kaempferol worked by targeting a crucial pathway that helps control energy production and protein management — two functions that are disrupted in individuals with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe this is one of the first compounds capable of targeting both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria simultaneously,” Saxena said. “By interacting with both of these components within nerve cells, it has the potential to elicit a powerful neuroprotective effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The challenge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch? The body doesn’t absorb kaempferol easily, and it could take a large amount to see real benefits in humans. For instance, an individual with ALS would need to consume at least 10-11 pounds of kale in a day to obtain a beneficial dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies don’t absorb kaempferol very well from the vegetables we eat,” Saxena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of this, only a small amount reaches our tissues, limiting how effective it can be. We need to find ways to increase the dose of kaempferol or modify it so it’s absorbed into the bloodstream more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle is getting the compound into the brain. The blood-brain barrier — a tightly locked layer of cells that blocks harmful substances — also makes it harder for larger molecules like kaempferol to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, kaempferol remains a promising candidate for treating ALS, especially since it works even after symptoms start. It also shows potential for other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the compound easier for the body to absorb, Saxena’s team at the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building is exploring ways to boost its uptake by neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One promising approach involves packaging lipid-based nanoparticles — tiny spherical particles made of fats that are commonly used in drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is to encapsulate kaempferol within lipid-based nanoparticles that are easily absorbed by the neurons,” Saxena said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would target kaempferol to neurons to greatly increase its beneficial effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is currently generating the nanoparticles with hopes of testing them by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease and ALS research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Diedrich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Diedrich – University of Missouri&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-025-01927-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kaempferol enhances ER-mitochondria coupling and protects motor neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in C9ORF72-ALS&lt;/a&gt;” by Smita Saxena et al. &lt;em&gt;Acta Neuropathologica Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaempferol enhances ER-mitochondria coupling and protects motor neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in C9ORF72-ALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat expansions in the &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Considerable progress has been made in identifying &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-mediated disease and resolving its underlying etiopathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributions of intrinsic mitochondrial deficits as well as chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress to the development of the&lt;em&gt; C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-linked pathology are well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, to date, no cure or effective therapy is available, and thus attempts to find a potential drug target, have received increasing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated the mode of action and therapeutic effect of a naturally occurring dietary flavanol, kaempferol in preclinical rodent and human models of &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, kaempferol treatment of &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-ALS human patient-derived motor neurons/neurons, resolved mitochondrial deficits, promoted resiliency against severe ER stress, and conferred neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment of symptomatic &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; mice with kaempferol, normalized mitochondrial calcium uptake, restored mitochondria function, and diminished ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in vivo, chronic kaempferol administration ameliorated pathological motor dysfunction and inhibited motor neuron degeneration, highlighting the translational potential of kaempferol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in silico modelling identified a novel kaempferol target and mechanistically the neuroprotective mechanism of kaempferol is through the iP3R-VDAC1 pathway via the modulation of GRP75 expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, kaempferol holds great promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases where both mitochondrial and ER dysfunction are causally linked to the pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 21:41:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBtMzZVRURMT3lteXJfb0ZDSE9Pakd5UVVHTElvMmFvVkUzcXV4NGY5WmJZdmVYTEpvc1k3VWNudFpsa2lYdThGWkRwRDZ1YVExV0FKVGRDNHAxZWo5NzVGOVdJbFRQb2NON3FkSWp3</guid></item><item><title>Low Vitamin K Intake May Accelerate Age-Related Memory Decline - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE9rYkFQYWktdWY0MGRsbkYxLWd5WU9WMWQ0blRaNzF5N2YwTnlYZkpEdzhNOXk2TlBPNlM5X185VWg3NHdsc1dSVkdRaDh1aFVZOF9CbnlDU05oSF9xTjFLNXhmLU1BWEt3blE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that insufficient vitamin K may harm brain health and memory as we age. In rodent models, a vitamin K-deficient diet led to increased brain inflammation and fewer newly formed neurons in the hippocampus—key factors in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with low vitamin K struggled with memory and spatial learning tasks, indicating clear cognitive deficits. Researchers stress the importance of a healthy diet rich in leafy greens rather than relying on supplements to support brain health during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice on a low-vitamin K diet performed poorly on memory and learning tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Neurogenesis:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin K deficiency decreased new neuron formation in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Deficient mice showed more activated microglia, indicating brain inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As scientists seek to unravel the intricate potential connections between nutrition and the aging brain, a new study from researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University is shedding light on how insufficient consumption of vitamin K may adversely affect cognition as people get older. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted in middle-aged rodents, suggests that a lack of vitamin K may increase inflammation and hamper proliferation of neural cells in the hippocampus, a portion of the brain that is capable of generating new cells and is central to functions such as learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108492"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by vitamin K rich foods." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, green peas, kale, and spinach. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, green peas, kale, and spinach. It is already known to play an essential role in blood clotting, and research suggests it may also have positive effects on cardiovascular health as well as joint health, says Sarah Booth, director of the HNRCA and senior author of the study. Booth is also a professor at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also research that indicates vitamin K contributes to brain function and that brain function declines during the aging process,” says Tong Zheng, lead author of the study and a research scientist at the HNRCA.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K seems to have a protective effect. Our research is trying to understand the underlying mechanism for that effect, so that we might one day be able to target those mechanisms specifically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learning and Memory Affected&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, researchers conducted a six-month dietary intervention to compare the cognitive performance of mice that were fed a low-vitamin K diet and those receiving a standard diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on menaquinone-4, a form of vitamin K prevalent in brain tissue, and found significantly lower levels of this nutrient in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deficiency is associated with noticeable cognitive decline as measured in a series of behavioral tests designed to assess their learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one such test, the novel object recognition test, the vitamin K-deficient mice showed a diminished ability to distinguish between familiar and new objects, a clear indication of impaired memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second test, to measure spatial learning, the mice were tasked with learning the location of a hidden platform in a pool of water. The vitamin K-deficient mice took considerably longer to learn the task compared to their counterparts with adequate vitamin K levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers then examined the mice brain tissue, they found significant changes within the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they observed a reduced number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the vitamin K-deficient mice. This decrease translated to fewer newly generated immature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurogenesis is thought to play a critical role in learning and memory, and its impairment could directly contribute to the cognitive decline observed in the study,” Zheng says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer of complexity, the researchers also found evidence of increased neuroinflammation in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a higher number of activated microglia, which are the major immune cells in the brain,” says Zheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While microglia play a vital role in maintaining brain health, their overactivation can lead to chronic inflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Healthy Diet &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Booth and Zheng emphasize that their research doesn’t mean that people should rush out and start taking vitamin K supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to eat a healthy diet,” says Booth. “They need to eat their vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booth noted that the Tufts team works closely with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, with the Rush team conducting observational studies in humans of brain health and cognition, while Tufts focuses on models to study specific mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that a healthy diet works, and that people who don’t eat a healthy diet don’t live as long or do as well cognitively,” says Booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By choreographing animal and human studies together, we can do a better job of improving brain health long-term by identifying and targeting specific mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain aging research news&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2022/12/07/tufts-researchers-find-brains-more-vitamin-d-function-better"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Rafferty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Rafferty – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.01.023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Low Vitamin K Intake Impairs Cognition, Neurogenesis, and Elevates Neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 Mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Tong Zheng et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Vitamin K Intake Impairs Cognition, Neurogenesis, and Elevates Neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 Mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its important roles in blood coagulation and bone formation, vitamin K (VK) contributes to brain function. Low dietary VK intake, which is common among older adults, is associated with age-related cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying VK’s effects on cognition, we investigated the effects of low VK (LVK) intake on cognition in C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female 9-mo-old C57BL/6 mice (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 60) were fed an LVK diet or a control diet for 6 mo. Behavioral tests were performed on a subset of mice (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 26) at 15 mo, and brain tissues were collected for follow-up analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menaquinone-4, the predominant VK form in the brain, was significantly lower in LVK mice compared to controls (15.6 ± 13.3 compared with 189 ± 186 pmol/g, respectively, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). LVK mice showed reduced recognition memory in the novel object test by spending a lower percentage of time exploring the novel object compared to controls (47.45% ± 4.17 compared with 58.08% ± 3.03, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also spent a significantly longer time learning the task of locating the platform in the Morris water maze test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, LVK mice had a significantly lower number of proliferating cells and fewer newly generated immature neurons compared to control mice. Additionally, more activated microglia cells were identified in the LVK mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0035"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data indicate that LVK intake reduced menaquinone-4 concentrations in brain tissues and impaired learning- and memory-related cognitive function. This impairment may be related to the observed reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and elevated neural inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 21:21:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9rYkFQYWktdWY0MGRsbkYxLWd5WU9WMWQ0blRaNzF5N2YwTnlYZkpEdzhNOXk2TlBPNlM5X185VWg3NHdsc1dSVkdRaDh1aFVZOF9CbnlDU05oSF9xTjFLNXhmLU1BWEt3blE</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. claims curve is flattening in Texas measles outbreak.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles or nearly 100% effective against dying of measles after contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some people may be at risk for an adverse reaction with any vaccine, so experts say it's important to discuss the risks and benefits with a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It should be an easy decision, as easy as buying a car seat and strapping your kid in," Marks said about getting a vaccine if eligible. "You would never drive without your kid strapped into their car seat.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baked potato chips aren’t necessarily “healthier” than regular chips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The baked chips are typically processed and “predigested,” so they contain less nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try looking for regular potato chips with just three ingredients: potatoes, oil and salt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutritious snack choices are an important part of a healthy eating pattern. Handfuls of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; and dried fruits are fiber-packed and can help keep you satisfied—but sometimes you just want a bag of potato chips, and that’s totally OK too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you think choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-baked-chips-healthier-for-you-8425818" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;baked potato chips&lt;/a&gt; over regular chips is the obvious healthier choice, you may be mistaken. In a recent interview segment for &lt;em&gt;This Morning&lt;/em&gt;, gut health expert and dietitian Megan Rossi, Ph.D., RD, shares the difference between the snacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We look at the ingredients lists, really interestingly, the legit ones have got potato, [but] the baked ones typically have potato flakes, which means it’s kind of ultra-processed potato, kind of pre-digested,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What Rossi means by the snack being a pre-digested food is that the baked chips are processed by breaking down a whole food (i.e. potato into potato flakes) which in turn can eliminate nutrients from the natural food source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So although the calorie and saturated fat count for baked chips may be a little lower than regular varieties, they contain less vitamins and minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin C. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “And often [baked chips] add extra flavors and added sugars,” Rossi notes. This can also be noted for other flavored regular chips—we’re looking at you, sour cream and onion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to remember that all foods and drinks—including regular chips or baked chips—can be included in a healthy eating pattern when done so in moderation. But unless you have a preference for the baked chips, it’s best to stick to the tried-and-true standard potato chips with a minimal ingredient list. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Try to get the ones with just three ingredients: potato, oil and some salt,” the dietitian says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potato chips are also easy (and dare we say, more delicious) to make at home. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251600/microwave-potato-chips/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Microwave Potato Chips&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270403/air-fryer-sweet-potato-chips/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Air-Fryer Sweet Potato Chips&lt;/a&gt;, the crispy snack is an easy DIY, and you can control the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; content and customize the seasoning when making them from scratch.

   &lt;p&gt;Slipping vaccination rates in West Texas have led to the state's largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, with more than 500 patients affected as of April 8 and cases spreading to New Mexico and Oklahoma. Last week, an unvaccinated Texas child died from measles, marking the third death tied to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say there is a playbook for slowing outbreaks like this one: Identify cases. Isolate patients. Track where they've been and who they may have exposed. Most of all, drive up the vaccination rate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the way to stop it. This only ends with immunity," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at The Brown University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This strategy isn't novel. The benefits of measles vaccination have been well-established for more than half a century. The emergence of the vaccine in the 1960s meant parents no longer had to accept the risks of serious complications or death that came with the common childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By 2000, measles was considered eliminated in the U.S. — thanks to vaccination. But misinformation about the vaccine began to spread &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;around the same time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, the largest city in the West Texas region affected by the outbreak, said she is seeing the impact of that misinformation today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Talking to the community, they really stopped vaccinating about 20 years ago, which is in line with what we've seen in other communities across the United States," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with rare and usually mild side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. vaccination rates have dipped for everything from measles to flu over the past five years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Texas, measles immunization rates in the state and kindergarteners dropped around two and a half percent between 2019 and 2023, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The same is true at the national level, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Gaines County, the epicenter of the West Texas outbreak, only around 82% of kindergarteners were vaccinated for measles in the 2023-24 school year, compared to the 95% recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to maintain herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells also said she and her colleagues have ramped up testing and vaccination efforts in the area, with some success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, it's an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The uptake for vaccines has … definitely been a struggle. I want to be honest with that," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She said her department is following the established measles playbook: conducting contact tracing, letting the public know about possible exposures and encouraging isolation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unless Texas declares a public health emergency, local officials can't take more aggressive steps, like preemptively quarantining unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said there are no plans to declare an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58650" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the outbreak grows, a range of bills aimed at loosening vaccine mandates are being considered by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And at the national level, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has at times downplayed the importance of vaccines and promoted unproven alternative treatments for measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an op-ed published last month, he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;suggested vitamin A &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;could "dramatically reduce measles mortality."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend two doses of vitamin A for children to relieve measles symptoms, especially if they're so sick they're hospitalized, vitamin A is not a cure and does not prevent transmission of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a second child in Texas died from measles last weekend, Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1908967854394982414%7Ctwgr%5E7301ea2c495eb45b0b1b74b00d52e2e24f5c5eb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpr.org%2Fpublic-health%2F2025-04-07%2Frfk-jr-visits-west-texas-after-second-child-dies-of-measles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social media statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he had traveled to visit the child's family. He said in the statement that vaccines are the most effective defense against this disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nuzzo said conflicting messaging adds a layer of difficulty for health professionals responding to the outbreak on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the federal communications is muddying the waters and making the jobs that the local officials have in responding to this outbreak harder," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Proposed federal funding cuts are also shaping up to be an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, the Department of Government Efficiency announced it would terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Van Deusen said the agency has notified more than 50 local health departments to stop spending funds under the affected federal awards — some of which have been used for immunization programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lacey Nobles, Lubbock's director of communications, said the city is still assessing what the impact of those lost funds will be locally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the confirmed cases in Texas surpass 500, Wells is bracing for a long road.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She expects it to be a year before the case count is back to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I cried hysterically while holding my three-and-a-half-month-old baby, praying she wouldn't have to grow up without a mom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Susan Ash, now 25, pictured above with daughter Julia who was born in July 2024. Shortly after the birth, Ms Ash was diagnosed with a brain tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a picture of the scan of Ms Ash' brain, with the tumor shown by the yellow lines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'In retrospect, as a new parent I wasn't connecting the dots and truthfully wasn't concerned about this — I assumed it was stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But when I went back to work seven weeks postpartum, the duration and frequency of these episodes [headaches and blurred vision] was increasing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found the tumor on her left occipital lobe — the part of the brain at the back of the head responsible for processing visual information from the right eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, the mass was not cancerous, but its location explained the strange flashes Ms Ash had been experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that during pregnancy, surging hormone levels — particularly estrogen and progesterone — can stimulate the growth of brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones can bind to receptors on the tumor itself, potentially accelerating its development, especially if it had been silently growing for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms. Ash gave birth to her daughter, Julia, in July 2024. Not long after, she began experiencing vision changes and persistent migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned but not alarmed, she visited her doctor, who referred her to a neurologist. But when the symptoms seemed to ease after she began taking magnesium supplements, she canceled the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then in October, while playing soccer with her family, Ms Ash suddenly collapsed mid-game. She had suffered a grand mal seizure — a severe type of seizure that affects the entire brain, causing muscle stiffness and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital, where imaging scans revealed a marble-sized tumor pressing on her brain. It was also causing irritation within the skull, leading to swelling, compression and intense headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash later shared that she had suffered from migraines for years and even recalled episodes of visual disturbances — like flashing lights — as early as age ten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now believe these may have been early signs of the tumor’s presence as it slowly grew in silence over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ash was diagnosed after she suffered a seizure while at a family soccer game. She was rushed to the hospital where scans revealed the tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She is pictured above with her partner and daughter Julia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Describing the symptoms after they returned, she said: 'On my right side I would see bright flashing lights that often moved in a circular motion, which would last a couple of minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then once that subsided, my peripheral vision would go blurry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash was given two options by doctors: To either leave the tumor, or take it out and risk losing vision in her right eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has decided to remove it, saying it's worth the risk in case it leads to more problems later. The operation is scheduled to take place in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Although there is a chance I will lose the vision in my right eye, it is a small price to pay to be alive.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight months after giving birth, the young mom says the diagnosis and vision problems mean that she now can't drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also says that the seizures have led her to be unable to work, leaving her with financial stress as she navigates motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash, now 25, has now made it her mission to connect with other people going through similar health battles online, and raising awareness of the early symptoms preceding her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 90,000 Americans are diagnosed with a brain tumor every year, although they are mostly aged 40 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ash is pictured above with her family.

Many of these studies, however, were focused on single ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In real life, we ingest a mixture of additives,” said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, who co-authored the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Touvier and her team looked at about eight years of data from more than 108,000 adults from the &lt;a href="https://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/upload/siteinfo/files/ck/files/protocole%20general%20en%20anglais%20NutriNet_Aug2013_EM_03_09_13.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;French NutriNet-Santé cohort&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running study that looks at the links between food and health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Poring over the participants’ reported diets, the researchers identified five mixtures of additives people commonly consumed together. The combinations don’t look unlike an ingredient list you might find on the label of an ultra-processed food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 1: Sodium carbonates; diphosphates; glycerol; ammonium carbonates; potassium carbonates; sorbitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 2: Modified starches; pectins; guar gum; carrageenan; polyphosphates; potassium sorbate; curcumin; xanthan gum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 3: Magnesium carbonates; riboflavin; alpha-tocopherol; ammonium carbonates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 4: Ammonium carbonates; sodium carbonates; diphosphates; alpha-tocopherol; DATEM; magnesium carbonates; lecithins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 5: Citric acid; sodium citrates; phosphoric acid; sulphite ammonia caramel; acesulfame K; aspartame; sucralose; arabic gum; malic acid; carnauba wax; paprika extract, capsanthin, and capsorubin; anthocyanins; guar gum; pectins &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s relatively uncommon for all of them to appear in a single product, however, it’s entirely possible to consume all of them across different foods throughout the day, especially when eating a variety of processed or ultra-processed foods,” said Mengxi Du, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies nutrition and health and wasn’t involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrageenan and potassium sorbate, two additives in Mixture 2, are found together in sweetened condensed milk. Xanthan gum is commonly found in mayonnaise and gluten-free prepared foods. Pectin is in cream cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These are pretty common products in someone’s fridge and a lot of times we combine them,” Du said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two groups — Mixture 2 and Mixture 5 — were linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, the researchers found. People with more of these combinations in their diet were more likely to develop the disease, regardless of how healthy their diet was overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mixture 2 was heavy in emulsifiers and thickening agents, including carrageenans, which are found in plant-based milks and processed meats, and modified starches, which thicken and stabilize packaged sauces, soups and baked goods. Mixture 5 contained ingredients commonly found in sugary and artificially-sweetened drinks, and included artificial sweeteners, natural dyes and acidifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the study was observational, meaning it doesn’t show cause and effect. Studies that require participants to recall their diets are also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-023-00818-w" target="_blank"&gt;notoriously tricky&lt;/a&gt;. The limitations make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the study, which Touvier and her team said will require more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The additives may be markers of something else, rather than causing Type 2 diabetes themselves,” said Dr. Tom Rifai, an internal and lifestyle medicine doctor in Cleveland Clinic’s department of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism. Rifai owns a lifestyle coaching company that includes nutrition counseling. “These could be a marker for what we call calorie density.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Food additives are ubiquitous in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-ultraprocessed-foods-public-schools-rcna196935" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which usually &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ultraprocessed-foods-cause-people-gain-weight-study-finds-n1006456" target="_blank"&gt;pack in many more calories&lt;/a&gt; in much smaller amounts of food than minimally and unprocessed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“At the very least, these additives are markers of ultra-processing, which we know makes people eat more without realizing they are taking in a lot more calories,” Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same is true for the three groups of additives that were not found to be linked to diabetes risk. Nestle said that while the study cannot show causation, the results are consistent with “present thinking that additives may well be anything but benign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some food additives do play an important role in food safety. Potassium sorbate, for example, stops yeast and fungus from growing in packaged food. Others — including &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00095-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, which create certain textures, and artificial dyes — have come under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;directed&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to review its rule on “generally recognized as safe,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fdas-hands-approach-additives-may-allow-unsafe-ingredients-food-expert-rcna165535" target="_blank"&gt;or GRAS&lt;/a&gt;, ingredients. The rule allows manufacturers to add certain additives to food without FDA review. It was originally intended for common ingredients such as salt or vinegar but has come to cover an expansive range of additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2023, California became the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-becomes-first-state-ban-four-chemicals-food-red-dye-no-3-rcna119660" target="_blank"&gt;first state to ban&lt;/a&gt; four food additives: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye No. 3. In March, &lt;a href="https://governor.wv.gov/article/governor-patrick-morrisey-signs-food-dye-legislation-law" target="_blank"&gt;West Virginia banned seven food dyes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the first three months of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/food-dyes-ban-rfk-jr-west-virginia-fda-rcna197180" target="_blank"&gt;20 states&lt;/a&gt; — including Illinois, Missouri, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania — introduced similar bans, but not on any of the additives included in the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too early to tell whether food additives, when eaten together, can have a synergistic effect, Du said. It’s possible that one ingredient, safe on its own, may be linked to health problems when combined with other ingredients, for example. Or an ingredient’s mild health effects could be amplified when mixed with other additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Given that ultra-processed foods account for more than half of the calories an average American eats in a day, research that further investigates such an effect is worthwhile, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:23:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQY09EeHhUd2FXYUh2Q2FXejNMa1JMbTNWSW9yTjBybWlwWW9pR2tqX1YwRXV2NF9ienlHT2MwRkF6VGswc2lQNDQ2cGxyVjBaY2tkd0htQUNfZUJlV0FLdmhRSndqT3kzV3liOWQxaVZUNzdvbXRnLWZ3UzFKdEFsUkktcXA3YUJ4cnFPUkRRRXpHWnpaN2VPTU9TZnZnZmhIWVM3ZkNiMk9pd2RrVGNUWGhFcUtpcGxFb0VhamZSN0VYd9IBVkFVX3lxTE1vakVsbVNDZUg0ZTIwSVJDUzBRRzZ5ZDk3ak5wU0t4em5vRW5OQTFXUGpIXzZueXc5MnczcmdtYVE2aVRVaGZnYVdVV1JCSm9SQjFvVFVR</guid></item><item><title>Woman Dismissed By Doctors After Regular Fainting Had POTS - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc0g2N2g4X3FvU3pTQVNGV3Y4N2Vqa1E4OThzeGJySTJ0OEZiWTFadFJ1cDV5Yk9PZnVwNWRoeU5IeFQyMmlnalVfZ28zeHcyZk5lV1Z4c2d6eWtSZ3JvVFJjTjB6ZmE1S1U2bEE0NXgwZS0tb09LZ01rQTZub044Umt5UGXSAVRBVV95cUxNZWRWa2M4MHlYaXRWOVpCeUtDRjJoMnZmQTR0RlhqQTF5TllGX1FZSzJBaHhic192SlJXNGxHUjZSbFppSUtIcW9RV3pvbzJPTDVmd08?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two days after running a marathon Catrina Vargo, then 32, was walking through her living room when she fainted. The next thing she remembers is waking on the couch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I didn’t even know what had just happened,” Vargo, 35, of Pittsburgh, tells TODAY.com. “I talked to a couple of friends in medicine. I went to urgent care. Every single person said the same thing. ‘You just ran a marathon. Your body’s probably tired.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Though she rested, as the doctors recommended, she continued fainting so frequently that it disrupted her life. She visited specialist after specialist and received no answers for why she felt unwell. Eventually, she was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more commonly known as POTS, which can cause fainting and a racing heartbeats when a person changes position from sitting to standing, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I certainly had a lot of specialists tell me this might be my new normal now,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Fainting and weakness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When Vargo ran the 2022 Pittsburgh Marathon in early May, something felt off for the lifelong runner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I ended up walking for a little bit,” she says. “It felt like there was no gas in the tank if that makes sense.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two days later, she fainted for the first time. At first, it seemed as if she was worn down from the marathon. But then she fainted in a store. She visited the emergency room to try to understand why and doctors told her she was fine and she was “probably still recovering.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors said, “Nothing is worrisome. Your heart looks fine. Your vitals look fine. Just go home and rest,” she recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Shortly after running the 2022 Pittsburgh Marathon, the third one she completed, Catrina Vargo kept fainting and felt exhausted. Doctors told her that she just needed to rest, but she later learned she had POTS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; Vargo felt OK for a few days, then fainted again. By the end of May, she felt so exhausted that she struggled to complete daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I couldn’t walk, couldn’t lift my head. I couldn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t drive a car,” she says. “I couldn’t work. I couldn’t even sit up in the chair and it was like I had lost all of my function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When Vargo visited doctors, though, they told her there was nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had probably seen like five or six different ER doctors, specialists, my PCP and everyone kept saying everything was OK,” she recalls. “That was very confusing because … something was obviously wrong. We have no answers but everyone’s telling me, 'Go home and hopefully this gets better.'” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By June, Vargo needed a wheelchair to help her get around. Frustrated, she wondered if life would always be like this for her now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Each doctor would say, ‘I’m not getting the answers for you. So good luck. Hopefully, you’ll find another specialist that finds the answers,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, a doctor suggested she undergo a tilt table test, which often helps doctors determine the underlying cause of fainting. It works by moving a person on a table to see if different positions cause blacking out. While the test provided some answers, Vargo still faced uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They were at least able to say something’s happening in your body that’s causing you to faint, and we have proof that it’s happening,” Vargo says. “But they still weren’t able to say for sure what it was.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Around the same time, some of her friends working in medicine mentioned POTS. That prompted her to make an appointment with a cardiologist familiar with POTS. While she waited for that appointment, she struggled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m not walking,” Vargo says. “I can’t really do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Even making it to the appointment in July 2022 was difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was wholly in a wheelchair,” she says. “I had to get help to get to the clinic and get help getting out of the wheelchair.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor determined she had POTS from being “pretty depleted from a lot of nutrients.” Running a marathon stressed her body even more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My nervous system was already not in a great place,” she says. “I basically pushed my body to the limit where my nervous system almost reprogrammed itself to be dysfunctional.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor prescribed a medication that raised her blood pressure to address her blood pressure dipping “significantly” when she stood. But she also started participating in an exercise program that helps POTS patients manage the fainting and weakness they experience. Vargo dedicated herself to it and about a year later, she started feeling more like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s definitely been a journey,” she says. “I’ll be honest there are some days I can still feel off depending on my stress levels or if I haven’t hydrated (well) that day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;POTS and exercise &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People with POTS experience “an exaggerated increase in heart rate” when changing positions such as moving from sitting to standing, Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist with Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, told TODAY.com via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This can be accompanied by an uncomfortable awareness of the accelerated heartbeat (palpitations) or lightheadedness,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other symptoms can include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An inability to work out also known as exercise intolerance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort in the chest &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People experience POTS differently with some reporting minor symptoms while others find that “symptoms can be disabling, preventing full participation in work and activities of daily living,” says Tomey, who did not treat Vargo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts believe the condition occurs when the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system fail to work together harmoniously. Still, doctors are investigating why it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The exact mechanism of its pathogenesis (remains) incompletely understood,” Tomey says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While people who experience conditions such as long COVID might also have POTS, Tomey notes it can also appear without a concurrent condition. There’s not one treatment that works universally and doctors often tailor therapies to address each patient. Treatments could include medication, wearing compression garments, focusing on hydration and sodium intake to balance electrolytes and participating in a specialized exercise regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The exercise program has several names, including the Levine protocol and the Dallas protocol. It works by slowly increasing one’s endurance to exercise by focusing on boosting the cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When (these patients are) standing up, they don’t feel good, they’re getting dizzy, they’re lightheaded. Worst case, they’re passing out … A lot of that is because they don’t have enough blood volume getting into their brains,” Mark Jordan, senior clinical exercise physiologist for the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation institute at UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What exercise could do for you is to help expand the biggest chamber of your heart to allow your body to pump more blood out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After a year of physical therapy and some treatments to deal with anemia, Catrina Vargo started feeling like herself following her POTS diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time exercise increases blood flow, it helps train the autonomic nervous system to work properly. When healthy people stand, the autonomic nervous system makes sure the blood flows to the brain so the body can work as it should. In POTS, people experience a disruption to that, causing lightheadedness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Levine or Dallas Protocol encourages people to participate in “exercise where you’re sitting down and your feet are in front of you,” what’s also known as recumbent exercise, Jordan says. Often patients start with a rowing machine or recumbent bike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They don’t feel good when they’re upright so we’re not going to do any exercise while they’re upright,” he explains. “We start with short almost moderate-intensity interval training.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo says when she first began, she would row until she felt like she might faint or for about seven minutes. It’s typical for people with POTS to start exercising for short bursts of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s very very low level moderate intense recumbent exercise with a slow progression over the course of … months,” Jordan says. “It’s going to take at least a couple of months before you might start to notice improvement and it could take six months to a year of consistent exercise to really feel better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People slowly find they can row or bike for longer amounts of time. When they feel like they have improved endurance, they can move on to other forms of exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’ll gradually progress you from a recumbent exercise to an upright bike to ultimately fully upright walking or running on a treadmill,” Jordan explains. “Once you get to that point and you’re able to do upright exercise, feeling well, I encourage patients to do what they want.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If a patient finds that their symptoms return, they can always return to the program, starting with recumbent activity and working up to upright exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They could use it indefinitely … as a guide to know where to start and how to progress,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘A balancing act’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About a year after starting physical therapy, Vargo began feeling better. Her doctor noticed her iron levels remained low, and she started receiving injections, which also helped her feel more like herself again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ever since then it’s been a balance act,” she says. “I need to keep an eye on (my health) and make sure I don’t get lazy with taking care of my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo has been able to start running again but she often focuses on activities such as Pilates, yoga, spinning and softball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news is I can push my body back to regular exercise limits, doing exercise five days a week, and can comfortably do that with little issue,” she says. “I’m very grateful to just be able to be back to my life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She empathizes with people longing for a diagnosis with a “mystery illness” and encourages them to continue to seek help for their health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You have to be your own advocate and while that can be really scary and really tiring if you keep searching and calling and making appointments and talking to your network like I was eventually you are able to find people who really care,” she says. “Just keep advocating for yourself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo wanted to share her story to offer hope to others with POTS. The diagnosis can feel very overwhelming especially because it can feel like there are few options for recovering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;While she hasn't signed up to run a marathon since her POTS diagnosis, Catrina Vargo has been able to run again thanks to her dedication to physical therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There (are) no stories of people that went through hell and back but now they’re back to living a normal life,” she says. “I always told myself if, when, I recover I want to make sure that a positive story is out there so people don’t give up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:23:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc0g2N2g4X3FvU3pTQVNGV3Y4N2Vqa1E4OThzeGJySTJ0OEZiWTFadFJ1cDV5Yk9PZnVwNWRoeU5IeFQyMmlnalVfZ28zeHcyZk5lV1Z4c2d6eWtSZ3JvVFJjTjB6ZmE1S1U2bEE0NXgwZS0tb09LZ01rQTZub044Umt5UGXSAVRBVV95cUxNZWRWa2M4MHlYaXRWOVpCeUtDRjJoMnZmQTR0RlhqQTF5TllGX1FZSzJBaHhic192SlJXNGxHUjZSbFppSUtIcW9RV3pvbzJPTDVmd08</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases in Texas outbreak surpass 500, with 24 new infections confirmed over last 5 days - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQWkphN3c2OW1tZXpjdC0ydjVuRzlEaWZTVVE5SHh0bHpQT2RvQzh0QUtoWkhjVzNnVGNqRzFDMVVmcm5ZNHdfRm5zcFlHVEY4bUQ1QjJ0Z3V0WE1ac1FsUVpEY1NEcUlqZ2s2eHNGdF80QjFuZ2djcDJhSTZXWWsxR214bEtZTmFtOWtBMzRIOEpCdzlBR2RscjV6YVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The measles outbreak in western Texas is continuing to grow, with 24 new cases confirmed over the last five days, according to data published Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; (DSHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Three of the 505 cases are among residents who have been vaccinated with one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

			&lt;p&gt;Finding a special soulmate and tying the knot is, of course, cause for celebration, but new research highlights a surprising potential downside of getting married: it may significantly increase your &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings unexpected is that many previous studies have shown a variety of health benefits to getting married – benefits that include &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/104/23/1937"&gt;lower heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1047-2797(99)00052-6"&gt;living to an older age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the latest study, led by researchers from the Florida State University College of Medicine, suggests further investigations will be needed into the reasons why single people may be less likely to get dementia – or perhaps are less likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-could-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt;have it diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157429" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty.jpg" alt="Wedding party" class="wp-image-157429 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157429" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study challenges previous research into marriage and health. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/people-standing-and-sitting-on-chair-during-daytime-lKCpUYu2TDk"&gt;Carlo Buttinoni/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70072"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the stats: the researchers looked at the health records of 24,107 elderly people (with an average age of 71.8 years), across the course of 18 years. These people were split into four groups: married, widowed, divorced, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-a-dangerous-bias-against-single-people-in-cancer-treatment"&gt;never married&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With risk adjustments only for age and sex, individuals who had never married were 40 percent less likely to develop dementia than married people. For those who had been widowed, the drop was 27 percent, and for those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/children-of-divorce-face-greater-risk-of-future-stroke-study-reveals"&gt;were divorced&lt;/a&gt;, it was 34 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After factoring in more variables, like education, genetics, and other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, the statistical difference for widowed people went away. However, there was still a 24 percent lower risk for never married people, and 17 percent for those who were divorced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that some of the discrepancies here are due to factors that aren't related to marital status – and so this isn't proof of direct cause and effect. That said, there's still a noticeable difference in risk for those who have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-it-s-better-to-be-single-according-to-science"&gt;stayed single&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this association are likely to be many and varied. The researchers suggest single people might be better at keeping up social ties that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;ward off dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while the health impacts &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stressful-life-events-linked-to-alzheimers-biomarkers-study-finds"&gt;of unhappy marriages&lt;/a&gt; should also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is some evidence indicating an increase in some domains of well-being, such as happiness and life satisfaction, after divorce and social participation after partner bereavement," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70072"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Never married individuals are also more likely to socialize with friends and neighbors and are more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than their married counterparts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth acknowledging that other studies have shown that being married may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-never-marry-42-higher-risk-of-developing-dementia-single-health"&gt;protect against dementia&lt;/a&gt; – so why the confusion? Variations in the size and diversity of samples, as well as accommodations for different risk factors, might help explain it, but this is clearly a complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.30.25321421v3"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Cleveland Clinic on the effectiveness of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine shows that those who took the shot had a 27 percent higher risk of infection compared to those who skipped the jab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to public health assurances — not to mention the advice of doctors and TV ads by large pharmaceutical companies — the findings suggest the vaccine may not only lack effectiveness but could actually increase the risk of influenza infection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Dr. Nabin Shrestha, analyzed data from more than 53,000 employees in Cleveland Clinic’s Ohio facilities during the 2024–2025 respiratory viral season. The goal was to evaluate the vaccine’s real-world performance in protecting against laboratory-confirmed influenza. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants included relatively healthy, working-age adults, offering a focused lens on vaccine impact in a healthcare setting. Of the employees analyzed, 82.1 percent received the influenza vaccine. However, the study found that the cumulative incidence of influenza infections was higher in vaccinated individuals compared to those unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the 25-week study period, 1,079 confirmed cases of influenza — primarily caused by influenza A — were recorded. In the study’s medical language, the researchers wrote: “In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95 percent C.I., 1.07 – 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of −26.9 percent (95 percent C.I., −55.0 to −6.6 percent).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means vaccinated individuals had a 27 percent higher risk of infection compared to unvaccinated employees. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shrestha and his team emphasized that these findings could not be dismissed as a statistical anomaly. The analysis, enriched through time-dependent methods and adjusted models, consistently showed this troubling pattern. “No protective effect emerged at any point,” the &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/landmark-cleveland-clinic-study-finds-flu-vaccine-ineffectiveand-possibly-harmfulfor-working-adults-in-2024-2025-season-84b3b608"&gt;researchers noted&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study raises critical questions about this year’s flu vaccine formulation, including the possibility of “strain mismatches” and immune interference. It also challenges broader public health messaging about the benefits of the annual flu vaccine, particularly in years of poor strain selection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The negative vaccine effectiveness figure — suggesting harm rather than protection — contradicts public health messaging and raises serious questions about strain mismatch, immune interference, or potential vaccine-related susceptibility,” the &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/landmark-cleveland-clinic-study-finds-flu-vaccine-ineffectiveand-possibly-harmfulfor-working-adults-in-2024-2025-season-84b3b608"&gt;researchers said&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the study does have limitations, the researchers noted. It focused exclusively on the inactivated trivalent flu vaccine, which accounted for 99 percent of the vaccinations among participants. The effectiveness of alternative options such as quadrivalent or live-attenuated vaccines was not analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, flu-related hospitalizations or deaths were too infrequent to assess, and the study could not capture cases diagnosed outside the Cleveland Clinic system.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, Dr. Shrestha said, “The data were robust enough to reject the common defense that odds ratios from ‘test-negative’ studies exaggerate protection—because here, direct risk was measured.”  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz1qj001h3b73oa6gycdr@published"&gt;I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost three years. We have an age difference (he’s 46, I’m 30). I love him dearly. He has OCD and is very big on his routines. Everything has a routine. He does not handle variation from the regular daily schedule very well. In all other aspects of our life, I’m totally fine with conforming to his needs—they benefit me 90 percent of the time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98qp6gq00063b73xc2buf9f@published"&gt;But I think our sex life is just OK. It’s not bad, but it’s the same every time. It’s the same dirty talk, same actions, same outcome. I like it, but I really crave more variety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz1uo001j3b73nd6n245n@published"&gt;I don’t know how to bring this up to him, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life having the same exact sexual experience every time. I don’t want him to feel like I don’t understand or appreciate his OCD, but I’m not entirely sure if my problem stems from his need to follow routines or if it’s simply just how he likes to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this a dealbreaker for you? Or do you value the rest of the relationship highly enough that the repetitive nature of your sex is, while undesirable, something you can tolerate? This might come up when the two of you start discussing the subject, so it’s best to do the introspection now.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="174" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz220001n3b73qzsw64ze@published"&gt;It’s also worth considering whether your stance differs depending on whether this is a personal preference of his or a manifestation of the OCD he experiences, since the end of your letter indicates this might be the case. Think about whether the reason changes anything, and, if so, why that is. Because the “why” seems to hold weight for you, I’d broach the subject of variety in sex with a question: ”I’ve been wondering about the way we have sex. Is the consistent routine a preference of yours or does it have something to do with the way OCD affects you?” As always, choose your time well, and make sure you have the emotional reserves to deal with any hard feelings that come up for either of you. Once you’ve asked your question, listen to what he says. Take into account the fact that sometimes many of us struggle to really know the answer to something like this at first, so be patient if he’s contradictory or needs to revisit the subject later on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz23g001o3b73if4xonsi@published"&gt;While you’re working through that big discussion, I’m wondering whether you can meet your desire for variety through masturbation. When you’re alone, you can absolutely change things up through different ways of stimulating yourself, fantasies, and any other variable you can think of. This might provide a way to let some steam off while the two of you work on variety when you’re together, or as an outlet long-term if he’s unable or unwilling to experiment and you decide you want to stay in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98ozeaa00283b73bzvyz48o@published"&gt;I’ve always been a free-spirited guy, and I don’t really know how I ended up married, especially to a prudish woman. Our sex life reduced a lot in the past few years, until I felt like my wife was just giving me boring maintenance sex three times a week and always claiming she was too tired or didn’t have the energy for anything kinkier or more exciting. We have three toddlers, so I didn’t want to mess up our family, and I decided to quietly take matters into my own hands. This fall, I discreetly started seeing a female friend a few nights a week. She knew I was involved in a marriage that didn’t sexually fulfill me, and I was able to enjoy sex with a true spark; plus, getting my needs met helped me become a better and more patient husband. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/girlfriend-told-wife-about-affair-advice.html"&gt;Unfortunately, my girlfriend told my wife.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The case for Ozempic as a dementia buster is building. Research published this week has found that GLP-1 drugs are associated with a lower risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Ireland led the study, a review of the existing evidence. Compared to controls (like other forms of medication or a placebo), people on GLP-1 therapy were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with dementia, the researchers found. Other scientists and pharmaceutical companies have already begun to test these drugs in clinical trials for dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy, and similar drugs&lt;/a&gt; mimic the hormone GLP-1, which helps regulate our blood sugar and appetite (the drugs are made with the active ingredient semaglutide). These drugs were first approved to lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes, but are now commonly also used to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with poorly controlled diabetes are at higher risk for Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, and recent clinical trials have additionally shown that GLP-1 therapy can &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;reduce the odds&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease, another risk factor for dementia. But according to the researchers behind the new study, there has been a “lack of robust evidence” supporting the use of heart-protective, glucose-lowering drugs like GLP-1s to prevent dementia in people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 23 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of GLP-1 drugs and other glucose-lowering medications like SGLT2is. These trials involved roughly 160,000 volunteers and explicitly tracked whether anyone developed dementia or cognitive impairment during the study period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team failed to find a link between the overall use of these drugs and a lower risk of dementia or cognitive impairment compared to controls. But when they looked at drug classes separately, they found that GLP-1 drugs did appear to stand out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is or pioglitazone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings are not the first to suggest a potential dementia-buffering effect from GLP-1 therapy. A study &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.089799"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this January, for instance, found some evidence that liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) could reduce the rate of brain shrinkage in people with Alzheimer’s (Gizmodo &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ozempics-older-sibling-might-slow-down-alzheimers-2000482645"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; the study last year when its preliminary results were first disclosed). Another review &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38746639/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last year also concluded that GLP-1 drugs may have possible “metabolic and neuroprotective benefits” in people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly clear how GLP-1s might protect the brains of people with early dementia or at higher risk for it, though some scientists have speculated that these drugs may reduce inflammation or improve how our brain cells communicate. It also remains to be seen how impactful this protective effect will really be, if it is genuine. But bolstered by the early data, Novo Nordisk, the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy, have &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=39097"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; two large-scale phase III trials testing semaglutide for people with early Alzheimer’s disease, which are expected to wrap up next year. So soon enough, we’ll hopefully have some concrete answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Residents now have quick access to life-saving medications thanks to harm reduction vending machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new effort by Dane County, SSM Health, UW Health, and UW-Madison aims to increase access to naloxone and other items that can help prevent or treat a potentially fatal overdose. this initiative involves the placement of harm reduction vending machines outside two hospitals in the community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dane County is committed to saving lives and addressing the opioid epidemic with compassion, urgency, and evidence-based solutions," said Dane County Executive Melissa Agard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machines which offer supplies at no cost, are stocked with items that include doses of naloxone (nasal spray and injection), fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, menstrual kits, and other harm reduction materials. The vending machines are located outside of SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital at the corner of S. Park Street, and Erin Street., and the UW Health University Hospital emergency department at 600 Highland Ave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of overdose deaths in Dane County from 2020, led by Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County, found that 45% of people who died from an overdose had an emergency department visit within the year before their fatal overdose. Of those visits, 24% were for a non-fatal overdose and 34% occurred within 30 days of their death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dane County Emergency Management analyzed data provided by similar vending machine programs, along with ambulance run reports to identify types of harm reduction materials that would benefit the community. The department also applied for a grant administered by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services using opioid settlement funds to support the purchase of the machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machines will be monitored and restocked by emergency management staff, in partnership with Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Cognitive shuffling, a technique developed by cognitive scientist Dr. Luc Beaudoin, helps quiet racing thoughts for better sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The method involves mentally conjuring random, non-emotionally charged words and corresponding images for each letter.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Though research is limited, the technique mimics natural sleep onset when the brain experiences fragmented thought patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Practitioners typically report falling asleep within five to 15 minutes while using this mental distraction method.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Experts emphasize cognitive shuffling is not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or treatment for sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;

            When Dr. Luc Beaudoin was an undergraduate student nearly 40 years ago, he often had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/health/insomnia-what-to-do-wellness/index.html"&gt;trouble falling asleep&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday nights and was eager to find a solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms00083b6m2kte43w8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He found inspiration in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;a cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt; class he was taking and &lt;a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/22392" target="_blank"&gt;a professor’s theory&lt;/a&gt; regarding visual motion detection, Beaudoin, now a cognitive scientist, said. Visual motion detection refers to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the visual system’s ability to perceive and process motion based on changing patterns of light on the retina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms00093b6mon5p9roq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought to myself: If I can understand the human brain’s ‘sleep onset control system,’ I could perhaps devise a technique to trick the brain into falling asleep,” Beaudoin, who is also an adjunct professor of education at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said via email. That technique was cemented as “cognitive shuffling” by 2009, when he was 41 and experiencing another bout of difficulty initially falling asleep or falling back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000a3b6mmknt2rf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My insomnia went away,” Beaudoin said. “My girlfriend (now my wife) was amazed that I would fall asleep so quickly. I felt I was onto something important. So, I read more extensively and thought deeply about the sleep onset control system.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000b3b6myb7b1pij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive shuffling typically involves mentally conjuring up random, impersonal and non-emotionally charged words. For each letter of a word you pick at random, you think of as many corresponding words as you can for five to eight seconds each before moving to the next letter, Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000c3b6mfd6p68ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the word “piano,” for example, you might think “Pear, parachute, Paul, pirouette … Item, intention, immature, igloo …” and so on. (Beaudoin is also an owner of CogZest and a cofounder of CogSci Apps Corp. and Somnolence+ Inc., all of which develop products based on his research.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000e3b6mhs53ulhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the technique may not sound calming, it “takes your mind off of your problems and your issues, and helps you get into a more relaxed state of mind,” said Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine physician and neurologist at the Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000f3b6mr3q3axxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I always tell patients, ‘You cannot force yourself to sleep. You have to allow yourself to sleep.’ And this is just one of the methods that we use to help with that,” added Abbasi-Feinberg, who often suggests the technique for her patients having sleep issues.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Sometimes you can even visualize corresponding scenarios or movements, such as yourself playing the piano or someone falling with a parachute, Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Here’s the science behind cognitive shuffling, and what to know about practicing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            At this point, there’s little research on cognitive shuffling. So what makes some doctors back a do-it-yourself sleep hack without substantial evidence?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000j3b6m8qcbcksu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turns out that the fundamental theory behind cognitive shuffling, though conjectural, “aligns with established principles in cognitive neuroscience and sleep psychology,” Dr. Leah Kaylor, a clinical psychologist and author based in Louisiana, said via email. It’s based on a large number of studies Beaudoin and other researchers reviewed in a paper published April 2020 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079219302217" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000l3b6mzxenhvrk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to taking the mind off one’s worries, cognitive shuffling “resembles in critical respects natural sleep onset,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000m3b6m2cxw2cy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the natural transition into sleep, people tend to have “microdreams” and fragmented, nonlinear thought patterns, Beaudoin and Kaylor said. Intentionally engaging in random, disconnected thinking may replicate this cognitive presleep state, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264574" target="_blank"&gt;helping people fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000n3b6m8k774cjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think there’s a positive feedback loop in the brain: Microdreams are not just a product of falling asleep; they cue the brain that it is safe and appropriate to fall asleep,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000o3b6mp0pbg0ic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since our brains tend to “shuffle” between random thoughts during quieter periods, giving our brains a calming or neutral distraction can be more helpful than allowing them to find something on their own, Dr. Kami McManus, a sleep psychologist in the department of sleep medicine at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, said via email.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000p3b6m6ax26gf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beaudoin published &lt;a href="https://summit.sfu.ca/item/16196" target="_blank"&gt;his third study&lt;/a&gt; on cognitive shuffling in 2016. The study’s sample size was small, but its findings were encouraging: 154 college students, most of them female, were randomly assigned to a standard treatment done before bedtime, to practicing a cognitive shuffling exercise more formally known as a serial diverse imagining task (SDIT), or to both.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000q3b6mg4fdaep9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the SDIT group, an app randomly presented recordings of words one at a time with eight-second intervals in between, during which participants created and maintained an image of the word until the next recording prompted the next image and so on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000r3b6mc9xzbwfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SDIT group were more likely to experience improvements in sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2603482/" target="_blank"&gt;presleep arousal&lt;/a&gt; — heightened physical or mental activity while trying to fall asleep. These benefits lasted throughout the semester.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000s3b6mltuncbv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beaudoin and his team are planning additional research, this time comparing cognitive shuffling to other mental visualization and cognitive techniques.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000t3b6m0rrwa0ep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To practice cognitive shuffling, there isn’t a set number of words or amount of time required. The words you choose for each letter also don’t have to be logically related, Kaylor said — trying to control the randomness will reduce the technique’s effectiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000u3b6m6evsxta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People typically report falling asleep within around five to 15 minutes, while others may take longer, especially if they’re highly stressed or prone to overthinking, Kaylor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000v3b6mt4knhseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you find yourself engaged in the technique for more than 20 minutes or starting to feel frustrated, it’s best to give up and get out of bed, McManus said. Your body may not be ready, so doing a calming activity elsewhere for 20 to 30 minutes before going back to bed and trying again is better than trying too hard and activating negative emotions, making sleep more difficult.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000w3b6m9lgrqmal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try this technique several nights in a row before you decide whether cognitive shuffling works for you, these experts recommended. However, remember that it’s not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or a cure for a sleep condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000x3b6m7z7p91qj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If someone drinks a lot of coffee before bed, they shouldn’t expect cognitive techniques to help them fall asleep,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000y3b6mnkhwpayr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, you should still ensure you have regular sleep and wake times; a bedtime routine involving other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/health/4-7-8-breathing-technique-relaxing-wellness/index.html"&gt;wind-down habits&lt;/a&gt; such as journaling or taking a warm shower; a quiet, dark and cool room; limited screen time before bed; and no alcohol in the few hours before sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000z3b6m9k73vmny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you regularly have problems sleeping, Beaudoin emphasized that cognitive techniques in general aren’t replacements for medical advice. They’re also not substitutes for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/c/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-insomnia/procedures.html" target="_blank"&gt;known as CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, as many cases of insomnia have more than one element in need of treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral on Sunday, calling it “a heartbreaking day” in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;a post on X&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has a long history of spreading misinformation about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and has spent much of the current outbreak attempting to &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rfk-downplays-texas-measles-outbreak-after-first-death.html"&gt;downplay the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the situation and promoting &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;dangerous and unproven alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt;. But apparently, he found the weekend’s events sobering enough to share some evidence-based information about how to avoid preventable deaths of children. “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm98n5xq0000z3b742eux8ctn@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;This common-sense public-health advice did not go over well with RFK Jr.’s anti-vaxx fan base, who sounded off in the comments, calling him a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/HerbsandDirt/status/1909060422596251991"&gt;sell-out&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://x.com/TPV_John/status/1909035737841819726"&gt;a really great poster boy for Big Pharma.&lt;/a&gt;” Others responded with &lt;a href="https://x.com/chrismartenson/status/1909188914239111546"&gt;variations&lt;/a&gt; of “&lt;a href="https://x.com/FiveTimesAugust/status/1908998847902126400"&gt;WTF&lt;/a&gt;” as well as genuine confusion, noting correctly that Children’s Health Defense — the aggressively anti-vaxx nonprofit RFK Jr. founded — “&lt;a href="https://x.com/lisaflora98/status/1908971568824197127"&gt;promotes the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.” “Can someone find @RobertKennedyJr and put him in as @HHSGov secretary please” &lt;a href="https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1909199207128576174"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; one user, while others speculated that their leader had been “&lt;a href="https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1896763006115262838"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;” or was being “&lt;a href="https://x.com/beverly_patriot/status/1909175209245942161"&gt;blackmailed&lt;/a&gt;.” Del Bigtree, the CEO of the anti-vaxx organization Informed Consent Action Network — and a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-hires-del-bigtree-anti-vaccine-activist-communications-director-rcna131859"&gt;former communications director&lt;/a&gt; for RFK Jr.’s presidential campaign — &lt;a href="https://x.com/delbigtree/status/1909082009185779980"&gt;expressed outrage&lt;/a&gt; that RFK Jr.’s post failed to mention the conspiracy that “the MMR is also one of the most effective ways to cause autism.” Other disillusioned followers took it upon themselves to highlight RFK Jr.’s most galling instances of hypocrisy, resurfacing footage of him &lt;a href="https://x.com/TheRebelPatient/status/1909016685912240200"&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; getting measles as a child as “a great week” and &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1896763006115262838"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; without evidence that the MMR vaccine may kill more children than measles.&lt;/p&gt;

Following widespread criticism of his lackluster measles response, he published &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; with Fox News Digital, writing that “vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” In neither case has he explicitly urged parents to vaccinate their children — he called vaccination a “personal” decision in the Fox News piece — but plenty of his fans still weren’t thrilled. (Some did appreciate that he gave &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annarmatson/video/7477609869424545067"&gt;airtime to vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; can be dangerous in large doses in addition to being ineffective at preventing measles.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm98n5xve00113b74sto01vm9@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;But it’s increasingly hard to deny that RFK Jr.’s public statements about vaccines have been wildly inconsistent. After spending years &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html"&gt;profiting off lies about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, he attempted to reassure Americans last fall that he wouldn’t “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955"&gt;take away anyone’s vaccines&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearings-vaccines-abortion-pills-gender-affirming-care.html"&gt;repeatedly claimed&lt;/a&gt; to be “pro-vaccine” during his confirmation hearings. Yet despite his claims to want transparency and “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html"&gt;good science&lt;/a&gt;,” the FDA recently canceled &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/fda-flu-vaccine.html"&gt;a flu-vaccine planning meeting&lt;/a&gt; of scientific experts without giving any indication why. Meanwhile, RFK Jr. has tapped David Geier — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html"&gt;another notorious anti-vaxxer&lt;/a&gt; — to lead a study reexamining the already thoroughly debunked link between vaccines and autism, which even Republican senator Bill Cassidy has suggested is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/nih-hearing-jay-bhattacharya.html"&gt;a waste of time and money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there still needs to be considerable focus on further research with larger trials to clarify its efficacy and safety in managing ASD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-4154a0c0-1480-11f0-bdec-49040de85ba9" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data, one in 36 children in the US have autism - just under 2million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 2000s, this number was closer to one in 142. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear what exactly could be behind the rise, experts have blamed environmental exposures like pollution, as well as doctors getting better at spotting the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in marijuana, CBD does not cause a 'high' or sense of euphoria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CBD has been shown to improve conditions like epilepsy and other brain disorders, which experts suggest could be due to the same mechanism as treating autism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the review abstract, presented this week at the 2025 European Congress of Psychiatry, researchers analyzed three studies involving 276 total children and young adults with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants ranged from five to 21 years old, and the average age was 10. More than two-thirds of the participants were male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients received either a gradually increasing dose of CBD or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dosage started at one milligram per kilogram of body weight and gradually went up to 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CBD gummies sold in the US can contain anywhere from five to 120 milligrams per gummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear if the CBD was the same type sold at health stores in the US or if it was a specific medical grade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children and young adults taking CBD had 'significantly enhanced social responsiveness,' meaning they were better able to understand social cues and maintain conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants also had 'moderate' improvements in disruptive behaviors like tantrums and sleep and 'small yet notable reductions' in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These findings support the potential consideration of CBD cannabis extracts in ASD treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the review's limitations include a small number of studies, limited sample sizes, and significant heterogeneity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future research with larger, robust trials is needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of CBD cannabis extracts in managing ASD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows states that have medical cannabis programs in the US. Medical cannabis is legal in 47 states, Washington DC, and three territories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe CBD could lead to improvements in autistic behaviors by activating endocannabinoids, molecules that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, and immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could influence functions like mood, anxiety, metabolism, sleep, and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, a similar study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/17/6/686"&gt;Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; found CBD improved communication skills, attention, learning, eye contact, irritability, and overall quality of life in autistic people ages five to 18 after six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical cannabis is legal in 47 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While cannabis for medical use is legal in the UK with a prescription, it is a controlled substance and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, import, or export, according to the House of Commons Library.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and nausea from chemotherapy can &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6249029/Medical-cannabis-available-prescription-month.html"&gt;get a prescription for medical cannabis through the NHS.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Geert Dom, president of the European Psychiatric Association, said: 'ASD can be extremely frustrating for all involved; parents of children and adolescents with the disorder, the treating clinicians and of course the children and adolescents themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A large part of this frustration is down to finding a viable treatment option that works to reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is with delight that we see the results of this meta-analysis and we hope to see further research into this so we can move towards a solution to the unmet need within this community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between cannabis and autism is complicated and still not well understood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, some evidence suggests using cannabis during pregnancy may cause genetic changes in unborn babies, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13183003/using-weed-pregnancy-adhd-autism-rates-rising.html"&gt;increasing their risk of autism and ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, autism advocacy groups have said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

compared to evenly distributed activity, also referred to as the "weekend warrior" pattern, where most activity is completed in one to two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC recommends that adults get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the U.K. Biobank to look at participants' physical activity measurements from 2013 to 2015, with patterns including inactive, active, weekend warrior and active regular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within an eight-year follow-up, 3,965 participants died from all causes, 667 died from cardiovascular disease and 1,780 died &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"The study shows that getting any exercise is better than none, but weekend warriors should be cautious about injuries."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was "no discernible difference" in mortality risk between the "active regular" and "active weekends" groups, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/crunches-age-heres-how-many-you-should-able-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRUNCHES BY AGE: HERE'S HOW MANY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Engaging in [physical activity] concentrated within one to two days was related with a similar reduction in mortality risk as more evenly spread activity," the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings are particularly significant for individuals who find it challenging to engage in regular [physical activity] due to time constraints."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with time constraints can still reap the benefits of working out when time allows, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess Hiestand, training manager at Rumble Boxing in Los Angeles, shared her observation of the study results in an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The weekend warriors had a lower risk of death compared to those who were inactive, but the difference was small enough that it wasn’t statistically significant when compared to the ‘regularly active’ group," she mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it’s great that people who struggle to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fit in activity&lt;/a&gt; during the week can still see benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stay-fit-your-40s-beyond-smart-workout-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAY FIT IN YOUR 40S AND BEYOND WITH THESE SMART WORKOUT TIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercising can have a positive impact on the body regardless of frequency, Hiestand cast doubts that weekend warriors see similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on my observations with my clients, I doubt weekend warriors see the same benefits in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, healthy body composition and athletic performance as those who are active throughout the week," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One fitness trainer recommends strength training three times a week and at least 30 minutes of walking per day.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While my recommendations vary depending on a person’s goals, for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;general health&lt;/a&gt;, I typically recommend strength training three times a week. For cardio, I suggest a minimum of 30 minutes of walking daily (it doesn't necessarily need to be all at once)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who seek change in body composition or athletic improvement, Hiestand recommended increasing the duration or intensity of the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something is better than nothing, and if you truly can't meet the movement recommendations from doctors or trainers, start with what you can do," she said.

If left undiagnosed or untreated, CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation to save the life of the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your kidneys could be dying in silence and you might not even know it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per statistics, 1 in 10 people suffer from some kind of chronic kidney disease globally. It can occur at any age and several risk factors can trigger it. In India, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is 800 per 10 lakhs of people and the incidence of end-stage kidney disease is 200 per 10 lakhs and diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/10/02/Pictures/doctor-supports-kidneys-healthy_aa4678fc-c5f8-11e8-978e-6307977af0b0.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)" title="Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rising prevalence of CKD can be encountered with increasing awareness and understanding of kidney health and disease. Further, early detection is considered a vital tool in the drive to prevent serious complications of CKD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Chhya Vaja, Internal Medicine Expert at Apollo Spectra in Mumbai, shared, “Diabetes not only causes heart disease, nerve damage but even kidney problems. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) causing a loss of kidney function. Over time, high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter waste.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Start these kidney-saving habits today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk goes higher when diabetes is poorly managed. Dr Chhya Vaja explained that since CKD progresses silently without any symptoms in its early stages, many patients remain undiagnosed until severe kidney damage has occurred. Unmanaged blood sugar levels raise the risk of kidney disease. According to her, vital measures such as timely tests, blood sugar and blood pressure management, medication, a well-balanced diet and exercise can prevent CKD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/17/550x309/insulin_for_diabteic_kidney_disease_1742222593640_1742222617779.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="India’s diabetes crisis is fueling kidney failure.

Here’s how to protect yourself.(Image by Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about analysing whether your kidneys are functioning properly or not, Dr Bharat Shah, Director of Renal Science at Gleneagles Hospital in Mumbai's Parel, suggested, “There are three important steps to determine this, which include three tests: a urine test, serum creatinine test, and sonography. Doing these tests once a year provides valuable information about kidney function and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Obesity in children can also lead to kidney disease in the future so, it is crucial to teach them the importance of weight control, healthy eating habits and regular exercise from an early age. Additionally, the unnecessary use of painkillers, self-medication and delayed treatment of autoimmune diseases can have adverse effects on kidney health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This is significant because the hippocampus is among the first regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a technique that measures tissue stiffness, scientists scanned the brains of young adults and found that only the hippocampus showed this link between blood flow and stiffness. These findings may help pave the way for earlier detection of Alzheimer’s disease by identifying brain changes before memory loss begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; MRE allows precise measurement of brain tissue stiffness and vascular influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampus Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased blood flow causes stiffness specifically in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain stiffness may be an early marker of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME researchers have discovered that increased blood flow leads to stiffness in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays important roles in learning and memory. The hippocampus is one of the first areas in the brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that erodes memory and thinking skills, as well as the ability to do daily tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we found that better blood flow makes the hippocampus area stiffer,” says ME Associate Professor Mehmet Kurt, the director of Kurtlab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108483"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Using factors like blood flow and stiffness components to quantify brain health could help lead to earlier detection of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, which currently has no cure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research suggests that one of the factors impacting hippocampus health might be reduced blood flow. This discovery opens up new potential ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s before memory loss occurs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UW Center for Human Neuroscience and at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, researchers scanned the brains of 17 volunteers between the ages of 22 and 35 using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). MRE, which combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with sound waves, provides researchers with information to create detailed images of varying levels of stiffness in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to find out how blood flow could potentially affect brain stiffness through MRE,”  says ME Ph.D. student Caitlin Neher, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is only part of the brain that shows this relationship between blood flow and stiffness. This may be because the hippocampus is a region with strong metabolic demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using factors like blood flow and stiffness components to quantify brain health could help lead to earlier detection of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, which currently has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies reveal that people with Alzheimer’s show softening in the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that in early Alzheimer’s, a reduction in blood flow could lead to this change in the brain, Neher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study focused on the basic science question of how blood flow and brain stiffness are related,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting to eventually apply this to a patient population by collaborating with UW Medicine. We want to better understand this link between brain stiffness and blood flow, and come up with diagnostic criteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mehmet Kurt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mehmet Kurt – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsfs.2024.0051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Perfusion–mechanics coupling of the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;” by Mehmet Kurt et al. &lt;em&gt;Interface Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfusion–mechanics coupling of the hippocampus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a highly scrutinized brain structure due to its entanglement in multiple neuropathologies and vulnerability to metabolic insults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to non-invasively assess the perfusion–mechanics relationship of the hippocampus in the healthy brain across magnetic resonance imaging sequences and magnetic field strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 17 subjects (aged 22–35, 7 males/10 females) were scanned with magnetic resonance elastography and arterial spin labelling acquisitions at 3T and 7T in a baseline physiological state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in perfusion or stiffness were observed across magnetic field strengths or acquisitions. The hippocampus had the highest vascularity within the deep grey matter, followed closely by the caudate nucleus and putamen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered a positive perfusion–mechanics correlation in the hippocampus across both 3T and 7T groups, with a highly significant correlation overall (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; = 0.71, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0019), which was not observed in the caudate nucleus, a similarly vascular region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we supported our hypothesis that increased perfusion in the hippocampus would lead to greater pulsatile displacement in a small cohort (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the hippocampus is an exceptionally vulnerable structure, with perfusion deficits often seen in diseases related to learning and memory, our results suggest a unique mechanistic link between metabolic health and stiffness biomarkers in this key region for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:59:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9JTnVSLTQzY3h5MFZSZFN0YjJuREI3TDhLcnZyaVhoa0dSWkoxQTRBd09tMlMxcGNEWjFEbVdNOXg2dFN6YXU5WjI2X2VwMV8tZG9LNi1xYS1BeW80NzNsM3ROVDdkZXpQRm1FYmlUVQ</guid></item><item><title>I Was Caring For A Patient With Down Syndrome.

You were &lt;em&gt;so kind &lt;/em&gt;to that little boy!” a pediatric resident told me with a saccharine and insincere tone. I was a third-year medical student, and she’d pulled me aside after she’d witnessed me giggling and zipping trucks along bedrails with a patient. I was also a 25-year-old woman who lacked a professional filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why wouldn’t I be kind?” I blurted out. My voice mirrored my grandmother’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember if the child was experiencing a specific ailment commonly coupled with his Down syndrome, such as leukemia or a structural heart or digestive condition, or if he was hospitalized for a typical pediatric problem like asthma, appendicitis or some accidental injury. What I remember is the resident’s eyebrows arching and her lips pursing. I realized too late she’d expected me to just say “thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trained my eyes on the tiny plastic frog dangling from her stethoscope. The amphibious toy meant to distract children while she auscultated their hearts and lungs couldn’t distract me from the sound of my pounding heart. We stood silently facing each other in the hospital corridor, until I heard the little boy’s Tonka truck clank to the floor. Saved by gravity, I pivoted back into his room to pick it up with echoes of my grandmother’s yelling buzzing in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years earlier, my grandmother Yetta reprimanded me and my cousin for tumbling headfirst down the half-flight of carpeted stairs in her split-level house, wearing the smocked Polly Flinders dresses she’d bought us. It would take me another 20 years to understand that my grandmother’s reprimands captured her purest expression of acceptance toward my cousin Becky, who has Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother’s words bit the air: “Rachel, Rebecca, stop it!” She was a staunch woman with curly jet-black hair who audited taxes for the IRS while raising three boys and running a luncheonette with my grandfather. She had zero tolerance for nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, Granny,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“OK, Ede,” Becky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of her grandchildren called her Granny, but not Becky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not Ede. Granny,” my grandmother would chide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, my cousin smiled. “No. Ede.” Becky never explained why she used this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And always, my grandmother smiled back. Their lighthearted refrain was a familiar script interjected between my grandmother’s complaints about the way my grandfather chewed everything he ate and how long it took him to do his daily crossword puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author in Lake George, New York, in 1980. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Charles Fleishman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was a year older than me. We spent our elementary school days playing hide-and-seek with our brothers, middle school swimming in her parents’ backyard pool, and high school changing into team swimsuits in our school locker room. My grandparents eventually moved to Florida while Becky and I were still waving hello to each other across our school cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Becky and I finished high school in the late ’90s, she moved to California with her mom and stepfather, and I moved to New York City for college and medical school. While I spent the bulk of my time in libraries, Becky completed vocational training and then worked at a bowling alley, and our grandmother discovered email. She sent Becky countless messages from her handle, GranEde, and Becky always replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t meant to be rude by rejecting the resident’s compliment, but my actions didn’t feel praiseworthy or even unusual. The world I knew before medical school was the one modeled by the adults who’d raised me. I’d always known that people with Down syndrome have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:distinct physical features;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;distinct physical features &lt;/a&gt;— what the medical literature calls “stigmata” — and a propensity for certain health conditions and disabilities, but I had never witnessed how they can be &lt;a href="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:subjected to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;subjected to&lt;/a&gt; harassment, humiliation, mistreatment and neglect, both in hospitals and outside them. I’d come to learn that “stigma,” a concept put &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forth by Erving Goffman;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;forth by Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt;, encompassed “disgrace attached to a particular condition or trait.” I’d never perceived Becky as stigmatized because our family did not isolate her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades after high school, Becky and I were mostly out of touch. I asked family members about her. I liked her Facebook posts. But my strongest connection to Becky was through my grandmother. When I flew to Florida for visits, my grandmother, in between digging through the sale rack at Bloomingdale’s and instructing the deli workers at Publix about the proper thickness of turkey breast slices, gave me the scoop on Becky. She told me about the races Becky swam in the Special Olympics and the volunteer work she did. And she told me, over and over, about the day she took Becky out for Chinese food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was in her late 20s at the time. My grandmother knew my cousin’s attitude about reading was inconsistent, but she refused to capitulate to Becky’s refusals. My grandmother handed her a menu. She waited. My cousin perused it and then announced to the waitress that she wanted “the happy family.” My grandmother, who once sat my father at the dinner table for hours because he refused to eat his peas, scoured the menu and discovered “the happy family” was a combination of several dishes, meant to serve six. She resigned herself to taking home leftovers because Becky had, after all, read the menu. Every time I heard this story, I believed my cousin picked “the happy family” not only because she wanted to eat what was in it, but because the words captured how she felt sitting in a sticky leather booth across from a woman who cherished her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author at Becky’s bat mitzvah. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was early in my residency the first time I cared for a baby diagnosed with Down syndrome after birth. Becky was not on my mind as I sat, silent, beside my neonatologist mentor while she told a husband and wife that their 1-hour-old child might have this genetic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenatal testing, which from the narrow perspective of a pediatrician affords parents the benefit of emotional, intellectual and medical preparation before their babies are born, had not flagged the possibility. Two teaspoons of blood drawn after the 10th week of pregnancy, known as “noninvasive prenatal testing,” identifies more than 99% of fetuses with Down syndrome. But this test wasn’t available back then, when a combination of first and second trimester blood tests and ultrasounds (still sometimes done today) &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:identified many but not all;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;identified many but not all&lt;/a&gt; fetuses with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was not on my mind as my mentor asked the baby’s name. I was transfixed by the way she spoke with purpose, and without judgment or pity — without implying Down syndrome was bad or tragic. She pointed out the physical features typical for Down syndrome and then asked the parents what they saw as we all peered at the baby’s face, hands and toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families receive medical information differently. Some families readily believe the impressions of a physician, some want confirmatory genetic testing before accepting this diagnosis, while still others need time to process before engaging in further dialogue with doctors. My mentor’s goal was to inform the family of the possibility that the child had Down syndrome, not to convince them she was right. The only urgency she had was to build trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation had been so honest, so compassionate, so pure, that I left the room enchanted with the spell of human connection. I’d never considered that, as a doctor, I could learn to cast sacred spells with words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so I became a neonatologist — in part because of that mentor and the glittering moment of truth she’d conveyed with raw kindness, and in part so I could chase the same sparkling connections with families navigating the delight of babies’ births while accepting their concomitant medical diagnoses. Most of my patients are either born prematurely or born on time but unexpectedly sick. Almost every day, I reassure families that neonatal intensive care is likely to allow their children to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1866, Dr. John Langdon Down published a medical paper whose now-offensive title, “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots&lt;/a&gt;,” obscures the importance of describing, and thereby lending medical legitimacy and attention to, human beings with Down syndrome. In 1959, not quite 20 years before Becky’s birth, the discovery that Down syndrome was caused by an extra 21st chromosome established the first link between an intellectual disability and genetics and paved the way for prenatal diagnostics. Since the 1970s, Down syndrome is &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasingly prevalent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increasingly prevalent&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, while rates have simultaneously declined in &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Europe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Down syndrome and counseling families remains a tiny part of my job. I’ve rolled stools beside new mothers during repeat C-sections to share what seemed possible. I’ve sat beside families that other doctors didn’t quite know how to approach and disclosed the truth myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time I have these high-stakes conversations, I roll my shoulders back, feel my sternum rise with my inhalations as I beckon reverence into these hospital rooms. I watch parental eyebrows and pupils and fingers clenching or unclenching as I utter measured words and allow conversations to bloom with unbridled parental emotion and exploratory questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I refrained from sharing stories about my cousin because Becky is only one person with a common condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;6 million people&lt;/a&gt; differently. I didn’t want to inject her life story into these families’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bernard Fleishman (Becky's grandpa, left), Becky Fleishman, and Yetta Fleishman (Becky's grandma) at Becky’s bat mitzvah &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was several years into my career as a neonatologist when my grandmother died and I lost my connection to Becky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky wasn’t at the funeral. No one quite knew how to tell her what had happened, and taking Becky across the country while everyone was grieving wasn’t feasible. My extended family shared stories of my grandmother. When it was my turn at the podium in that South Florida funeral home, I rambled, crying because I loved her for her freely expressed opinions. I mumbled about seagulls and almost sat down to sob into my husband’s blazer, when, from the depth of my grief, I shared an unscripted sentiment that sounds obvious only in hindsight: “How Granny treated Becky had a profound impact on me as a pediatrician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew home to Philadelphia at peace with my grief-stricken insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought to call Becky or ask how she’d taken the news about Ede. I mailed holiday cards from Philadelphia to San Diego every December. Some years, she mailed back photos of herself making scratch pizzas and pastries. When I saw Facebook photos of her 40th birthday at Disneyland, I was ecstatic. Mostly, though, Becky and I remained out of touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, three years after my grandmother died, I reconnected with Becky’s mom. Because of divorce and distance, I hadn’t spoken to my Aunt Sylvia since I was a teenager. I was struck, as I listened to her stories about Becky, by how much I missed my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To this day, Becky will tell you she doesn’t have Down syndrome,” my aunt told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This didn’t surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s because she was raised to believe she can do anything she wants,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a surprise,” my aunt explained. “The doctors told me lots of stuff that was just wrong.” They didn’t think Becky would breastfeed. They said she wouldn’t lift her head for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was appalled. I’ve cared for babies with Down syndrome with these challenges. But I’ve also cared for babies who did not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Becky was born, one of the doctors told us she belonged in an institution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what?!” I hadn’t known that. As a pediatrician, I couldn’t fathom advising parents to give away a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little I knew about institutions for disabled people I’d learned from watching Geraldo Rivera’s documentary “&lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace&lt;/a&gt;,” which came about after a doctor was fired from the &lt;a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/the-closing-of-willowbrook/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Willowbrook Developmental Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Willowbrook Developmental Center&lt;/a&gt; because he tried to champion humane care for the 5,230 people who lived there in the early ’70s. The &lt;a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/reform-and-closing-of-institutions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:movement to close these institutions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;movement to close these institutions&lt;/a&gt; was underway when Becky was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, what happened?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I called a pediatrician I already knew,” my aunt said — one who’d cared for Becky’s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited, mistakenly believing a pediatrician would be the hero in Becky’s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pediatrician told her that children with Down syndrome did not thrive in institutions. If Becky didn’t come home, he suggested adoption as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But your grandmother wouldn’t hear of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my eyes wrinkle and a flash of warmth. “What did she do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She marched into my hospital room,” my aunt recounted. “She said, ‘You’d bring a puppy home to be taken care of — she’s your daughter. You are bringing her home!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my grandmother. A firebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt gave me a gift that day. I hadn’t known I’d spent my career manifesting words uttered a year before I was born. I flashed back to countless babies’ bedsides, to families who held their children, desperate for them to get better, survive, go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it took, whatever their children needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What those families craved, all of them, was hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author (lower right) FaceTiming with Becky Fleishman (left) and her aunt Sylvia Ginsberg. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to think more about Becky when parents whose children had Down syndrome asked me about what the world might be like far into the future: “Will she learn to read?” “Will he ever join the football team?” “Will she get a job?” “Will he get married?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months after I spoke to my aunt, I cared for a child with Down syndrome who required extra medical care after birth. I sat beside the baby’s crib, talking to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space behind my sternum opened. I felt close to my grandmother, despite her death, and to Becky, who I never saw. My whole life, I never once heard my grandmother comment about the implications of disability. To label Becky as someone with disabilities felt like labeling the morning sky as a single color — an overly simplistic categorization of a nuanced person whose moods and gifts and antics shifted as quickly as the sun rises. She modeled acceptance through her actions — by treating Becky as, simply, herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mother’s eyes met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met someone with this,” she confided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would you like to?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told her about Becky, about all she’d accomplished, about how much she was loved. I pulled out my phone and showed her a photo of my cousin in aviator sunglasses and a leather jacket. Beaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother clutched my phone, smiling, as her son opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I worked on this essay, I sent a draft to my aunt so she and Becky could weigh in. When my aunt first read it to Becky, Becky smiled the whole time. They were then gracious enough to FaceTime with me so I could ask Becky’s thoughts myself. As my aunt and I reminisced, Becky waved and smiled. Her expressive language is waning (perhaps related to early Alzheimer’s that afflicts some middle-age adults with Down syndrome), but she knew me and was excited to see me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My aunt’s stories about times when people underestimated Becky’s ability to understand everyone around her reminded me that my cousin has always been a prankster. I asked Becky if she remembers the above stories. Hide-and-seek? High school hallways? So much swimming? Yes, she said to each memory I offered. Did she remember Ede? She offered a wide grin. I asked her if I could publish this piece about her. With a serious expression, she again said yes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any one of us can only be who we are. Who we are, and who we become, is shaped by the people who raised us and the people we know, but also by the people we meet and the people we read about. In the 20 years since I graduated from medical school, the patients I’ve cared for, the families I’ve served, and the mentors who trained me all shaped how I understand this world. They’ve opened my eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I would not have known how to look at this world, to truly see how people move through it, had it not been for how my grandmother treated my cousin. Looking back, their relationship is easily labeled: acceptance, kindness, unconditional love. But, as a child, these things were so ingrained, I never noticed them. My grandmother gifted me an irrefutable understanding that when I am able to love and accept people for exactly who they are, I am the doctor and person I aspire to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note: Names and details of some individuals mentioned in this essay have been changed to protect their privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Fleishman, M.D., is a neonatologist and writer based in Philadelphia.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a possible link between the placenta — the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus — and the origins of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed true, this finding could enhance scientists' understanding of how certain psychiatric disorders start to take root before birth, or are made more likely by events in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/abs/neurodevelopmental-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia-following-a-trail-of-evidence-from-cradle-to-grave/DB470DDDB2A225948678AD048629F99B" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/abs/neurodevelopmental-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia-following-a-trail-of-evidence-from-cradle-to-grave/DB470DDDB2A225948678AD048629F99B" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neurodevelopmental hypothesis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," first proposed in 1987 by neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/93" target="_blank" data-url="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/93" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daniel Weinberger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, schizophrenia originates during fetal brain development. The theory suggests that a combination of genetic risk factors and prenatal conditions shape early brain wiring, thus increasing the likelihood of schizophrenia and other mental health disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While widely accepted as feasible, the exact mechanism behind this hypothesis is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a recent study published March 14 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8526823188123239845&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-57760-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Forigins-of-schizophrenia-linked-to-epigenetics-of-the-placenta" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57760-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-57760-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Forigins-of-schizophrenia-linked-to-epigenetics-of-the-placenta" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that part of the answer may lie in epigenetic modifications in the placenta. These are chemical changes to DNA molecules that don't alter the genes within them, but rather affect which genes are switched on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ivf-may-raise-risk-of-certain-disorders-in-babies-and-epigenetic-signatures-in-the-placenta-could-explain-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ivf-may-raise-risk-of-certain-disorders-in-babies-and-epigenetic-signatures-in-the-placenta-could-explain-why"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IVF may raise risk of certain disorders in babies — and epigenetic 'signatures' in the placenta could explain why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists analyzed DNA from 368 placenta samples, focusing on a type of epigenetic change called DNA methylation, which affects gene expression. They identified more than 214,000 stretches of DNA in the placenta where DNA methylation often takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these methylated DNA sites were located in areas where DNA is actively used to produce RNA and proteins; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a genetic cousin of DNA that helps shuttle blueprints out to protein construction sites in the cell. It's feasible, then, that DNA methylation can silence or activate genes involved in placental development and function, the team said. Changes in placental function are important because the placenta acts as an intermediate between the maternal environment and the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already linked specific genes to psychiatric disorders, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/ai-pinpoints-where-psychosis-originates-in-the-brain" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/ai-pinpoints-where-psychosis-originates-in-the-brain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/massive-study-of-3-million-people-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-bipolar-disorder" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/massive-study-of-3-million-people-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-bipolar-disorder"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34718-depression-treatment-psychotherapy-anti-depressants.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34718-depression-treatment-psychotherapy-anti-depressants.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So the team compared their placenta DNA methylation data with existing data on these disorders, to see if the same genes cropped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that several psychiatric disorder-related genes are highly methylated in the placenta. Therefore, they hypothesized that methylation can affect the activity of these placental genes — changing whether or not they make proteins — which in turn would affect fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these potential effects on the developing fetal brain, the researchers looked at how DNA methylation alters gene expression in the placenta. They found that many of the genes affected by DNA methylation are involved in immune responses. Based on these findings, they hypothesized that DNA methylation in the placenta influences the expression of immune-related genes, potentially raising the risk of infection in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949924024000132" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949924024000132" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have linked infections during pregnancy — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seasonal influenza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Zika — to altered neurodevelopment of the fetus and a higher risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. Researchers believe that infections during pregnancy can interfere with fetal brain development by triggering maternal immune responses that then cause fetal brain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; or, alternatively, germs may directly infect fetal brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research hints at a possible throughline between the epigenetics of the placenta and these harmful immune responses. However, "the one problem is that this paper does not provide direct experimental evidence that specific methylation patterns lead to schizophrenia or other neuropsychiatric disorders," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://las.touro.edu/faculty/faculty-members/loike-john.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://las.touro.edu/faculty/faculty-members/loike-john.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;John Loike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and bioethics at Touro University in New York, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of pinpointing those exact mechanisms, this study looks at changes in the placenta's DNA as a kind of marker to explore how conditions during pregnancy might be linked to brain disorders later in life, said Loike, who was not involved in the study. "Further research is necessary to substantiate these findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this epigenetic link is confirmed, the finding could theoretically point to ways of preventing psychiatric disorders, the authors suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could identify risk factors at the prenatal stage, we could intervene before symptoms appear, adjusting treatments or designing personalized preventive strategies," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariadna-Cilleros-Portet" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariadna-Cilleros-Portet" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ariadna Cilleros-Portet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/upv-ehu-part-of-genetic-risk-for-schizophrenia-acts-through-the-placenta" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/upv-ehu-part-of-genetic-risk-for-schizophrenia-acts-through-the-placenta" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ-lImhrwCt5ME4QB4txTyPAQSrn6TH4Y0R" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ-lImhrwCt5ME4QB4txTyPAQSrn6TH4Y0R slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear, so any exposed person who isn’t vaccinated should avoid public gatherings for three weeks, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks,” state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Denver case isn’t related to a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;case in Pueblo in an unvaccinated adult who also visited Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. That person visited Southwest Deli and Cafe in south Pueblo from March 17 to 21, as well as the Southern Colorado Clinic in Pueblo West and the South Side Walmart in Pueblo on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The distinctive measles rash doesn’t appear until the person has already been contagious for about four days. People who could have been exposed and have symptoms should call their health care provider before coming in, so the provider can take precautions to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are 97% effective in preventing measles. People who survived it also generally have lifelong protection. Doctors don’t recommend trying to get measles, though, because of the risk of pneumonia, neurological damage and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/06/rfk-jr-visits-epicenter-of-texas-measles-outbreak-after-death-of-second-child-who-was-infected/"&gt;Two children&lt;/a&gt; and one adult have died this year in outbreaks in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A may be useful in treating children who have measles, but it doesn’t prevent infection. Parents shouldn’t give vitamin A without a doctor’s supervision, because giving too much can cause liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children can receive their first measles shot at about 1 year old and their second between 4 and 6. Babies who are going to travel abroad can receive an early shot from six months on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, the United States already had &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114980?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-04-04&amp;amp;mh=cb749f9dbd5470c1317620ae93c2ec2a&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4vg-k6dL2McqgKzW6iYcQLIhRsw8Z3U-v1TLMF6Gkk4jRIm37DsX8JgcEOO0hI5qoDg_sFzLHDYDJO-HDsppFII3R-n6aDnB7J9sqpot7tHDHtU%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-04-04&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition"&gt;twice as many measles cases as it did in all of 2024&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Research in mice showed limited intakes of one particular essential amino acid can slow the impacts of aging and even lengthen their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists now wonder if these findings could help people improve their longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids we use to build proteins in our bodies. It is essential for our survival, but since our cells can't produce it from scratch, we have to get it from sources like eggs, dairy, soy protein, and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNHCTR9u4y4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can always be too much of a good thing. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00166-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413121001662%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; using data from a 2016-2017 survey of Wisconsin residents had found dietary isoleucine levels were linked with metabolic health and that people with higher BMIs were generally consuming much greater quantities of the amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of," metabolism researcher Dudley Lamming from the University of Wisconsin, US, who was involved in both studies, &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 when the newest findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference in lifespan and what we call 'healthspan,' even when it started closer to mid-life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent study, a genetically diverse group of mice was fed either a diet containing 20 common amino acids as a control, a diet where all amino acids were reduced by about two-thirds, or a diet where only isoleucine was reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were around six months old at the start of the study, which is the equivalent age of a 30-year-old person. They could eat as much as they wanted, but only from the specific kind of food provided to their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg" alt="Various soy foods" class="size-full wp-image-146146" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our cells can't produce isoleucine from scratch – we have to get it from foods such as soy protein. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFMZwKkZ1w/"&gt;ArtStudio Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting dietary isoleucine increased the lifespan and healthspan of the mice, reduced their frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control. Male mice had their lifespans increased 33 percent compared to those whose isoleucine was not restricted, and females had a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mice also scored better in 26 measures of health, including muscle strength, endurance, blood sugar levels, tail use, and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male mice in this group had less age-related prostate enlargement, and were less likely to develop the cancerous tumors that are common in the diverse mice strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the mice given low isoleucine food also ate significantly more calories than the others. But rather than gaining weight, they actually burned more energy and maintained leaner body weights, even though their activity levels were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_112585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract shows dietary isoleucine was restricted by 67%, charts showing blood glucose and body weight declining over time / age respectively, reduced frailty and cancer, increased lifespan (survival improved by 33 percent)" class="wp-image-112585 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg 996w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the impact the reduced isoleucine diet had on mice in the study. (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;Green et al., C&lt;em&gt;ell Metabolism, &lt;/em&gt;2023)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think restricting isoleucine in humans, either by diet or pharmaceutical means, has the potential to yield similar anti-aging effects - although, as with all mice studies, we won't know for sure until it's actually tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Although the food provided to the mice was controlled, the researchers noted that diet is an incredibly complex chemical reaction, and there may be other dietary components involved in producing these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restricting protein intake in general, for instance, has detrimental effects on the body, mouse or human. Translating this research for real-world human use is more complicated than just reducing intake of high-protein foods, even though this is the simplest way to limit isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amino acid restriction level was constant in all experiments, and they acknowledge that more fine-tuning may be required for optimum effects across different mice strains and sexes – when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can't just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet," Lamming &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But narrowing these benefits down to a single amino acid gets us closer to understanding the biological processes and maybe potential interventions for humans, like an isoleucine-blocking drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their findings suggest that routine immunization could play an unexpected role in protecting brain health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Risk Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Shingles vaccination was linked to a 20% lower risk of dementia over seven years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Experiment Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Eligibility for the vaccine was based on exact birthdate, allowing a unique causal analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Prevention Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point to potential public health strategies for reducing dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination to prevent shingles also reduces the risk of developing dementia in later life, according to a research paper published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is based on the analysis of data collected in connection with the introduction of a shingles immunization program launched in Wales in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108467"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a doctor with a syringe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists with their special expertise in statistical analyses have made a significant contribution to the corresponding study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to apply our capabilities in statistics to medical data, thus forging a bridge between these two fields,” said Dr. Markus Eyting of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with co-lead author Dr. Min Xie, a postdoctoral researcher at the Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, he demonstrated that the shingles vaccination was associated with a 20 percent reduction in the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a period of seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the article, “A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia,” this could raise various new possibilities for dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic health records for Wales supply basis for statistical analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Min Xie identified the groundwork of what would represent a “natural experiment” created by the introduction of a herpes zoster vaccination program in Wales about two years ago. In the program, the eligibility to receive the vaccine was determined by an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were automatically ineligible for life, while those born on or after 2 September 1933 were entitled to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can speak of a natural experiment in this context because this setting gives us the opportunity to compare individuals who had just turned 80 with those who had not quite reached 80 years of age,” Eyting explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then looked at the risk of developing dementia over the next seven years,” Eyting continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of the analysis was to identify a potential causal effect rather than just a correlation. In other words, the researchers were looking for a causal relationship between the shingles vaccine and the risk of developing dementia, not just a random connection between the two factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In economics, threshold values and target dates – in this case, the individuals’ birthdays – are often employed to test for causal effects using regression discontinuity designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This method is widely used in economics but has not yet been adequately recognized as a tool for clinical research,” Eyting added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his view, regression discontinuity analyses offer many opportunities for evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markus Eyting is a postdoctoral researcher at the Gutenberg School of Management and Economics (GSME) of Mainz University and at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research focuses on experimental methods and survey and administrative data to study the interplay of beliefs and individual decision making with applications relating to health, discrimination, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also involved in the study were Dr. Simon Heß of the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who supported the data analysis with his expertise in econometric methodologies, as well as researchers from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyting received the 2023 Young Economist Award from the European Economic Association (EEA) for a paper on the cause of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this vaccines and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f49f95809c869d9ada829b9d9380b4819a9dd999959d9a8eda9091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kathrin Voigt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-mainz.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kathrin Voigt – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/a&gt;” by Markus Eyting et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="inline-recommendations"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 13:14:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBWZTVuTElSMkZhMktOWncwLU1ERnFDT3hkWXZKYlY1QnQyMlR3Wm5wRjF0N2FDczlXLWNKckJhUmwyR0ZaOW01ZTRtUmlRUktWbUhLYm0xU3VqNHpMbFluN1lUMlFCbWxCV2Uwb2V3</guid></item><item><title>I’m a brain health expert.

&lt;p&gt;Most times you read about a ‘cure’ in the news, you’ll find out towards the end of the story that it’s just a ‘potential’ cure, or that someone has been ‘seemingly cured.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from Palm Beach, Florida comes the story that 72-year-old Orlando Avendaño has been cured of his essential hand tremor, and we can also say the cure, which took just a few hours, was fully covered by Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avendaño has lived with the hand tremor for more than 30 years, and basic fine motor movements like writing his name or eating with a fork are beyond him. Picking up a cup of water has to be done with both hands, and he prefers to eat with a big spoon at dinnertime because he can better disguise his tremor that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delray Medical Center however can remove an essential hand tremor using targeted ultrasound, a procedure already approved and available around the US. It uses the same high-frequency sound waves that bats use for echolocation, and that an OBGYN uses to image a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Delray, the ultrasound is turned into a weapon through a piece of headgear called Neuravive that can deliver precise applications of ultrasonic waves into any part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed &lt;a href="https://insightec.com/lp/essential-tremor-int-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by Insightec&lt;/a&gt;, the headgear is guided in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging, and, as well as being covered by Medicare, is also covered in 22 different Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avendaño arrived at Delray in the early morning for his procedure. He equipped the headgear and was placed in an MRI machine where neurosurgeon Dr. Lloyd Zucker was able to detect the exact spot in the brain where the tremor originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutting-edge technology then created a small lesion in the brain which “knocked out” the tremor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the need for surgery or anesthesia, and after just a few hours, Avendaño emerged and held up his hand: stiff as a board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my God, it’s unbelievable,” he said after coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured on camera by NBC 6, it was difficult to tell who was happier, Avendaño or Dr. Zucker, who called the procedure his “magic track.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably the most wonderful thing. I’ve been doing it for years, and as you can see as I start to smile, you can’t take this away, when you see the patients and the families and what it does for them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Avoid screens before bed” is one of the most common pieces of sleep advice. But what if the real problem isn’t screen time − it’s the way we use social media at night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation is one of the most widespread yet overlooked &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/u-s-surgeon-general-discusses-the-importance-of-healthy-sleep/"&gt;public health issues&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite needing eight to 10 hours of sleep, &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/happens-teenagers-dont-get-enough-sleep/"&gt;most adolescents&lt;/a&gt; fall short, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.52965/001c.74555"&gt;nearly two-thirds of young adults&lt;/a&gt; regularly get less than the recommended &lt;a href="https://www.thensf.org/how-many-hours-of-sleep-do-you-really-need/"&gt;seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep isn’t just about feeling tired − it’s linked to worsened &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/screen-time-is-contributing-to-chronic-sleep-deprivation-in-tweens-and-teens-a-pediatric-sleep-expert-explains-how-critical-sleep-is-to-kids-mental-health-204436"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.12.006"&gt;emotion regulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/memory-and-sleep"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2209123120"&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; and even increased risk for &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation"&gt;chronic illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/33.5.585"&gt;early mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/"&gt;social media is nearly universal&lt;/a&gt; among young adults, with 84% using at least one platform daily. While research has long focused on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/school-start-times-and-screen-time-late-in-the-evening-exacerbate-sleep-deprivation-in-us-teenagers-179178"&gt;screen time&lt;/a&gt; as the culprit for poor sleep, growing evidence suggests that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.01.001"&gt;how often&lt;/a&gt; people check social media − and how &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2016.05.008"&gt;emotionally engaged&lt;/a&gt; they are − matters even more than how long they spend online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eXIhdAUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;social psychologist and sleep researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I study how social behaviors, including social media habits, affect sleep and well-being. Sleep isn’t just an individual behavior; it’s shaped by our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.10.012"&gt;social environments and relationships&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the most common yet underestimated factors shaping modern sleep? How we engage with social media before bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Emotional investment in social media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply measuring time spent on social media, researchers have started looking at how &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0030277"&gt;emotionally connected&lt;/a&gt; people feel to their social media use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that the way people emotionally engage with social media may have a greater impact on sleep quality than the total time they spend online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 study of 830 young adults, my colleagues and I examined how different types of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/bs14090794"&gt;social media engagement predicted sleep problems&lt;/a&gt;. We found that frequent social media visits and emotional investment were stronger predictors of poor sleep than total screen time. Additionally, presleep cognitive arousal and social comparison played a key role in linking social media engagement to sleep disruption, suggesting that social media’s effects on sleep extend beyond simple screen exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these findings suggest that cutting screen time alone may not be enough − reducing how often people check social media and how emotionally connected they feel to it may be more effective in promoting healthier sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How social media disrupts sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled to fall asleep after scrolling through social media, it’s not just the screen keeping you awake. While blue light can &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;delay melatonin production&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/bs14090794"&gt;my team’s research&lt;/a&gt; and that of others suggests that the way people interact with social media may play an even bigger role in &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-and-social-media"&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the biggest ways social media interferes with your sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presleep arousal:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers"&gt;Doomscrolling&lt;/a&gt; and emotionally charged content on social media keeps your brain in a state of heightened alertness, making it harder to relax and fall asleep. Whether it’s political debates, distressing news or even exciting personal updates, emotionally stimulating content can trigger increased &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20501579211056116"&gt;cognitive and physiological arousal&lt;/a&gt; that delays sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social comparison:&lt;/strong&gt; Viewing idealized social media posts before bed can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2023.2180647"&gt;upward social comparison&lt;/a&gt;, increasing stress and making it harder to sleep. People tend to compare themselves to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2022.00023"&gt;highly curated versions of others’ lives&lt;/a&gt; − vacations, fitness progress, career milestones − which can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2016.1267647"&gt;feelings of inadequacy and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; that disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habitual checking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/how-does-social-media-affect-sleep"&gt;Social media use after lights out&lt;/a&gt; is a strong predictor of poor sleep, as checking notifications and scrolling before bed can quickly become an automatic habit. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.07.009"&gt;nighttime-specific social media use&lt;/a&gt;, especially after lights are out, is linked to shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes and lower sleep quality. This pattern reflects &lt;a href="https://time.com/6957353/bedtime-procrastination-how-to-go-to-sleep/"&gt;bedtime procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, where people delay sleep despite knowing it would be better for their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of missing out, or FOMO:&lt;/strong&gt; The urge to stay connected also keeps many people scrolling long past their intended bedtime, making sleep feel secondary to staying updated. Research shows that higher &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-fomo-for-something-thats-not-even-fun-its-not-the-event-youre-missing-its-the-bonding-247047"&gt;FOMO levels&lt;/a&gt; are linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106487"&gt;more frequent nighttime social media use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16061-4"&gt;poorer sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. The anticipation of new messages, posts or updates can create a sense of social pressure to stay online and reinforce the habit of delaying sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors make social media more than just a passive distraction − it becomes an active barrier to restful sleep. In other words, that late-night scroll isn’t harmless − it’s quietly rewiring your sleep and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to use social media without sleep disruption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to quit social media, but restructuring how you engage with it at night could help. Research suggests that small &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-best-diet-for-healthy-sleep-a-nutritional-epidemiologist-explains-what-food-choices-will-help-you-get-more-restful-zs-219955"&gt;behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; to your &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/bedtime-routine-for-adults"&gt;bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; can make a significant difference in sleep quality. I suggest trying these practical, evidence-backed strategies for improving your sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give your brain time to wind down:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid emotionally charged content 30 to 60 minutes before bed to help your mind relax and prepare for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create separation between social media and sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Set your phone to “Do Not Disturb” or leave it outside the bedroom to avoid the temptation of late-night checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce mindless scrolling:&lt;/strong&gt; If you catch yourself endlessly refreshing, take a &lt;a href="https://www.activeminds.org/blog/mindful-consumption-of-social-media-can-support-our-mental-health/"&gt;small, mindful pause&lt;/a&gt; and ask yourself: “Do I actually want to be on this app right now?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief moment of awareness can help break the habit loop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Using a wearable quantum brain scanner, researchers measured gamma waves in over 100 individuals aged 2 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scanner, designed with optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), allows for noninvasive brain imaging even in very young children. This method opens new doors for understanding and diagnosing neurodevelopmental conditions like autism much earlier than previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excitation-Inhibition Balance:&lt;/strong&gt; Excitatory processes decline and inhibitory processes rise with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearable MEG Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; A child-friendly scanner captures real-time brain activity in even toddlers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishes a developmental benchmark to better understand disorders like autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has shown how aspects of brain function change with age, revealing that excitatory processes in the brain decrease, while inhibitory processes increase as children get older. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are an important step in understanding disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108459"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby in a futuristic brain scan helmet." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research teams in both institutions are working together to expand the range and extent of neurodevelopmental data, in both healthy and atypical brain populations.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain function is based on a delicate balance of excitatory processes (which make brain cells fire) and inhibitory processes (which stop brain cells firing) – this is known as the E-I balance. Usually, to measure this, sensors would need to be placed in the brain (which requires experimental surgery and so cannot be routinely done in humans).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, published today in &lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, scientists have shown that it can be measured using a novel wearable brain scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nottingham and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto scanned the brains of 101 healthy children and adults between the ages of 2 and 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a wearable design of magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner, the team were able to measure high frequency brain waves (known as gamma waves) that are generated in brain circuits that rely on both excitatory and inhibitory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that gamma waves change significantly with age, with low amplitude broadband waves in children and high amplitude narrowband waves in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using biophysical models of the measured gamma waves, the research team were then able to translate their findings into measurements of E-I balance, showing that as children get older excitatory processes decrease, while inhibitory processes increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trajectory is critical for healthy brain development and is understood to be atypical in older children and adults with psychiatric disorders. This provides a benchmark (in typically developing young children) against which disorders like autism can be understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric disorders are due to atypical brain function, which can be measured with a range of brain imaging technologies, such as MRI, EEG and MEG. Childhood disorders, however, can emerge in the early years of life (2-4 years of age), but there are limited ways to investigate the brain function in children who are this young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wearable brain scanner is based on quantum technology, and uses LEGO-brick-sized sensors – called optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) – which are incorporated into a lightweight helmet to measure the magnetic fields generated by brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique design means the system can be adapted to fit any age group, including very young children. The system takes only seconds to set up, and children wear it and can move freely during a scan. It is therefore ideally suited to scanning children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Brookes from the University of Nottingham’s Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre has led the development of the new technology which is now being installed across the world by Nottingham-based spin-out company Cerca Magnetics, he said: “Quantum technologies have revolutionised what is possible with brain imaging. 10 years ago measuring MEG signals in very young children as they move around freely, whilst wearing what is essentially a hat, seemed like science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, it’s possible and it’s opening up new worlds of possibility – particularly related to the developing brain in the early years of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World renowned neuroscientist Dr Margot Taylor – who leads autism research at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto – said: “OPM technology allows us to complete studies in young children that were simply not possible otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are able to obtain fantastic data in one-year-olds; our next frontier is having the same success in infants from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect that these studies will give us better understanding of the early onset of neurodevelopmental disorders, which will help in the care of the children in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was led by Dr Natalie Rhodes who, following undergraduate and postgraduate study at the University of Nottingham, moved to Toronto to continue her scientific career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “Just like a well-tuned orchestra, our brains rely on a delicate balance of signals. We now have a way to measure how this balance changes from early life to adulthood and can use this to better understand developmental differences in conditions like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that an imbalance in brain signals is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions, but until now, we haven’t had a suitable method to measure it in young children. Using OPM technology, we can now study brain function with unprecedented precision from very young children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Nottingham launched Cerca Magnetics in 2020 to commercialise OPM-MEG scanners and related technologies. The wearable system has been installed in a number of high profile research institutions across the globe, including at SickKids in Toronto where around half of the volunteers in the current study were scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research teams in both institutions are working together to expand the range and extent of neurodevelopmental data, in both healthy and atypical brain populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by a healthcare impact partnership grant, awarded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK. The authors have also wish to acknowledge the UK quantum technologies programme and in particular the Quantum Hub for Sensors Imaging and Timing (QuSIT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work at SickKids was supported by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI; 2021) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#36535b5b5718425e5944585376585942425f58515e575b18575518435d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emma Thorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Thorne – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00527/128456/Measuring-the-neurodevelopmental-trajectory-of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of excitatory-inhibitory balance via visual gamma oscillations&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalie Rhodes et al. &lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of excitatory-inhibitory balance via visual gamma oscillations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (E-I balance) is thought to underlie many neurodevelopmental disorders; however, its study is typically restricted to adults, animal models, and the lab-bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological oscillations in the gamma frequency band relate closely to E-I balance, and a new technology—OPM-MEG—offers the possibility to measure such signals across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used OPM-MEG to measure gamma oscillations induced by visual stimulation in 101 participants, aged 2–34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a significantly changing spectrum with age, with low-amplitude broadband gamma oscillations in children and high-amplitude band limited oscillations in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a canonical cortical microcircuit to model these signals, revealing a significant decrease in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory signalling with age in the superficial pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings detail the first MEG metrics of gamma oscillations and their underlying generators from toddlerhood, providing a benchmark against which future studies can contextualise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:32:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5aVkZqV3M5aFpIRUZGVkt2RW4xOXh2Y3lzSGg2OGNESHR5UE14WTV1YmkzN19NUVFQa1hNdy1TeXNJS2NIZUgyendLQWhoNFZvTC10bFoxVjdkMFZRUzRiMzM0RTdDaE1nX3BlSVJqdXZINFlW</guid></item><item><title>I Was Caring For A Patient With Down Syndrome.

You were &lt;em&gt;so kind &lt;/em&gt;to that little boy!” a pediatric resident told me with a saccharine and insincere tone. I was a third-year medical student, and she’d pulled me aside after she’d witnessed me giggling and zipping trucks along bedrails with a patient. I was also a 25-year-old woman who lacked a professional filter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why wouldn’t I be kind?” I blurted out. My voice mirrored my grandmother’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember if the child was experiencing a specific ailment commonly coupled with his Down syndrome, such as leukemia or a structural heart or digestive condition, or if he was hospitalized for a typical pediatric problem like asthma, appendicitis or some accidental injury. What I remember is the resident’s eyebrows arching and her lips pursing. I realized too late she’d expected me to just say “thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trained my eyes on the tiny plastic frog dangling from her stethoscope. The amphibious toy meant to distract children while she auscultated their hearts and lungs couldn’t distract me from the sound of my pounding heart. We stood silently facing each other in the hospital corridor, until I heard the little boy’s Tonka truck clank to the floor. Saved by gravity, I pivoted back into his room to pick it up with echoes of my grandmother’s yelling buzzing in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years earlier, my grandmother Yetta reprimanded me and my cousin for tumbling headfirst down the half-flight of carpeted stairs in her split-level house, wearing the smocked Polly Flinders dresses she’d bought us. It would take me another 20 years to understand that my grandmother’s reprimands captured her purest expression of acceptance toward my cousin Becky, who has Down syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother’s words bit the air: “Rachel, Rebecca, stop it!” She was a staunch woman with curly jet-black hair who audited taxes for the IRS while raising three boys and running a luncheonette with my grandfather. She had zero tolerance for nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of her grandchildren called her Granny, but not Becky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not Ede. Granny,” my grandmother would chide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, my cousin smiled. “No. Ede.” Becky never explained why she used this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And always, my grandmother smiled back. Their lighthearted refrain was a familiar script interjected between my grandmother’s complaints about the way my grandfather chewed everything he ate and how long it took him to do his daily crossword puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author in Lake George, New York, in 1980.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Charles Fleishman"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Charles Fleishman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was a year older than me. We spent our elementary school days playing hide-and-seek with our brothers, middle school swimming in her parents’ backyard pool, and high school changing into team swimsuits in our school locker room. My grandparents eventually moved to Florida while Becky and I were still waving hello to each other across our school cafeteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Becky and I finished high school in the late ’90s, she moved to California with her mom and stepfather, and I moved to New York City for college and medical school. While I spent the bulk of my time in libraries, Becky completed vocational training and then worked at a bowling alley, and our grandmother discovered email. She sent Becky countless messages from her handle, GranEde, and Becky always replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t meant to be rude by rejecting the resident’s compliment, but my actions didn’t feel praiseworthy or even unusual. The world I knew before medical school was the one modeled by the adults who’d raised me. I’d always known that people with Down syndrome have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="distinct physical features " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;distinct physical features &lt;/a&gt;— what the medical literature calls “stigmata” — and a propensity for certain health conditions and disabilities, but I had never witnessed how they can be &lt;a href="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="subjected to" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;subjected to&lt;/a&gt; harassment, humiliation, mistreatment and neglect, both in hospitals and outside them. I’d come to learn that “stigma,” a concept put &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="forth by Erving Goffman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;forth by Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt;, encompassed “disgrace attached to a particular condition or trait.” I’d never perceived Becky as stigmatized because our family did not isolate her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades after high school, Becky and I were mostly out of touch. I asked family members about her. I liked her &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; posts. But my strongest connection to Becky was through my grandmother. When I flew to Florida for visits, my grandmother, in between digging through the sale rack at Bloomingdale’s and instructing the deli workers at Publix about the proper thickness of turkey breast slices, gave me the scoop on Becky. She told me about the races Becky swam in the Special Olympics and the volunteer work she did. And she told me, over and over, about the day she took Becky out for Chinese food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was in her late 20s at the time. My grandmother knew my cousin’s attitude about reading was inconsistent, but she refused to capitulate to Becky’s refusals. My grandmother handed her a menu. She waited. My cousin perused it and then announced to the waitress that she wanted “the happy family.” My grandmother, who once sat my father at the dinner table for hours because he refused to eat his peas, scoured the menu and discovered “the happy family” was a combination of several dishes, meant to serve six. She resigned herself to taking home leftovers because Becky had, after all, read the menu. Every time I heard this story, I believed my cousin picked “the happy family” not only because she wanted to eat what was in it, but because the words captured how she felt sitting in a sticky leather booth across from a woman who cherished her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author at Becky’s bat mitzvah.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was early in my residency the first time I cared for a baby diagnosed with Down syndrome after birth. Becky was not on my mind as I sat, silent, beside my neonatologist mentor while she told a husband and wife that their 1-hour-old child might have this genetic condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenatal testing, which from the narrow perspective of a pediatrician affords parents the benefit of emotional, intellectual and medical preparation before their babies are born, had not flagged the possibility. Two teaspoons of blood drawn after the 10th week of pregnancy, known as “noninvasive prenatal testing,” identifies more than 99% of fetuses with Down syndrome. But this test wasn’t available back then, when a combination of first and second trimester blood tests and ultrasounds (still sometimes done today) &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="identified many but not all" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;identified many but not all&lt;/a&gt; fetuses with Down syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was not on my mind as my mentor asked the baby’s name. I was transfixed by the way she spoke with purpose, and without judgment or pity — without implying Down syndrome was bad or tragic. She pointed out the physical features typical for Down syndrome and then asked the parents what they saw as we all peered at the baby’s face, hands and toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families receive medical information differently. Some families readily believe the impressions of a physician, some want confirmatory genetic testing before accepting this diagnosis, while still others need time to process before engaging in further dialogue with doctors. My mentor’s goal was to inform the family of the possibility that the child had Down syndrome, not to convince them she was right. The only urgency she had was to build trust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation had been so honest, so compassionate, so pure, that I left the room enchanted with the spell of human connection. I’d never considered that, as a doctor, I could learn to cast sacred spells with words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so I became a neonatologist — in part because of that mentor and the glittering moment of truth she’d conveyed with raw kindness, and in part so I could chase the same sparkling connections with families navigating the delight of babies’ births while accepting their concomitant medical diagnoses. Most of my patients are either born prematurely or born on time but unexpectedly sick. Almost every day, I reassure families that neonatal intensive care is likely to allow their children to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1866, Dr. John Langdon Down published a medical paper whose now-offensive title, “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots&lt;/a&gt;,” obscures the importance of describing, and thereby lending medical legitimacy and attention to, human beings with Down syndrome. In 1959, not quite 20 years before Becky’s birth, the discovery that Down syndrome was caused by an extra 21st chromosome established the first link between an intellectual disability and genetics and paved the way for prenatal diagnostics. Since the 1970s, Down syndrome is &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="increasingly prevalent" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;increasingly prevalent&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, while rates have simultaneously declined in &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Europe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Down syndrome and counseling families remains a tiny part of my job. I’ve rolled stools beside new mothers during repeat C-sections to share what seemed possible. I’ve sat beside families that other doctors didn’t quite know how to approach and disclosed the truth myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time I have these high-stakes conversations, I roll my shoulders back, feel my sternum rise with my inhalations as I beckon reverence into these hospital rooms. I watch parental eyebrows and pupils and fingers clenching or unclenching as I utter measured words and allow conversations to bloom with unbridled parental emotion and exploratory questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I refrained from sharing stories about my cousin because Becky is only one person with a common condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million people" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;6 million people&lt;/a&gt; differently. I didn’t want to inject her life story into these families’ stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Bernard Fleishman (Becky's grandpa, left), Becky Fleishman, and Yetta Fleishman (Becky's grandma) at Becky’s bat mitzvah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was several years into my career as a neonatologist when my grandmother died and I lost my connection to Becky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky wasn’t at the funeral. No one quite knew how to tell her what had happened, and taking Becky across the country while everyone was grieving wasn’t feasible. My extended family shared stories of my grandmother. When it was my turn at the podium in that South Florida funeral home, I rambled, crying because I loved her for her freely expressed opinions. I mumbled about seagulls and almost sat down to sob into my husband’s blazer, when, from the depth of my grief, I shared an unscripted sentiment that sounds obvious only in hindsight: “How Granny treated Becky had a profound impact on me as a pediatrician.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew home to Philadelphia at peace with my grief-stricken insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought to call Becky or ask how she’d taken the news about Ede. I mailed holiday cards from Philadelphia to San Diego every December. Some years, she mailed back photos of herself making scratch pizzas and pastries. When I saw Facebook photos of her 40th birthday at Disneyland, I was ecstatic. Mostly, though, Becky and I remained out of touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, three years after my grandmother died, I reconnected with Becky’s mom. Because of divorce and distance, I hadn’t spoken to my Aunt Sylvia since I was a teenager. I was struck, as I listened to her stories about Becky, by how much I missed my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To this day, Becky will tell you she doesn’t have Down syndrome,” my aunt told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s because she was raised to believe she can do anything she wants,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a surprise,” my aunt explained. “The doctors told me lots of stuff that was just wrong.” They didn’t think Becky would breastfeed. They said she wouldn’t lift her head for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was appalled. I’ve cared for babies with Down syndrome with these challenges. But I’ve also cared for babies who did not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Becky was born, one of the doctors told us she belonged in an institution.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what?!” I hadn’t known that.

If Becky didn’t come home, he suggested adoption as an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But your grandmother wouldn’t hear of it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my eyes wrinkle and a flash of warmth. “What did she do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She marched into my hospital room,” my aunt recounted. “She said, ‘You’d bring a puppy home to be taken care of — she’s your daughter. You are bringing her home!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my grandmother. A firebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt gave me a gift that day. I hadn’t known I’d spent my career manifesting words uttered a year before I was born. I flashed back to countless babies’ bedsides, to families who held their children, desperate for them to get better, survive, go home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it took, whatever their children needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What those families craved, all of them, was hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author (lower right) FaceTiming with Becky Fleishman (left) and her aunt Sylvia Ginsberg.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to think more about Becky when parents whose children had Down syndrome asked me about what the world might be like far into the future: “Will she learn to read?” “Will he ever join the football team?” “Will she get a job?” “Will he get married?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months after I spoke to my aunt, I cared for a child with Down syndrome who required extra medical care after birth. I sat beside the baby’s crib, talking to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space behind my sternum opened. I felt close to my grandmother, despite her death, and to Becky, who I never saw. My whole life, I never once heard my grandmother comment about the implications of disability. To label Becky as someone with disabilities felt like labeling the morning sky as a single color — an overly simplistic categorization of a nuanced person whose moods and gifts and antics shifted as quickly as the sun rises. She modeled acceptance through her actions — by treating Becky as, simply, herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mother’s eyes met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met someone with this,” she confided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would you like to?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told her about Becky, about all she’d accomplished, about how much she was loved. I pulled out my phone and showed her a photo of my cousin in aviator sunglasses and a leather jacket. Beaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother clutched my phone, smiling, as her son opened his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I worked on this essay, I sent a draft to my aunt so she and Becky could weigh in. When my aunt first read it to Becky, Becky smiled the whole time. They were then gracious enough to FaceTime with me so I could ask Becky’s thoughts myself. As my aunt and I reminisced, Becky waved and smiled. Her expressive language is waning (perhaps related to early Alzheimer’s that afflicts some middle-age adults with Down syndrome), but she knew me and was excited to see me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My aunt’s stories about times when people underestimated Becky’s ability to understand everyone around her reminded me that my cousin has always been a prankster. I asked Becky if she remembers the above stories. Hide-and-seek? High school hallways? So much swimming? Yes, she said to each memory I offered. Did she remember Ede? She offered a wide grin. I asked her if I could publish this piece about her. With a serious expression, she again said yes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any one of us can only be who we are. Who we are, and who we become, is shaped by the people who raised us and the people we know, but also by the people we meet and the people we read about. In the 20 years since I graduated from medical school, the patients I’ve cared for, the families I’ve served, and the mentors who trained me all shaped how I understand this world. They’ve opened my eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I would not have known how to look at this world, to truly see how people move through it, had it not been for how my grandmother treated my cousin. Looking back, their relationship is easily labeled: acceptance, kindness, unconditional love. But, as a child, these things were so ingrained, I never noticed them. My grandmother gifted me an irrefutable understanding that when I am able to love and accept people for exactly who they are, I am the doctor and person I aspire to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a glowing couple in their 20s, working and partying hard, getting precious little sleep, says gastroenterologist Shilpa Ravella. Then fast-forward 30 years and the couple may have serious health issues such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/five-surprising-things-that-raise-risk-of-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Late nights, drinking and stress, all these things trigger low-level inflammation which can damage our tissues and then one day it turns into heart disease or cancer,” adds Ravella. “Yes, younger bodies tend to process things more favourably. But the processed food has got worse, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/cancers-that-are-on-the-rise-in-the-under-50s/"&gt;young onset colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; is skyrocketing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being slim isn’t a protection, adds Ravella. “You can be at the gym lifting weights, have big muscles and a flat tummy, but still be highly inflamed. More importantly, you could have a higher risk of disease down the line, without having a clue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden, chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation is a “hot topic” in health and wellness because it’s increasingly recognised as a major driver of heart disease, cancer and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/14/alzheimers-professor-check-research-brain-health/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, as well as autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (where the immune system starts to attack the healthy cells of organs and tissues). And scientists now believe “inflammaging” is one of several essential factors that drive ageing in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, just naturally through a combination of genetics and the sum total of our environmental exposures, our immune systems develop a natural propensity for wanting to engage in chronic inflammation,” explains Dr Nathan Curran, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;functional Medicine Practitioner at London’s Reborne Longevity Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to prevent chronic disease, it needs to go beyond just screening for the disease,” he adds. “We need to be screening for the actual triggers of the disease before they emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is inflammation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation isn’t bad per se. It’s the immune system’s response to any traumatic event in the body tissues – for example, a scraped knee or finger cut. In case of “acute” inflammation, our immune system releases inflammatory cells and cytokines (small proteins that stimulate more inflammatory cells) to neutralise the invading virus or start healing injured tissue. You will experience redness, warmth and swelling, but it will be over in a matter of days. “Acute inflammation serves a very important role in keeping us alive,” &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;ays Dr Curran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our evolutionary history, in order to protect our bodies from pathogens and poisons, we developed a hyperactive immune system, explains Ravella, author of &lt;em&gt;A Silent Fire: The Story of Inflammation, Diet and Disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is inflammation is not always harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic” inflammation happens when this response is switched on all the time, leaving your body in a constant state of alert. The body continues to send white blood cells on the attack in the absence of any threat. This disrupts normal bodily functions and can result in healthy tissues and organs being attacked. Plus your body never gets a chance to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Inflammation and cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole topic of inflammation became a bit more “personal” last October when I learnt I have “a propensity for excessive inflammation on a genetic level” when I did a DNA test at Dr Curran’s clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues were there already: I had high cholesterol and was a point from being pre-diabetic. I sneezed incessantly (and very loudly) after too much fizz or sugar, both of which raise inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have an ‘eager/active’ variant of the gene,” Dr Curran tells me. “This means a relatively mild trigger has the potential to trigger a disproportionately large/sustained release of TNF-alpha (a pro-inflammatory protein), unless we moderate the impact of this genetic variation through an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;s, Vitamin D and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately Google TNF-alpha and find that, worryingly, this cytokine is implicated in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you have the genetic propensity doesn’t mean it will be translated into excessive inflammation,” he adds, “but you need to be mindful of your lifestyle and dietary exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s my family’s history of heart disease to consider, too. “When cholesterol accumulates in the arteries, it creates inflammation because it gets modified and oxidised,” explains British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Cambridge, Ziad Mallat. “And then the body recognises it as a stranger. This inflammation initially serves to clear the oxidised cholesterol from the arteries. But when the body is exposed continuously to this aggression, the clearance capacities become overwhelmed and the inflammation becomes chronic. This causes more build-up of fatty material in the arteries and later may create clots in the arteries, and cause heart attack and stroke. The same thing happens when you have high glucose in diabetes, or if you smoke; it causes injury to the arteries and that creates chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shock motivated me to change my diet (&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gave-up-sugar-month/"&gt;I gave up free sugar,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;brought my cholesterol &lt;/a&gt;down naturally for this paper). Then in March I asked my GP for a CRP (C-reactive protein) blood test (CRP is produced by the liver and if there’s a higher concentration of CRP than usual, it’s a sign of inflammation) and, phew, it’s normal at the moment. The sneezing has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You were really lucky, because your sneezing was so obvious and not everybody has that,” says Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD chair of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic. “Most people have more vague symptoms, like they don’t have the energy they used to, or they’re not sleeping well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cleveland Clinic, Dr Thaddeus’s research programme focuses on determining the root causes of inflammatory diseases with the goal of developing new therapies. “With certain types of inflammatory conditions, they can programme parts of your immune system so they simply malfunction which further fuels inflammation later. A really good example is sepsis. Patients who have had bloodstream infections and spent time in intensive care, if they survive and are able to leave the hospital, what’s well recognised is that parts of their immune system are no longer functional. So they’re at risk for repeat infections with worse overall inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of diet and the gut microbiome in inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function of the immune system is to protect us from invaders—and to be able to tell apart the cells of our own body from other cells that don’t belong to us. And scientists have estimated that about 70 per cent of the immune system lives in the gut microbiome. Chronic inflammation in the gut may be due to inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/ulcerative-colitis-symptoms-treatment-surgery/#:~:text=Ulcerative%20colitis%20is%20an%20inflammatory,which%20bleed%20and%20leak%20pus."&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;. But a modern Western diet high in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/rob-hobson-family-cooking/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; can literally cause our whole body to be on fire, too. The poorer the quality of a meal, the higher the inflammatory response. Our microbiome (and the trillions of bugs in our intestines crucial to human health) is worryingly damaged, in contrast to our ancestors who had better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of inflammation contributes to most of our “21st-century” diseases, says Dr Stappenbeck. “The link between what’s going on in your gut microbiome, and diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or sleep disorders or depression is really amazing. We’re learning, for example, that Parkinson’s disease probably starts in many of these patients in the colon and becomes more evident once brain lesions have developed. A lot of patients with Parkinson’s have very severe constipation because the neurons in their colon are damaged and don’t function properly. They could have been experiencing that for years without realising. So could we diagnose Parkinson’s earlier before the cells of the brain are damaged?”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, some studies have raised important questions about the psychological implications of the excessive use of smartphones and other portable devices. Findings suggest that people who use smartphones too much can progressively develop cognitive impairments and attentional deficits, yet the factors contributing to these effects are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Hokkaido University recently carried out a study exploring the link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smartphone+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smartphone use&lt;/a&gt; and psychological processes, specifically looking at attention and physiological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00225-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that people who have an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/attentional+bias/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;attentional bias&lt;/a&gt; towards smartphone stimuli typically display a lower interoceptive awareness (i.e., they are less able to perceive and understand their bodily sensations) and are more physiologically reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This project began as an interdisciplinary exploration between philosophy and psychology, aiming to understand the relationship between technology and the human body," Yusuke Haruki, first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although digital devices like smartphones have become deeply embedded in our daily lives, we still know surprisingly little about how they shape our bodily awareness and perception. We became especially interested in how attention towards smartphone-related cues in everyday situations might influence our awareness of bodily sensations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruki and his colleagues drew parallels between excessive smartphone use and behavioral addictions, such as gambling and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Building on this parallel, they set out to explore how smartphone-related distractions are connected to body awareness (i.e., interoception) and physiological reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 58 healthy young adults and asked them to complete a simple visual task. The objective of this task was to rapidly spot target letters that were displayed on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the background of this task, we showed two types of images: smartphone-related images (such as a phone screen showing an incoming call) and control (scrambled) images," explained Haruki. "To understand if being distracted depended on how difficult the task was, we made the letter task easier or harder by changing how many target letters appeared on screen at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the time it took for participants to respond to stimuli (i.e., their reaction times) in these different conditions, the researchers divided them into two different groups, using a clustering method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group contained people who were consistently distracted by smartphone images, irrespective of how difficult the task was, while the second contained people who were only distracted by these images when the task was easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Next, we compared these two groups using questionnaires to see if the consistently distracted group reported lower awareness of their own bodily signals," said Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Finally, we also checked if this same group showed stronger heart rate increases when seeing smartphone images, indicating greater physiological reactivity to these cues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers found that even if smartphone-related images were irrelevant to the visual task they employed in their experiment, they captured the attention of approximately half of participants. These participants struggled to pay attention to the task at hand, while also exhibiting stronger &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physiological+reactions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physiological reactions&lt;/a&gt; when smartphone-related images appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Participants who were more distracted by smartphone cues not only performed worse on the attention task but also showed accelerated heart rates when exposed to these images," said Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, these individuals also reported lower interoceptive awareness, meaning they were less attuned to internal bodily signals such as their heartbeat—a pattern mirroring behavioral addictions like gambling or substance use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this recent study suggest that some people might find it hard to ignore stimuli originating from their smartphone, such as incoming calls, texts, emails, etc., both due to mental processes and their physiological responses. Haruki and his colleagues hope that the new insight they gathered will help to better understand the link between smartphone use, attention-related processes and bodily self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work could also potentially inform interventions aimed at promoting healthier digital habits, especially among younger populations," added Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our next studies, we plan to study what happens in the brain when people are distracted by smartphones, and how this pattern develops over time. We're especially interested in how these attentional patterns relate to brain activity and whether early signs can be found during adolescence or young adulthood."&lt;/p&gt;

Ozempic (and drugs like it) aren’t magic. They won’t lead to long-lasting weight loss if you take them while eating a diet consisting of nutrient-void, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ultra-processed-foods_l_66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="ultra-processed foods" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about the less obvious food rules you might not know about? In addition to changing the types of foods you eat, meal timing and portion size also are important to think about. And that’s not all. Here, bariatric physicians who prescribe these types of medications share the five most common food mistakes to avoid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 1: Not Reducing The Size Of Your Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you start taking a prescription weight loss medication,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr. Muhammad Ghanem," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr. Muhammad Ghanem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a bariatric surgeon with the Orlando Health Weight Loss and Bariatric Surgery Institute, told HuffPost that it’s best to transition from eating three big meals a day to smaller, more frequent ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know that sleepy feeling that hits you right after a big meal? Ghanem shared that this happens because a big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue). “All these spikes and drops in blood sugar and insulin cause insulin resistance, which causes weight gain. This is why small, frequent meals maintain a more steady blood sugar level, which means less insulin resistance, which means more weight loss,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Diala Alatassi," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Diala Alatassi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;an obesity medicine physician at Endeavor Health, shared another benefit of frequent, smaller meals — it can reduce unwanted side effects of weight loss medications. “Many weight loss medications slow gastric emptying, making large meals more likely to cause bloating, nausea and discomfort,” she said, adding that this is less likely to happen with smaller, more frequent meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dexter Turnquest," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Dexter Turnquest,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bariatric medical director at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that another benefit to eating smaller meals throughout the day is that it helps prevent hunger, which is what causes people to make unhealthy food decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 2: Not Getting Enough Protein, Fiber And Other Important Nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating smaller, more frequent meals may lead to less fatigue and unwanted side effects, but Ghanem said that it also can lead to not getting all the required nutrients the body needs. The biggest nutrient deficiency he sees in people taking weight loss medications is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-protein-to-eat_l_63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="protein" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;protein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Alatassi added to this, telling HuffPost that not getting enough protein can lead to muscle loss and slow metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But protein isn’t the only nutrient deficiency at risk on a weight loss medication. Obesity medicine specialist and bariatric surgeon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jihad Kudsi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Jihad Kudsi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-not-enough-fiber-digestions_l_66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is another important nutrient many people don’t get enough of. When this happens, he said, it can lead to constipation and negatively impact gut health. Other nutrients Kudsi said many people taking a weight loss medication often don’t get enough of include iron (particularly for women), vitamin B12, calcium and vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ensure you’re getting all the nutrients your body needs, see a registered dietitian to help you figure out the best way to hit all your nutrient buckets while eating frequent smaller meals. Additionally, Turnquest said it can be helpful to take a daily multivitamin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 3: Consuming Too Much Alcohol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a lot of emphasis on changing food habits after starting to take a weight loss medication, but it’s important to think about your drinking habits too — particularly with alcohol. While drinking alcohol in moderation is OK, Ghanem said, it’s important to avoid drinking too much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Alcohol can hinder your body's ability to counteract low blood sugars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“First, alcohol is a high-calorie drink. Second, alcohol can hinder your body’s ability to counteract low blood sugars. Weight loss medications also lower blood sugars, and this in turn can increase your chances of hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. Third, alcohol can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, and the medications do as well. This can aggravate those side effects,” Ghanem said. He also added that people with obesity are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at higher risk for fatty liver disease" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at higher risk for fatty liver disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and routinely drinking too much alcohol can be another blow to liver health, increasing the risk of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do decide to consume alcohol, Alatassi told HuffPost, it’s best to limit intake, stay hydrated and to avoid drinking on an empty stomach. This, she said, can decrease the chances of experiencing the negative side effects that are common with weight loss medications, like nausea and dizziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 4: Skipping Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re taking a weight loss medication, you may think that skipping meals can help you get to your goal weight easier. Coupled with the fact that weight loss medications suppress appetite, it can be extra tempting to skip meals. A word of advice straight from the doctors: Don’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Skipping meals can lead to unintended side effects and nutritional deficiencies. While these medications suppress appetite, the body still requires consistent nourishment to maintain energy levels, muscle mass and metabolic health,” Kudsi said. He added that prolonged fasting also can lead to overeating later in the day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alatassi added to this, saying that skipping meals can also increase the risk of muscle loss, which people taking a weight loss medication already are at an increased risk for. “Research has found that skipping meals is linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="poorer weight loss outcomes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poorer weight loss outcomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="metabolic imbalances" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;metabolic imbalances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, further reinforcing the need for a structured eating routine,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: eclipse_images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;eclipse_images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 5: Eating Too Close To Bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both Kudsi and Turnquest told HuffPost that one common mistake many people taking a weight loss medication make is eating too close to bedtime. “Eating too close to bedtime, especially high-fat or high-carb meals, can worsen acid reflux, which is a common concern for those on GLP-1 medications,” Kudsi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

It was also after Kennedy issued a statement in which he accurately said: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine,” which also provides protection against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy, an avowed vaccine skeptic helming the Trump administration’s response to a measles outbreak that has been steadily growing across the US, then &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/texas-measles-death-child" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; that conventional messaging by soon publishing another statement that lavished praise on a pair of unconventional practitioners who have eschewed the two-dose MMR shot in favor of vitamins and cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5d7b4898-b361-4c07-aa89-ad4f523126eb" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Robert F Kennedy Jr claims anti-vax physicians healed ‘some 300 measles-stricken children’","elementId":"5d7b4898-b361-4c07-aa89-ad4f523126eb","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The comments from Hildebrand provided a glimpse into how Kennedy simply demurred on vaccines – rather than express a position on them – during his first visit to the center of an outbreak that as of Monday had claimed three lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When asked for comment on Monday, Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not dispute Hildebrand’s claims that the agency’s leader was silent on Sunday about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It instead provided a link to Kennedy’s statement after the funeral, which read in part: “My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with [their] community in their moment of grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health experts have repeatedly said the MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent deaths or serious illness from measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet, during his brief interview on Monday, Hildebrand made clear that he stood by his skepticism of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I know it’s not effective because some family members ended up getting the vaccine, and they got the measles way worse than some of my kids,” said Hildebrand, who is raising two other children with his wife, Eva. “The vaccine was not effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Medical professionals have long established that getting an illness one was vaccinated against does not mean the vaccination failed. Vaccines also work by reducing the severity of illness – and, in some cases, can prevent death – should people catch the sickness they were immunized against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Daisy Hildebrand died last week at University medical center in Lubbock, Texas, about 80 miles (129km) away from her family’s home in the rural community of Seminole. Her doctors attributed her death to what they described as “measles pulmonary failure”, noting that she was not MMR-vaccinated and had no reported underlying conditions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Texas’s state health services department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She was the second young child from Seminole to die from measles in about five weeks. Kayley Fehr, who was also not given the MMR vaccine, died aged six in February after contracting measles and being hospitalized in Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated adult in Lea county, New Mexico, also died after contracting the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fehr was the first person in the US to die from measles since 2015. Measles had been declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but it has recently been spreading in undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Funeral services for Hildebrand and Fehr were held in the same Mennonite church in Seminole, which has a population of about 7,000, according to publicly available information. Many Mennonite communities – which tend to be close-knit – have historically been undervaccinated as they &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what they interpret to be medical freedom over vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children who get the MMR vaccine are typically given the first dose at 12-15 months. They usually get the second dose between ages four and six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Respectively, the shots are 93% and 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Diseases Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The west &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; county to which Seminole belongs, Gaines, has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state. Around the time of Hildebrand’s death, it had reported about 300 measles cases since January. That was more than 65% of the nearly 500 measles cases which had then been reported in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Friday, the US government was reporting more than 605 measles cases across 22 states for the year so far. At least 74 of those cases – roughly 12% – had led to hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma joined Texas as well as New Mexico in having active measles outbreaks, defined as three or more cases, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US reported 285 measles cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts have warned that the US’s collective outbreak could continue for several more months, if not for about a year. They have also said the US should prepare for more measles-related deaths without a more aggressive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US Senate’s health committee has summoned Kennedy to testify before the group on Thursday. Despite Kennedy’s well-documented vaccine skepticism, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm him as the national health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQbTNnT05mWHc4Zi1QeHdwcHNmLWJYWTYyWjJxU3YyaW00NE9ETFVhVm9YQkFJMzBRV05CUEp4NTJRUTBGcTU4WmgtaXJFTG1oQlQ0UG93dFZsS01Cd1ZTZFJ2VUxqVGdGRFBRd09KcnIyeHh5NW1oeU1FUVBkMldUTm1pTXZEbFkwbzgzMA</guid></item><item><title>Melting ice in the Arctic could unleash deadly 'zombie' viruses and trigger a new pandemic, climate scientists - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQRlI4MjFrNEN1czVyNER6RTZpTnJUNG1pTlNXRGVfTk9kc3RCX2R3MzFpRlBuYUMtZFJyekZqTjlNcXNCR3BXVElTYThheXF0NFh3UjQxQnhNMU81NGQzbEx5Xy1Od3RDZlE2bHhJR3hKdGk1X08zZzlocHhvQlQ4alYwN3dfcFB5cWN0VU5TVHhWRWpRQkJDMms2Z9IBoAFBVV95cUxNUDQxNlZXbVo4ejJuR1ZwaEFxektaTXNyMHVvb1pLeVRScVdlVWpObnozUWJ0N2tKMnJBTEg0WVRDdlJHMUZqUXJrQVVObTlHcXQxV3VhbVZ4cDBjdEVxQk9Mb3EySV81eFMycEJuckM3ZlV1NUIxUnhoeEhfRFdWX3FONG1IQWN6ZHdxSVFDeDZkci1iaXpobXpvSzZGalJz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-9f391270-1467-11f0-99f7-97e313d4de36"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; brought the world to a standstill back in 2020, thoughts have turned to what the next global pandemic could be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many scientists are focusing their research on a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14534011/disease-x-warning-pandemic-viruses.html"&gt;hypothetical future 'Disease X'.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to a new study, the answer could actually lie in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have warned that melting ice at the North Pole could unleash 'zombie' viruses with the potential to trigger a new pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These so-called 'Methuselah microbes' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as the climate warms and the permafrost thaws, scientists are now concerned that ancient diseases might infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-author Dr Khaled Abass, of the University of Sharjah, says: '&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-a6cc6910-1462-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt; is not only melting ice—it's melting the barriers between ecosystems, animals, and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Permafrost thawing could even release ancient bacteria or viruses that have been frozen for thousands of years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Melting ice and thawing permafrost in the Arctic could release a deadly 'zombie virus' and start the next pandemic, scientists have warned. Pictured: Scientists walk over the thawing Greenland icecap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So-called 'Methuselah microbes' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years. Scientists have managed to revive some of these ancient diseases in the lab, including this Pithovirus sibericum that was isolated from a 30,000-year-old sample of permafrost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glaciers can also store huge numbers of frozen viruses. As scientists predict that the world's glaciers will vanish by 2100, there are concerns that these ancient pathogens could be released &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For over a decade, scientists known that bacteria and viruses frozen in the Arctic could still have the potential to infect living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, scientists isolated viruses from the Siberian permafrost &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/article-6923367/Thawing-Siberian-permafrost-anthrax-prehistoric-diseases-come-life.html"&gt;and showed they could still infect living cells despite being frozen for thousands of years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, in 2023, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12988837/Arctic-zombie-viruses-Siberia-one-day-released-Earths-warming-climate-trigger-new-pandemic-scientists-warn.html"&gt;scientists successfully revived an amoeba virus that had been frozen for 48,500 years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the risks are not limited to permafrost regions, as dormant pathogens can also be found in large bodies of ice such as glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13793979/ancient-viruses-discovered-melting-ice.html"&gt; scientists found 1,700 ancient viruses lurking deep inside a glacier &lt;/a&gt;in western China, most of which have never been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses date back as far as 41,000 years and have survived three major shifts from cold to warm climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these viruses are safe so long as they remain buried in the permafrost, the big concern for climate scientists is that they may not remain that way for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When ice or permafrost is disturbed or melts, any microbes inside are released into the environment - many of which could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The bodies of frozen animals like mammoths or woolly rhinoceros (pictured) can harbour ancient organisms which survive in a dormant state. When these animals are disturbed or thaw, the microbes are released &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some of these microbes have the potential to be dangerous, such as Pacmanvirus lupus (pictured) which was found thawing from the 27,000-year-old intestines of a frozen Siberian wolf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sciencetech" data-version="2" id="mol-aac6c830-1462-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14583035/Melting-ice-Arctic-zombie-viruses.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Which zombie viruses could be released?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox"&gt;Influenza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Scientists have found strains of influenza in the lungs of frozen victims from as far back as 1918.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox"&gt;Pithovirus sibericum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Despite being frozen for 30,000 years the virus was still infectious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox"&gt;Mollivirus sibericum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;While not a threat to humans and animals, scientists found this virus can survive for thousands of years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox"&gt;Pandoravirus and Megavirus mammoth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;These viruses were found in a clump of frozen mammoth wool and are able to infect both human and mouse cells. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox"&gt;'Wolf' virus - Pacmanvirus lupus &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;An ancient relative of African swine fever virus, this was found thawing from the 27,000-year-old intestines of frozen Siberian wolf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, researchers discovered an ancient relative of African swine fever virus, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Pacmanvirus lupus&lt;/span&gt; was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12153881/Six-zombie-viruses-unleashed-world-right-climate-change.html"&gt;found thawing from the 27,000-year-old intestines of frozen Siberian wolf.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite having been frozen since the Middle Stone Age, this virus was still capable of infecting and killing amoebas in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that four sextillion - that's four followed by 21 zeros - cells escape permafrost every year at current rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While researchers estimate that only one in 100 ancient pathogens could disrupt the ecosystem, the sheer volume of microbes escaping makes a dangerous incident more likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016, for example,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-3720376/Boy-13-dies-90-affected-Russian-anthrax-outbreak-thawed-reindeer-meat.html"&gt; anthrax spores escaped from an animal carcass&lt;/a&gt; that had been frozen in the Siberian permafrost for 75 years, leaving dozens hospitalized and one child dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet the bigger risk is that the disease becomes established in the animal population, where increasing contact with humans makes it more likely that the disease will jump into humans as a 'zoonotic' disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, about three-quarters of all known human infections are zoonotic, including those found in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a zoonotic disease emerged from a dormant state in the frozen Arctic, our bodies might not have the defences needed to fight an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists warn that pathogens from frozen animals, such as this 39,500-year-old cave bear from Siberia, could jump to modern species. If this happened, there is a serious risk of humans becoming infected by the ancient disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Arctic is an especially dangerous region for zoonotic diseases because health monitoring services are so limited. The researchers point out that diseases like Toxoplasma gondii are already spreading widely through people and animals in the region (illustrated)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of infection could lead to a particularly dangerous and hard-to-control pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Abbas says: 'Climate change and pollution are affecting both animal and human health—our research looked into how these two forces are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the Arctic warms faster than most other parts of the world, we're seeing changes in the environment—like melting permafrost and shifting ecosystems—that could help spread infectious diseases between animals and people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that Arctic regions are an especially dangerous starting point for a pandemic since the region has so little medical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health and research services are limited, meaning a disease may spread widely before the authorities have the chance to react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Already, the researchers point out that zoonotic diseases such as Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii have spread throughout the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Abbas cautions that what is happening in the Arctic 'doesn't stay in the Arctic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The environmental stressors we studied have ripple effects that reach far beyond the polar regions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-982c9580-1460-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-92da8620-0c28-11e8-9ae0-6f3a2e2268ae" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5363711/WHAT-PERMAFROST.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer below the Earth's surface found in Arctic regions such as Alaska, Siberia and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically consists of soil, gravel and sand bound together by ice, and is classified as ground that has remained below 0°C (32°F) for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated 1,500 billion tons of carbon is stored in the world's permafrost - more than twice the amount found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The carbon comes in the form of ancient vegetation and soil that has remained frozen for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If global warming were to melt the world's permafrost, it could release thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because some permafrost regions have stayed frozen for thousands of years, it is of particular interest for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ancient remains found in permafrost are among the most complete ever found because the ice stops organic matter from decomposing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A number of 2,500-year-old bodies buried in Siberia by a group of nomads known as the Scythians have been found with their tattooed skin still intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A baby mammoth corpse uncovered on Russia's Arctic coast in 2010 still sported clumps of its hair despite being more than 39,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is also used in the study of Earth's geological history as soil and minerals buried deep in Arctic regions for thousands of years can be dug up and studied today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:53:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQRlI4MjFrNEN1czVyNER6RTZpTnJUNG1pTlNXRGVfTk9kc3RCX2R3MzFpRlBuYUMtZFJyekZqTjlNcXNCR3BXVElTYThheXF0NFh3UjQxQnhNMU81NGQzbEx5Xy1Od3RDZlE2bHhJR3hKdGk1X08zZzlocHhvQlQ4alYwN3dfcFB5cWN0VU5TVHhWRWpRQkJDMms2Z9IBoAFBVV95cUxNUDQxNlZXbVo4ejJuR1ZwaEFxektaTXNyMHVvb1pLeVRScVdlVWpObnozUWJ0N2tKMnJBTEg0WVRDdlJHMUZqUXJrQVVObTlHcXQxV3VhbVZ4cDBjdEVxQk9Mb3EySV81eFMycEJuckM3ZlV1NUIxUnhoeEhfRFdWX3FONG1IQWN6ZHdxSVFDeDZkci1iaXpobXpvSzZGalJz</guid></item><item><title>How to track down your childhood vaccination records in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware - WHYY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPVjI2dUJpVmRid3BIMjE1aU5nVHQ1NDUwbEhnM09GR21Ra2pUTEY4dmlmTFFCTHcyUUg3Ri13eU14ZjF3LTJfRW9OSkVrZGFPNklXOHdIc1lVU3BwdkFwbTQ1YjVLY2N4REhHQkxaMUZkLWlvX2lpbE1zS0N3UGs1UTNOVU11WWNLdHVQZGN1Q1FuMTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="flexible-content-container wysiwyg-styles"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, there’s only been a &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/bucks-county-measles-case/"&gt;handful of measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the Philadelphia region, but peak summer travel season is fast approaching.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts urge people planning to visit areas with &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/measles-virus-contagious-airborne-infection/"&gt;larger infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks to check their vaccination status, which may require locating their childhood immunization records.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with your health care provider will definitely help with keeping your records available in centralized areas so that you can make sure that you’re up to date as best as possible,” said New Jersey Department of Health State Epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vaccines for diseases like hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and polio are given &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;during infancy and early childhood&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, those shots are recorded in electronic health records systems, but for many older adults, their vaccine histories were kept in paper files that may have been damaged, destroyed or lost to time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you cannot find your vaccine records, you might need to get some of your vaccines again,” Tan said. “That’s not necessarily ideal, but it is definitely safe to repeat vaccines.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going straight to the source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things people can try before they consider getting revaccinated. They can first check with their childhood pediatricians’ offices or current primary health care providers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These offices may still have the paper records, or they’ve converted them into digital files.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people have been pregnant, you probably have been tested for certain protection against certain vaccine-preventable diseases, so your obstetrician’s office might also have that information,” Tan said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this might not be an option for everyone. In states like Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, health providers are only&lt;a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf"&gt; required to keep&lt;/a&gt; medical records of former patients for a minimum of seven years after the last appointment. Then, they can be destroyed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other practitioners and offices may no longer be in business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those cases, Tan said people can check if their childhood vaccine records are on file with schools and colleges that often request documentation for incoming students.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The military, if you were enlisted, might have records of the immunization as well,” she said.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHYY</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPVjI2dUJpVmRid3BIMjE1aU5nVHQ1NDUwbEhnM09GR21Ra2pUTEY4dmlmTFFCTHcyUUg3Ri13eU14ZjF3LTJfRW9OSkVrZGFPNklXOHdIc1lVU3BwdkFwbTQ1YjVLY2N4REhHQkxaMUZkLWlvX2lpbE1zS0N3UGs1UTNOVU11WWNLdHVQZGN1Q1FuMTA</guid></item><item><title>A psychologist and biologist debate the significance of testosterone - Aeon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOVHIwNkU5VTI2VHpCSmFlY2ZaanZnX1VfTmdvVnNiYWZmeWVMaUs5VWM5YVNCSzMxZmJvQUZMTGJ0WmtmaE02RFg5aVN0a0YyZ1hZeUJScnNZTFhubFdqdnZvTlRJcUtzOFlYTUZqRldhcURSY04wRXhiZERja2tqcjZfTTgzT0w2VlBXTllONzNMQU5aSkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-4ebaf8b7-2 cLLLmT has-dropcap"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does biology determine destiny, or is society the dominant cause of masculine and feminine traits? In this spirited exchange, the psychologist Cordelia Fine and the evolutionary biologist Carole Hooven unpack the complex relationship between testosterone and human behaviour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fine emphasises variability, flexibility and context – seeing gender as shaped by social forces as much as it is by hormones. By contrast, Hooven stresses consistent patterns; while acknowledging the influence of culture and the differences between individuals, she maintains that biology explains why certain sex-linked behaviours persist across cultures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;At stake in this debate is how we understand ourselves and organise our communities. Can we achieve equality by changing cultural norms, or must we accommodate biological realities that evolution has inscribed in our brains? As you read, notice how these scholars interpret the same evidence through fundamentally different frameworks – revealing why discussions about sex differences remain both scientifically complex and politically charged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cordelia Fine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;isk-taking, dominance, aggressive jostling for status – many of us are familiar with the idea that these masculine traits can be largely chalked-up to testosterone. Take this description of the dangerous, male-dominated environment of an oil platform in the 1980s, where one worker compared his colleagues to ‘a pack of lions’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The guy that was in charge was the one who could basically out-perform and out-shout and out-intimidate all the others. That’s just how it worked out here on drilling rigs and in production. So those people went to the top, over other people’s bodies in some cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then something changed. In the early 1990s, the company overhauled their policies and practices on the rig to enhance safety and effectiveness – and, in doing so, inadvertently created an environment that ‘released’ these men from displays of masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unexpected effect was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191308510000079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; by the organisational scholars Robin Ely and Debra Meyerson, who observed the pattern play out on two offshore oil platforms. For the first time, workers started to acknowledge their own physical limits, admit their mistakes, and discuss their own and others’ emotions. A deck mechanic sent a classical music tape home for a coworker’s baby, saying that ‘it’s real important for them babies to listen to music like that. Real soothing.’ When a researcher tipped his chair back in a meeting, he was politely told: ‘That’s not safe.’ Men openly displayed fear when evacuated after 9/11. ‘We are a very different group now than we were when we first got together – kinder, gentler people,’ one production operator said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No part of the company’s strategy involved dispensing androgen blockers to change levels of testosterone in men’s bodies. But it did involve a change of organisational culture. The focus was on collective goals, admitting and learning from errors, and disentangling notions of competence from displays of machismo. Asked to reflect on what being a man meant to them, the workers ended up describing manliness in non-stereotyped ways, often drawing on ideas of approachability, compassion and humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case study belongs to a robust body of evidence that makes me sceptical of the significance of testosterone. Sceptical, that is, that this hormone is the root cause of the many gendered differences in behaviour that we see in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take a step back, and describe what I call ‘Testosterone Rex’. This is my tongue-in-cheek phrase for the seductive, seemingly undefeatable notion that men and women have distinct natures, in large part due to the basic, powerful, pervasive and direct effect of testosterone. In this account, ‘T’ becomes the potent, hormonal essence of competitive, risk-taking masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone Rex appears in many forms. Its starting point is what the anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has called the ‘coy female’ paradigm – the idea that asymmetries in what it costs females versus males to have babies make males more motivated by mating success. Males potentially invest as little as a sperm, while females contribute a nice plump egg and, in mammals, full bed-and-board in utero and lactation. Over evolutionary time, this means males will develop traits that help them fight for access to females, and appear more appealing to females browsing for their next mate. Testosterone furnishes both the physical and behavioural traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This popular Testosterone Rex story is too simple. Both evolution and testosterone allow for a much greater diversity and flexibility of sex roles than previously (and popularly) appreciated – especially in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the ‘developmental system’ can help us grasp this flexibility. The idea here is that creatures don’t just inherit genes, but also ecological, social and (in our own case) cultural legacies. These are all inherited resources. Evolution can ‘use’ stable, non-genetic legacies, in addition to genetic ones, to make sure that behavioural adaptations develop and get passed on across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Along with our genes, we inherit our rich, cumulative cultures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the California mouse, where, unusually for mammals, both parents care for their offspring. Fathers’ tendency to ‘huddle and groom’ their babies is influenced by testosterone in an interesting way: castration &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467882/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; paternal care, while testosterone replacement restores it. Moreover, sons raised in a family unit with castrated, less involved fathers went on to &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.0824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; less pup huddling and grooming themselves when they became fathers (despite being ‘intact’). This all suggests that an organism’s environment and experiences can be a stable, inherited resource, contributing to the lifelong development of adaptive traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique aspect of human developmental systems are our rich, cumulative cultures, which we inherit along with our genes. Thousands of years of gendered cultures, together with our evolved and unparalleled capacity for social learning, might have reduced the need for genes to be the ‘carriers’ of sex-linked behavioural features. Instead, as John Dupré, Daphna Joel and I have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28821346/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, these traits could stabilise through norms that tell us what it means to be a woman or a man, and that are transferred across generations. If a male California mouse reliably inherits a father who will huddle and groom him, that’s a developmental resource that doesn’t have to be redundantly locked into genetically inherited biology. And if a male human reliably inherits a rich gendered culture that provides ample information and instruction about how to be man, along with minds tuned to acquire, enforce and internalise those norms, there’s much less need for genetic mechanisms to enforce the development of gendered traits, beyond a neural capacity for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such cultures come about in response to the pressures of particular times and places in our evolutionary history – which means we can and should modify them when circumstances require, as we’ve always done. On the developmental systems view, changing the environment (something at which humans obviously excel) can change the expression of masculine and feminine behaviour, without the need for millennia of slow genetic change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all points to the fact that testosterone isn’t the ‘essence’ of masculinity. My target here isn’t the crude and patently false idea that all men are like this, and all women are like that. It’s the notion that, amid all the noise of individual differences, we can extract a male ‘nature’ that is somehow natural, immutable, and driven by testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that I think humans are completely unaffected by hormones, including testosterone? Of course not. But even in nonhuman animals, testosterone is just one variable in a complex system, one of many factors that feeds into an animal’s decision-making. Social context and experience can override T’s influence on behaviour, or even stand in for T’s absence. Moreover, T responds to contexts and situations, helping us adapt to them. This means that how much T a body has, and how it reacts to it, are inextricably intertwined with the individual’s history and experience – including, in our own case, the influence of gender norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but I know you take quite a different line, Carole. Thank you for being open to unravelling our disagreements together. These points of divergence about sex differences are often attributed to politics but, in my view, they have far more to do with the conceptual frameworks people bring to the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carole Hooven:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ordelia, you represent the idea that testosterone explains a lot about human sex differences as &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;‘T-Rex’:&lt;/span&gt; a dinosaur that gets it wrong, and should die, never to rear its head again. I agree that &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; is a complicated beast; but he has many moments of clarity where he gets the science basically right. And I will do what I can to keep that more sensible &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do agree on some things – such as the value of reproductive autonomy, a world free of the threat of male violence, and flexibility of gender expression. I also agree that one’s environment profoundly affects behaviour. I (like every other biologist) don’t think sex differences in behaviour are immutable or invariant, or that testosterone can create sexed ‘essences’ or ‘natures’ that separate the behaviour of the sexes into two discrete categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our substantive disagreements are about the origins of sex differences. You see testosterone as one variable in the complex system of human behaviour. I see unambiguous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30892813/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it can account for some of the large and extremely impactful differences between men and women, particularly when it comes to sexual psychology and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the case study of men on an oil rig. The authors described the change in stereotypically masculine behaviour, catalysed by workplace policies, as ‘undoing gender’. If such behaviour is the result of evolutionary forces, with high testosterone carrying out their orders, then ‘gender’ should be resistant to undoing. That is, how could the men soften so dramatically without hormone blockers? This seems like very strong evidence against my claims. Shouldn’t I just throw in the towel right here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. Workplace changes on the oil rigs reduced stereotypically masculine behaviour in men; but this doesn’t undermine the view that differences between the sexes in traits like aggression (or anything else) originate in differences in inherited biology. Let me explain with an example. Imagine you’re trying to enjoy a meal at a fancy restaurant, but are distracted by a toddler at the next table screaming and banging silverware. Such disruptive behaviour is common among young children. However, if you go out to dinner in Japan or France, you’re likely to notice that the little diners are more restrained than their counterparts in the US. That’s not due to differences in innate biology; instead, it’s due to the fact that kids, like the rest of us, can modify their behaviour in response to incentives. This is despite having what we might think of as a distinct ‘nature’ – that is, different behavioural predispositions on average – from adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;To establish dominance, male elephant seals will bite and ram each other with their huge bodies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to &lt;a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/carole-hooven-2/testosterone/9781788403092/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; is not whether culture influences aggression in men, but why, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.8.4.291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;across cultures&lt;/a&gt;, men are more aggressive than women in the first place. This is a pattern that varies in form and extent, but rarely reverses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To flesh out my view, I should say a few words about sexual selection – a form of natural selection in which traits that help animals attract mates and reproduce are passed on at relatively high frequency to future generations. Males tend to reap higher reproductive rewards from successfully competing for mates. That means sexual selection tends to be stronger in males, though it acts on females too. This leads to the evolution of more pronounced traits in males that promote mating competition, such as brighter colours, stronger bodies, or a higher propensity for aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/eBBMNsGFYpE" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual selection in male &lt;a href="http://www.eleseal.org/res/res_size.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;elephant seals&lt;/a&gt; is notoriously strong. They compete intensely for control of beaches where females come to give birth and mate. To establish dominance, they will bite and ram each other with their huge bodies, which can weigh up to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;4 tonnes&lt;/span&gt; (around four times the average weight of females). The battles can go on for hours, but successful dominant bulls, identifiable by the cuts and scars on their chests, will mate with dozens of females who will bear their pups. Higher &lt;a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1984.tb02326.x?casa_token=FcT5P16XPi4AAAAA%3AlsqqTko19rhU8MtlEKHt0_J63M8LOLGCsMolS_SbO6kjNV_VUxC318s2YONAulsJGBpFMOrbIb_m5hY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; in males is a major tool, the proximate mechanism, for developing and regulating many of these traits, including making sperm, which all support reproduction. So, when it comes to behavioural sex differences, testosterone is not simply a variable in a complex system; on the contrary, its actions, shaped by sexual selection, are often the key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​​This doesn’t mean that men spend their lives trying to tear each other apart. We are not a highly polygynous species like the elephant seal, in which lots of fierce aggression is a sensible reproductive strategy. All animals use aggression judiciously, but it depends on the costs versus the rewards for particular animals in a given environment. And the same is true for us. In humans – who are arguably mildly polygynous – individual proclivities for aggression vary widely, but males still have a heightened propensity for it. Given enough alcohol, an honour-based culture, the right kind of threat or the ready availability of guns, it will show itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordelia, your work emphasises the &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; effects of testosterone on behaviour via bodily changes and gender socialisation. For example, male-typical levels produce a big, strong, bepenised body, which then influences how others treat you – expecting ‘masculine’ behaviour, being granted social status, or access to food or mates. These experiences in turn shape psychology and brain development, reciprocally interacting with testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all true; but it is completely consistent with the robust scientific evidence that testosterone has a direct and tremendously meaningful effect on behaviour via the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945220301465?casa_token=Hn2_pxqbgB4AAAAA%3APeTwv66C0Qs_pLEVf1xJBM6pIquOP2UjSjE_En7noto0nJceGFyQHu4_wjORudcvKm7Cb_E7xQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; too – an idea that you criticise strongly. But sexual selection would not sculpt males with bigger, stronger bodies if it hadn’t also selected for psychological traits that leveraged this strength to bring sperm &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to egg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is what coordinates sperm production with the vastly complex physical and psychological traits that are necessary to get sperm to egg, and when advantageous, to invest in one’s mate and offspring after that. In men, testosterone directs the development of primary reproductive traits such as the genitalia, and secondary sexual features such as muscularity and a deep voice. The hormone is in an excellent &lt;a href="https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/roney/james/COPSYC3.published.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;position&lt;/a&gt; to tell the brain what the body is up to – such as whether sperm is currently being made or fertile females are available, such that males are motivated to do what’s necessary to mate when that effort will pay genetic rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many complexities in how sexual selection and testosterone shape human sex differences. But they don’t merit killing off the more sensible versions of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cordelia Fine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;et me recap what I understand your position, and the ‘sensible’ &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; approach, to be. Stronger sexual selection on males gave rise to masculine physical and psychological traits that facilitate male competition for mates, status and resources. Testosterone ties all this together, making it ‘the hormone that dominates and divides us’, as you’ve written in your 2021 book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this view of things, the imbalance in how much males and females must invest to reproduce – which becomes particularly marked when you throw in gestation and lactation in mammals – is the key to understanding sex roles across the animal kingdom. Maleness, here, becomes a sort of ‘essence’ that determines specific behavioural predispositions of the male sex role. You’ve mentioned bull seals, and in your book you wrote about male red deer, male mountain spiny lizards, male Syrian hamsters and male chimpanzees. As you frame it, they all seem to possess this kind of ‘essence’, and so will develop to have those ‘masculine’ predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how could humans, with our nine-month pregnancies and long periods of breastfeeding on one side of the ledger, versus one measly sperm on the other, be any different? The answer is: because there are many exceptions to this pattern across the animal kingdom, both across species and within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our divergent perspectives likely stem from the different lenses we’re using: you prioritise cross-species tendencies, while I focus on documenting variability, and am interested in what that could mean for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Sex is indeed important for explaining the evolution of mating systems. But it’s part of a diverse picture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the ‘coy female’ idea, which is more politely described as the Darwin-Bateman paradigm. It dates back to foundational empirical &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy194821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; with fruit flies by the biologist Angus Bateman in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;mid-20th century.&lt;/span&gt; But the paradigm has come under significant criticism in the scientific community. Statistical reanalysis and critique have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17725639/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; Bateman’s conclusions. Meanwhile, evolutionary biologists have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2016.1150938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; more about phenomena such as the reproductive benefits to some species’ females of promiscuity and status, and the non-trivial costs to males of sperm production and distribution. Even among primates, purported universals like the link between male dominance and reproductive success are better understood as general patterns rather than immutable laws. There is good evidence that sexual selection varies not only between but also within species, as a function of demography and environment. Some biologists even &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.2126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt; for radical ‘sex-neutral’ models of sex roles – &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/22/6/1142/219204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proposing&lt;/a&gt; that mating behaviour is determined by probabilistic, random processes, as well as ecological, social and demographic conditions, and that sex plays no role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I disagree with those radical sex-neutral models. I don’t view the Darwin-Bateman paradigm as obsolete. The evidence suggests that sex is indeed an important concept for explaining the evolution of mating systems. But it’s part of a remarkably diverse picture, pointing to multiple ‘counter-forces’ that can push against the evolution of conventional sex roles, as my colleague John Dupré has &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4975.1986.tb00508.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important takeaway of this diversity of sex roles across species is that we need to be cautious when generalising findings to humans. Every species has its own evolutionary history when it comes to solving the problem of reproduction, and our own evolutionary pathway is a unique one – not least the cumulative culture and social learning I mentioned before. On my account, cultural norms don’t just ‘dial up or dial down’ evolved traits. They can help to construct them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whither testosterone? On my account, gender and other social constructions are not an alternative explanation to internal mechanisms of sexual selection such as hormones; they are additional mechanisms, and often work together. If our culture tells us that a man’s honour is everything, a man’s testosterone will rise when he is insulted by a stranger. But if he was raised with different masculine norms, his testosterone levels will remain unchanged. If &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/swedens-hands-on-dads-and-the-hormones-of-fatherhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hands-on fathering&lt;/a&gt; is a norm, more men will be active carers for their young children – an activity associated with declines in testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our social worlds intersect with our biology. Testosterone’s impacts are not pre-programmed by evolution but guided by the meanings humans attach to behaviours, dynamically tuning behaviour within a cultural framework. This is profoundly different to the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; idea that gender norms can either ramp up or ramp down an evolutionarily ‘intended’ behavioural outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carole Hooven:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ordelia, your response opened with your take on my view, beginning with the ‘sensible’ &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; version: that ‘the imbalance in how much males and females must invest to reproduce … is the key to understanding sex roles across the animal kingdom.’ So far, so good. This is a &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-98307-040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that I enthusiastically endorse, and which you think is one that should be killed off; so here we have a strikingly clear point of disagreement. We’re getting somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You acknowledge that sex is an important variable for understanding mating, and you don’t endorse radical sex-neutral theories. But then you take &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; (and me along with him) head-first into straw-man territory. This is where maleness is described as ‘a sort of “essence” that determines … predispositions of the male sex role.’ What serious biologist thinks this? My view is that the sexes are born (on average, as always) with different predispositions, leading to what are called ‘traditional sex roles’, which &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; gets right. This pattern, of females being more nurturing and males being more competitive, applies to our own species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, men’s strength and relative reproductive freedom makes it easier for them to take physically demanding jobs that require long stays away from home, while women might take more work inside the home in order to be closer to, and nurse, young children. So, while a gendered culture influences how these traditional roles play out, I don’t see the evidence that it imposes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, science also tells us the many fascinating stories of ‘non-traditional’ sex roles! Some men aren’t interested in mating with women, and some transition to living in a female social role. Others are peace-loving devoted fathers and husbands. I wouldn’t presume that these men are repressing a predisposition to be bellicose womanisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Sex roles are influenced by the most basic division of labour: making eggs or making sperm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are what we might call the ‘&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/134/3/525/6357233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sex-reversed&lt;/a&gt;’ species, which Charles Darwin discussed in &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex &lt;/em&gt;(1871). One example that comes to mind is the shorebird known as the red-necked phalarope, in which the males do nearly all of the parenting, while females are larger and brighter, and compete aggressively for mates.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Emily Weiser/USGS/public domain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exceptions like the phalarope that prove the rule: for the sex that invests the least in parenting, competition for access to mates is often more fierce than the other way around. That results in greater sexual selection pressure operating on the less investing parent, producing physical and behavioural strategies for out-competing each other for access to mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than having a &lt;a href="https://www.realityslaststand.com/p/citations-for-the-gamete-based-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body plan&lt;/a&gt; to produce small gametes, there is no ‘male (or female) essence’. There are no ‘intended’ sexed-natures. There are, however, sex roles that are influenced by the most basic division of labour: making eggs (investing more in parenting) or sperm (investing more in competing for mates). That initial division has resulted in the evolution of traditional sex roles. Bateman’s theory was &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/77/11/2420/7250839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;correct&lt;/a&gt; (although his research was flawed): promiscuous mating does, on average, yield greater reproductive benefits for males than females. The fact that there are many exceptions to and variation in those roles – especially in our own species – is not a reason to believe that we are exceptions to the general rule. What makes us exceptional is that, regardless of our biological impulses, we can reflect on, and even discuss, what we believe and how we want to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we could zoom in to look at the case of aggression in more depth. I’d love to know if you agree with the consensus view of evolutionary biologists: that testosterone, given its evolutionary instructions by sexual selection, drives higher rates of aggressive competition in male mammals. If we agree on this, then we can focus on whether the same principles and processes apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cordelia Fine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;our question illustrates the differences between our approaches. You work from the frame that there is a general ‘principle’ that testosterone drives sex differences in aggression in mammals. You expect humans to conform to that principle, and interpret the weak and ambiguous evidence from humans on the relationship between hormones and aggression through this lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I am interested in the diversity we see across species, and the reasons to expect humans’ capacities for social learning and culture to play a key role in development and evolution. From this frame, the absence of clear evidence (despite decades of attempts to find it) for associations between physical aggression and testosterone exposure – prenatally, at puberty, or any changes post-puberty – is telling us something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always be cautious not to treat sex-correlated patterns as a ‘general rule’, including the related assumption that sex always gets its ‘work’ done in the same way across species. (The California mouse, mentioned earlier, is a nice example of a surprising evolved role for testosterone.) We know that the mechanisms that bring about an adaptive behaviour in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;species A&lt;/span&gt; may be quite different to the causes that bring about the same behaviour in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;species B.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, research on mice clearly shows testosterone’s causal role in male aggression – it increases at puberty, castration reduces it, and injections restore it. However, as the aggression researchers John Archer and Justin Carré &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315524696-12/testosterone-aggression-john-archer-justin-carr%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;, ‘the neuroendocrine control of aggression is different in a number of the species that have been studied.’ Different species do things differently. In humans, some scientists have shifted towards models in which changes in testosterone adaptively tune competitive or nurturing responses to relevant contexts. Moreover, human social structures and cultural norms both construct and give meaning to these contexts. Recall the offshore oil platform – does status and respect come from dominance, or from being open, honest and willing to listen to coworkers? The general point is that we need to be very careful about generalising across species, and we need to account for the specificity of their developmental systems – beyond genes and hormones. Our own developmental systems are rich in social constructions of gender that interact with ‘self-socialising’ tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;My argument is not with evolutionary biology but with essentialist thinking creeping in via the back door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that there are strong sex-correlated patterns across species. One influential &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26933680/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 66 animal species, for example, found that sexual selection was stronger on males than females as a whole – but also noted many exceptions, and acknowledged the role of ecological and demographic factors. In some human populations, these conditions meant sexual selection was similarly strong on both sexes. Whichever way sexual selection leans, it surely operates via a range of mechanisms that respond to social, material and physical conditions – and, in the case of humans, economic and cultural ones. And since the development and transfer of adaptive traits relies on the entire developmental system, not just the genes, relevant changes in non-genetic features of the system can bring about significant shifts in gendered behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why the question of whether male promiscuity, risk-taking and competitiveness were sexually selected adaptations for reproductive success simply doesn’t have the implications for now and the future that we usually assume they do. Nor does it necessarily mean that a hormonal endowment prefigures the male brain for these traits (although that’s not to deny the likelihood of sex-differentiated initial ‘tilts’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final important note about this idea of ‘essences’. I appreciate that contemporary evolutionary biologists recognise the diversity of mating systems, and don’t think of sex as an essence that underpins a ‘natural law’ across the animal kingdom of coy females and competitive males. But my argument is not with contemporary evolutionary biology. My objection is with the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; view, in which essentialist thinking creeps in via the back door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it’s clear in your response to the oil platform case study that you regard the men’s earlier stereotypically masculine behaviour as somehow more ‘natural’ than their behaviour post-intervention. Such sex differences, you say, ‘originate’ in inherited biology, which culture can only influence. To explain the expression of more feminine traits in these men, you offer the analogy of the ‘distinct “nature”’ of children being tempered with incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I both agree that there’s variation in behaviour among the sexes and overlap between them. The disagreement concerns how to explain these patterns. The famously essentialist philosopher Aristotle accounted for variation in nature as the combined product of underlying &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/blame-it-on-aristotle-how-science-got-into-bed-with-sexism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;natural tendencies&lt;/a&gt; and interfering forces of various degrees and kinds. In other words, distinct natural tendencies can nonetheless give rise to plenty of overlap in phenotype. Translated to sex differences in behaviour, this doesn’t seem so different from the views you expressed on Joe Rogan’s podcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My book &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; is not trying to explain why males are one way and females are another way, but why we’re different on average, why we have somewhat different natures, and testosterone is to me the most powerful way to understand those differences in our natures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/3LL3Sd2eAZY" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while you might think I’m taking aim at a straw man, I am targeting a view held by you and others that, under the veil of variation within and overlap between the sexes, testosterone is an essence that underpins male nature – making men what they are, while cultural forces can only attempt to interfere with or &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;derail it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carole Hooven:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I &lt;/span&gt;closed my last response by asking whether you agree ‘that testosterone, given its evolutionary instructions by sexual selection, drives higher rates of aggressive competition in male mammals.’ I then suggested that, if we agree on this, we can focus on whether those ideas apply to humans. If we disagreed, then we could have &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;examined why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of answering my question, you chose to engage with an ‘essentialist’ version of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex,&lt;/span&gt; rather than my own views. Ideally, I would reply to your comments and cautions about the science, as well as correct the record, but I have space only for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said my question revealed a ‘general principle’ that I supposedly endorse, and to which I expect humans to conform: that testosterone drives sex differences in aggression in mammals. But I worded my question to you carefully, so that we could pinpoint our areas of disagreement. I do endorse the idea that testosterone drives the sexes apart in many ways in many species, but that’s quite different from holding a blunt ‘general principle’ that I apply across the board to all sex differences in all mammals. It’s true that mammals provide clear examples of how and why sexual selection &lt;em&gt;tends&lt;/em&gt; to act more strongly on males, and that, in those cases, testosterone drives the expression of those sexually selected adaptations for male mating competition. However, as for the existence of a &lt;em&gt;general principle&lt;/em&gt; that testosterone drives sex differences in mammalian aggression (rather than driving &lt;em&gt;higher rates of aggressive competition in male mammals&lt;/em&gt;, as I wrote), that is not what I argue. For example, in my book &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, I describe species such as naked mole rats, hyenas and meerkats, in which females are often more aggressive than males. In these cases, sex differences in testosterone don’t clearly predict sex differences in aggressive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;What is ‘stereotypical’ in one environment may not be in another: men might express more vulnerability in Canada than in Russia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did operate from the general principle you describe, and if I expected that principle to apply to humans, your repeated cautions about overgeneralising and failing to appreciate diversity would be warranted. But, again, this isn’t how I think, nor have written or taught (for more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20 years)&lt;/span&gt; about hormones and behaviour. As I described &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike rats, our genes are expressed within the context of a complex cultural environment, interwoven with diverse norms and practices that significantly affect the behaviour of interest. We live in a culture that often requires us, explicitly or implicitly, to conform to gender norms in one way or another. So of course we still need to test our hypotheses on humans to draw any firm conclusions about how we work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, generate evidence-based hypotheses, and make predictions about outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ve created a narrative based on my opening comments – about the oil rig case study and my analogy about young diners – that appears to provide evidence for my ostensible belief in ‘distinct’ male and female ‘natures’, sexed ‘essences’ and some masculine behaviours being more ‘natural’ than others. These simply are not my positions. If you read back over my replies, you’ll see I wrote that &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt; may have a ‘distinct “nature” – that is, &lt;em&gt;different behavioural predispositions on average – from adults&lt;/em&gt;’ (italics added). I hope I was clear that cultural norms can modify how behavioural predispositions are expressed. This means not just that kids can learn to behave in restaurants, despite being different from adults. It also means that what is ‘stereotypical’ in one environment may not be in another; for example, women fleeing violence might be more stoic than when safe in the suburbs with their families, and men might express more vulnerability in Canada than Russia. It’s not clear which behaviour should be considered more ‘natural’. What’s interesting and deserving of explanation is why, when it comes to behaviours such as risk-taking, violence or emotional expression, the sex difference is almost always in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then go on to draw links between my views and those of the ‘famously essentialist’ philosopher Aristotle, quoting &lt;a href="https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/1665-carole-hooven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; I said to Joe Rogan. Here I say that I’m trying to explain why we’re different &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;, and why we have &lt;em&gt;somewhat different natures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all this adds up to is that I don’t hold the essentialist views about sex that you ascribe to me. In order to understand why that’s the case, we should be on the same page about how you define such views. Here’s one example, from your book &lt;em&gt;Testosterone Rex &lt;/em&gt;(2017):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amid all the ‘noise’ of individual differences, a male or female ‘essence’ can be extracted: characteristics of maleness and femaleness that are natural, immutable, discrete, historically and cross-culturally invariant, and grounded in deep-seated, biological factors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear about my actual view of how biology and culture interact to produce sex differences, consider parental care. Men tend to do less overall, but the magnitude of the sex difference varies widely across cultures and historical periods. The existence and direction of the behavioural differences may be due to ‘deep-seated, biological factors’, but culture heavily influences how those differences &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;play out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say you’re not aiming at a straw man but rather the position you ascribe to me: that testosterone is an essence, that it underpins male nature, and that it makes men what they are. This would require accepting that every testosterone-typical man has the ‘male essence’, and so also the ‘male nature’, which presumably involves an aggressive predisposition. And that is simply not my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cordelia Fine’s conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;ot all species have evolved ‘traditional’ sex roles; environment and culture shape human behaviour; and not all men behave in stereotypically masculine ways. The fact that Carole and I agree on these things isn’t surprising. Understanding our disagreements requires digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this dialogue, Carole has denied that she thinks that testosterone ‘makes men what they are’. Yet in her recent TED talk, she stated that prenatal testosterone ‘made my son who he is today’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carole says that no ‘serious biologist’ thinks that maleness determines the predispositions of the male sex role. Yet in an opinion piece for &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; this February she wrote that: ‘Despite the vast natural variation among individuals, one constant stands out: sperm producers compete – often fiercely – for access to egg producers, while egg producers invest more in parenting …’ In this dialogue, what she calls ‘“sex-reversed” species’ are exceptions that prove the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carole says that testosterone ‘drives higher rates of aggressive competition in male mammals’ – including humans. As she puts it, sex differences ‘in traits like aggression (or anything else), originate in our differences in inherited biology’. Yet, according to her, this causally potent and ubiquitous hormonal force leaves only &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;men with a predisposition to aggression (setting aside whether or not it is expressed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Unlike any other mammal, we have evolved to socially construct gender roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; essentialism is no straw man, even if he is sometimes shy about showing himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex does indeed help us understand why, across species, some sex differences are more common than others. But the diversity of sex roles is an equally salient fact. This diversity reflects the many innovations evolution has found to help species reproduce – innovations that, in humans, include our capacities for cooperation, social learning and cultural transmission across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone and other hormones do help us adapt to conditions and contexts. But human exceptionalism goes well beyond ‘cultural norms [that] can modify how behavioural predispositions are expressed’, or self-reflectiveness about ‘our biological impulses’. Any scientific explanation of sex differences in behaviour must take seriously the idea that, unlike any other mammal, we have evolved to socially construct gender roles, as my most recent book [&lt;em&gt;Patriarchy Inc.: What We Get Wrong About Gender Equality and Why Men Still Win at Work&lt;/em&gt; (2025)] explores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider: why is male violence against women rare among Aka Pygmies? Why is same-sex adolescent fighting more than eight times more common in boys in some lower-income countries (such as Tunisia and Suriname) but equally common among boys and girls in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ab.21799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; (such as Tonga and Ghana)? Why do only &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S00127-013-0783-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S00127-013-0783-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;4 per&lt;/a&gt; cent of Swedish males follow a developmental trajectory leading to violent crime, while the remaining &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;96 per&lt;/span&gt; cent do not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of questions we should be asking if we are serious about addressing male violence. &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; will not help us find the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="subheading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carole Hooven’s conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat explains differences in male and female behaviour? The answer involves a complex mix of environmental and biological factors, including gender socialisation, genes and hormones. On this, Cordelia and I largely agree, and I’ve been grateful for the opportunity to discuss it all &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordelia opened this dialogue with a case study about men on an oil rig, illustrating the kind of evidence that’s made her ‘sceptical that [testosterone] is the root cause of the many gendered differences in behaviour that we see in humans.’ Such evidence, she claims, reveals that testosterone is ‘just … one of many factors that feeds into an animal’s decision-making,’ rather than being ‘the essence … of masculinity’. She says that I ‘take quite a different line’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Boys tend to play more roughly than girls, even though young children’s testosterone levels don’t differ much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t take a different line. Of course testosterone isn’t the male essence. And of course the hormone isn’t the only factor guiding behavioural decisions in humans or any other animals. Countless interacting factors – like health, marital status, local laws – affect our decisions, like whether to throw a punch in response to an insult. Yet across the diverse influences – physical, social and psychological – men are more likely to behave violently. Culture certainly plays a role here; but there is no denying that humans are far from the only animals in which males are more aggressive than females, and that testosterone is, at a minimum, strongly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763405000102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with those patterns. All of this, especially couched within the framework of sexual selection, implicates testosterone as a key player in human sex differences. Cordelia has offered no strong hypothesis that explains the fact that, across time and place, men are more likely than women to decide to throw that punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role does testosterone play, then? It acts on the male body and brain during critical developmental periods – in utero, around birth, and during puberty – with effects on behaviour that often show up down the road. Boys tend to play more roughly than girls, even though young children’s testosterone levels don’t differ very much. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014976342400085X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that higher testosterone in fetal males drives this preference, as it does in other mammals. &lt;a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Violent crime&lt;/a&gt;, which is overwhelmingly committed by men, doesn’t peak when testosterone &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960076019300743?casa_token=5X3gOkYMV5MAAAAA%3A-5cBTMSez6NnpZTKfDE1bR5JaNCfi3jEBGZLrVh709HSGrC2rwnyepAYPuMLbibDKlvYUYIDQQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;peaks&lt;/a&gt; in the late teens; instead, it peaks in men’s 20s, the phase of life when size, strength and competition for mates are at their highest. The existence of the paternal California mouse, as well as emotionally sensitive, high-testosterone human roughnecks, is entirely compatible with the hormone driving sex differences in aggression. An evolutionary perspective can help to make sense of these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as I believe, testosterone drives some important sex differences, this shouldn’t deter us from pursuing a safer, more just society. The solution lies in harnessing the power of culture, rather than altering our genes and hormones. An openness to the strongest evidence, and to learning all we can about how genes and environment interact to produce behaviour, can only help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing off &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; entirely serves only to shoot ourselves in the foot. Behavioural endocrinology and evolutionary theory provide powerful, time-tested frameworks for understanding sex differences in humans and other animals. Keep a sane &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/span&gt; alive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:00:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOVHIwNkU5VTI2VHpCSmFlY2ZaanZnX1VfTmdvVnNiYWZmeWVMaUs5VWM5YVNCSzMxZmJvQUZMTGJ0WmtmaE02RFg5aVN0a0YyZ1hZeUJScnNZTFhubFdqdnZvTlRJcUtzOFlYTUZqRldhcURSY04wRXhiZERja2tqcjZfTTgzT0w2VlBXTllONzNMQU5aSkE</guid></item><item><title>First case of measles reported in Indiana - WSBT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6wFBVV95cUxQOWxoQ0pLM0YwUE44Vktjc2pQSHU1V0w1VW9jSU9RRlVsbmhPelNVX080RDZYem5sUU8wRVNZWTVpMm92UE41WVJtMzdualFhQld1M09MNUJxMWpfbkhyeUNtcHlmUnEwN1pNck9EYjBva012QmZscE5TUkdjWGNJVjlNOVg2d1RnV01kLXNhU0ZoQVpvWGswUVVMR1hfMjFLSGx3R05kWVkwWC1aX0dYZ0xCc19tVWsxamZrbTJUUDVPa0g4MlV5UklWeHRkOTJwWkxHdzRJdFh6WURPR1B3RTM2azlKWnVlTEt3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind.

								&lt;p&gt;Reading mainstream media headlines over the weekend, one would think that Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/15/rfk-jrs-revenge-controversial-health-secretary-pick-is-payback-for/" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has finally learned his lesson on vaccines. After a second child died in Texas due to a measles outbreak, Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-distorted-vaccine-science1/" target="_blank"&gt;long-time opponent of the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in particular, posted a statement on X declaring, "The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine." This was enough to trigger a cascade of laudatory coverage of Kennedy for meeting the bare minimum of common sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;," declared Politico's headline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/06/kennedy-measles-vaccine-texas-visit" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy "advocated for the measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine during a visit to West Texas on Sunday," Axios reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"RFK Jr. after Texas visit: MMR vaccine 'most effective' way to prevent measles spread," &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/06/texas-measles-outbreak-second-death/82962586007/" target="_blank"&gt;blared the USA Today headline.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health secretary RFK Jr. endorses the MMR vaccine," &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" target="_blank"&gt;exclaimed the NPR headline, with the enticing promise&lt;/a&gt; that this is  "stoking fury among his supporters." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big, if true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Kennedy — or someone working for him — technically wrote those words down, those paying closer attention will notice that is not the message sent to the MAGA base by Kennedy's visit to Texas. If one looks past Kennedy's rote words to his actions, a much different picture emerges, and it becomes clear that he thinks vaccines are for weak, lazy parents. Superior parents, Kennedy suggests, toughen kids up by putting them through the measles instead. For one thing, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy spent most of his time in Texas celebrating parents &lt;/a&gt;who refuse to vaccinate, highlighting how many kids they have who didn't die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows efforts by Kennedy's anti-vaccine group, misnamed Children's Health Defense (CHD), to present parents of kids who die of measles as advocates for letting more kids die this way. After the first child died from this outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/" target="_blank"&gt;CHD released an ad featuring the parents of the dead girl &lt;/a&gt;explaining why they're happy with their choices, because they believe "she’s better off where she is now" and falsely claiming the disease made their surviving children stronger. (In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/7353/" target="_blank"&gt;measles weakens the bodies — and especially immune systems &lt;/a&gt;— of its victims.) Kennedy continued the message by arguing that the Mennonites who refuse vaccination are "resilient, hardworking, resourceful, and God-loving people," with the unsubtle implication that people who do vaccinate are less virtuous.&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-touts-bogus-measles-treatment-hours-after-burying-8-year-old-child/" target="_blank"&gt; Kennedy also spent the trip pushing &lt;/a&gt;"healers" as an alternative to prevention, even though the practitioners he cited use dangerous "treatments" that don't work — such as overdosing kids with vitamin A — but are instead &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/04/04/texas-vitamin-a-toxicity-measles-patients/82871895007/" target="_blank"&gt;sending kids to the hospital with liver damage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAGA audience understands that the pro-vaccine message is just what "they" are "forcing" Kennedy to say, and that his anti-vaccine gestures are his real message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this playbook sounds familiar, it should. Donald Trump, who appointed Kennedy to HHS, used the same two-faced strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the same purpose: to trigger headlines portraying him as a responsible steward of public health, while signaling to his followers that they should reject the advice of medical experts. For those who have memory-holed that traumatic period, a short recap: In official channels, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-live-trump-urges-social-distancing-warns-covid-19-could-disrupt-u-s-until-august" target="_blank"&gt;such as the White House briefing room&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/14/trump-urges-americans-to-wear-masks-361836" target="_blank"&gt;during interviews with respectable news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, Trump would playact a science-respecting leader, urging Americans to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks. But on social media and in his personal behavior, he &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/10/01/lets-tell-the-truth-about-the-pandemic-donald-trump-is-guilty-of-mass-murder/" target="_blank"&gt;would mock masks&lt;/a&gt;, tout fake "cures," celebrate people who refused to follow public health measures and throw indoor rallies and parties. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/10/19/fauci-absolutely-not-surprised-trump-got-covid-he-equates-wearing-a-mask-with-weakness/" target="_blank"&gt;When he inevitably contracted COVID-19 pre-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, he lied about how sick he was and dramatically flung off his mask on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump is a profoundly stupid man, but he is clever at being two-faced — a lifetime of practicing fraud will improve anyone's skills — so his strategy worked. The press dutifully reprinted his empty repetitions of the public health advice from experts. Meanwhile, the MAGA base heard his real opinion loud and clear. They dutifully followed his implied instructions to refuse all precautions. Even after he left office, the GOP base continued to show loyalty to Trump by risking sickness, usually by rejecting vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a sinister and probably accidental genius of this say-one-thing-do-another messaging strategy. Mainstream media, especially the kind that fancies itself "objective," prefer words over actions. What someone says can be quoted directly. A person's actions, however, can often have some plausible ambiguity that bad faith actors can exploit to muddy the waters. Kennedy's Texas trip is a good example. MAGA spinsters will read this article, for instance, and insist that I'm falsely interpreting the message of Kennedy's visit with the family, ignoring the fact that MAGA spinsters are in the mentions of that same post, praising his anti-vaccination message. But his empty pro-vaccine quote can be reprinted without getting into a quibble-fest with dishonest actors, making it a lot easier for journalists seeking that gold ring of "objectivity." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-faced strategy also provides the advantage of allowing the MAGA leader to paint himself as a brave truth-teller being suppressed by the mysterious but all-powerful "deep state" forces out to get him. The MAGA audience understands that the pro-vaccine message is just what "they" are "forcing" Kennedy to say, and that his anti-vaccine gestures are his real message. That gives the anti-vaccine message an allure of "forbidden" knowledge, making it even more powerful than if he just came right out and said what he really thinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's anti-vaccination actions aren't just about messaging, though that is bad enough. In his role at HHS, he's been waging war on decades of federal efforts to maintain and improve vaccination rates. Kennedy-aligned leaders at the Centers for Disease Control &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/28/the-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;suppressed a report showing vaccine refusals are behind&lt;/a&gt; the current measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/rfk-jr-gives-elon-musks-doge-free-rein-to-raid-the-health-agency/" target="_blank"&gt;Programs at the Food and Drug Administration to roll out&lt;/a&gt; new vaccines — including one to make COVID-19 vaccines less painful — were cut. And Kennedy has ordered a "study" into the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism to &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cdc-vaccine-autism-study-link-research-geier-rcna198485" target="_blank"&gt;be headed by a disgraced scientist who has peddled lies &lt;/a&gt;about vaccines for decades. Kennedy may not be able to take vaccines away entirely, but he can use his power to make them much harder to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's Texas trip is a terrible reminder of what a skilled propagandist he is. The message behind the trip was not "get vaccinated," no matter what the headlines say. It was about romanticizing vaccine refusal as courageous resistance against decadent, weak liberalism, which is about as fascist a framing as one can find. It was about normalizing children's deaths as necessary sacrifices for the MAGA cause. Whatever the mainstream media reports, the MAGA base gets Kennedy's message: don't vaccinate. &lt;/p&gt;

Everything seemed fine when she gave birth to her son, Treyson Wallace, on May 20, 2009, at Madison's Meriter Hospital. The entire pregnancy was complication-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But within hours of his birth, Treyson, now 15, failed the newborn hearing test. McGuire was asked to bring him back to redo the test for his two-week checkup. The results were the same. As he grew, so did his list of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He was not trying to make any words. He was not crawling," she said. "That's when the doctors started to think there was more going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors theorized Treyson could have &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cerebral-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353999" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angelman-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355621#:~:text=Children%20with%20Angelman%20syndrome%20often,side%20spinal%20curve%20over%20time." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Angelman syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a rare genetic syndrome that causes intellectual disabilities, difficulty walking and talking and seizures, many of the symptoms he possessed. Genetic testing was done. Nothing matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That changed in 2021 when the UW-Madison's Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine began the &lt;a href="https://chgpm.wisc.edu/uw-undiagnosed-genetic-disease-program/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Undiagnosed Disease Program&lt;/a&gt;, making it the second of its kind in the state. Part of the University's School of Medicine and Public Health, it is often the last stop for patients who are looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Treyson and his parents went to the clinic and met with pediatrician and clinical molecular geneticist, &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/staff/webb-md-bryn/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Bryn Webb&lt;/a&gt;, the program's director. A blood sample was taken from Treyson, and saliva samples were taken from his parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I didn't have high hopes," McGuire said. "Up until that point, none of the other tests were able to tell us anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Webb figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/07/PMJS/82976042007-web-bryn.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/07/PMJS/82976042007-web-bryn.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=676&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dr. Bryn Webb is the director of the Undiagnosed Disease Program in the UW-Madison's Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine, where she is also a professor.

His family had been treating his symptoms but were never able to put a name to exactly what they were treating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Webb reviewed his medical history, discussed his symptoms with his mother, then enrolled Treyson in the clinic’s genome sequencing study. With DNA samples from Treyson and his parents, Webb got to work searching on a super-computer for DNA sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Like most children referred to the clinic, Treyson had already had a typical DNA test that analyzes 1% of the body's DNA. In contrast, the UW's Undiagnosed Disease Program is able to analyze 3 billion base pairs, basically all the DNA in the body, Webb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When the initial DNA test is negative, or fails to provide an answer, that’s when they are more of a mystery, a puzzle," Webb said. "That’s when they come to our program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Webb said the Undiagnosed Disease Program has been fortunate to provide a diagnosis for roughly 35% of the patients enrolled in the program. In all, 60 patients have been analyzed since the clinic opened its door four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Finding answers is a labor- and time-intensive process. For roughly one year, Webb poured over data sets that log all known variations in the genome. Then one day, she identified a variant in the AGO1 gene. Something wasn't right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Genes are like the body’s instruction manual, guiding how proteins are made. Proteins carry out essential functions in our cells and are built from smaller units called amino acids. In Treyson's case, a mutation deleted a single amino acid in the AGO1 gene. This tiny change − just one building block removed − is responsible for his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Treyson is only the fourth person in the world whose Argonaut syndrome diagnosis can be attributed to this specific amino acid change, Webb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"There was an accident that occurred at the time of conception when the DNA was copying," Webb said.

She said she has a strong support system that includes nearby family and the same respite care provider for the past 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two weekends a month, the respite care worker comes to the house, giving McGuire time "to decompress," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As he gets older, so does she.

He is non-verbal, only saying a few words and largely communicating his needs by using a computer tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She has taught him everything he knows. He doesn't know it, but he has taught her a lot, too. He gives her hugs now, something he wasn't always able to do.

She shared eight signs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8 signs of you have vitamin D deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deepsikha posted the clip on Instagram and said that most people tend to neglect the signs of vitamin D deficiency, which could lead to several &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/too-busy-to-eat-healthy-nutrition-expert-shares-3-step-meal-prep-hack-based-on-dietary-guidelines-for-indians-101744038546826.html"&gt;health &lt;/a&gt;issues. She stressed that if you have any of the symptoms she mentioned in the clip, then it is best to take a blood test and then start with supplements after consulting a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are eight signs of vitamin D deficiency she shared:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Disturbed sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sign of vitamin D is that you don't sleep enough and end up twisting and turning here and there in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Feeling tired&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel tired and fatigued throughout the day, it could mean that you are vitamin D deficient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Poor mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the nutritionist, you could have depression and anxiety and also have a higher chance of having a low mood again if you have vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Loss of appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with vitamin D deficiency could have a loss of appetite. “You don't feel too hungry too often,” Deepshikha added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Hair loss and hair thinning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience hair thinning or even hair fall, you could have vitamin D deficiency and should definitely consult a doctor. Sixth, you have joint pain, knee pain, and even back pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6. Bone/back pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D-deficient people could end up having joint pain, knee pain and even back pain as well because of the lack of the vitamin in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Muscle fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are vitamin D deficient, there is muscle fatigue due to the low levels of the vitamin, Deepshikha explained in the Instagram reel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Pale and dry skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, having pale and dry skin could also be a sign of vitamin D deficiency, per the nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

He picked past bottles, chunks of fishing net, a toothbrush, a cup with a Pokemon character and a G.I. Joe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Yes!” he exclaimed, holding up a discarded pipette tip. “Found it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Garcia, a postdoctoral fellow in pharmaceutical sciences, discovered the pipette tip last summer with colleagues on a remote Hawaii beach. It was miraculously intact though it had most likely been degraded for years by sun, ozone and the ocean. How poignant, he thought. It was an object he and thousands of other scientists used every day. And there it was, washed up on a beach along with hundreds of pounds of other plastic waste they were now cleaning up and collecting for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Garcia is part of a leading lab, run by toxicologist Matthew Campen, that is studying how tiny particles known as microplastics accumulate in our bodies. The researchers’ &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;most recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in February in Nature Medicine, generated a string of alarmed headlines and buzz in the scientific community: They found that human brain samples from 2024 had nearly 50 percent more microplastics than brain samples from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This stuff is increasing in our world exponentially,” Dr. Campen said. As it piles up in the environment, it is piling up in us, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of the researchers’ other findings have also prompted widespread concern. In the study, the brains of people with dementia had far more microplastics than the brains of people without it. In papers last year, the researchers showed that microplastics were present in human &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-abstract/200/2/235/7673133?redirectedFrom=fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/81/7609801?login=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;placentas&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;Many of us turn to Sudoku, Wordle or brain-training apps to sharpen our minds. But research is increasingly showing one of the best ways to boost memory, focus and brain health is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reviewed data from more than 250,000 participants across 2,700 studies. We found exercise helps boost brain function – whether it’s walking, cycling, yoga, dancing, or even playing active video games such as Pokémon GO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving your body improves how we think, make decisions, remember things and stay focused – no matter your age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our review adds to a growing body of research that shows regular physical activity &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;improves&lt;/a&gt; three key areas of brain function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cognition, which is your overall ability to think clearly, learn and make decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;memory, especially short-term memory and the ability to remember personal experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;executive function, which includes focus, planning, problem-solving and managing emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review, which means we looked at the results of more than 130 high-quality research reviews that had already combined findings from many exercise studies. These studies usually involved people starting a new, structured exercise program, not just tracking the exercise they were already doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the effects on cognition, memory and executive function, the original studies used a range of brain function tests. These included things like remembering word lists, solving puzzles, or quickly switching between tasks – simple activities designed to reliably measure how well the brain is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvements were small to moderate. On average, exercise led to a noticeable boost in cognition, with slightly smaller but still meaningful gains in memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits showed up across all age groups, though children and teens saw major gains in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed greater improvements in executive function after physical activity than other population groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain started responding fairly quickly – many people experienced improvements after just 12 weeks of starting regular exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the greatest benefits were seen in those doing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week, aiming for a total of about 150 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Many people notice the difference after 12 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-people-doing-yoga-on-the-beach-T8kp53jUfaw"&gt;Isaac Takeu/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s happening in the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities such as walking or cycling can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;increase the size of the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who did aerobic exercise for a year grew their hippocampus by 2%, effectively reversing one to two years of age-related brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More intense workouts, such as running or high-intensity interval training, can further &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2017/8305287"&gt;boost neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; – the brain’s ability to adapt and rewire itself. This helps you learn more quickly, think more clearly and stay mentally sharp with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Another reason to get moving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s population is ageing. By 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health"&gt;one in six of people will be aged over 60&lt;/a&gt;. With that comes a rising risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many adults aren’t moving enough. One in three adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;aren’t meeting the recommended levels&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;should aim for&lt;/a&gt; at least 150 of moderate exercise – such as brisk walking – each week, or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous activity, like running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises, such as lifting weights, into workouts at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Adults need 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week, or 150 minutes of moderate exercise – plus two sessions of strength training.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-working-out-in-a-gym-dHHcDjMcN_I"&gt;Centre for Ageing Better/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Everyday movement counts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to run marathons or lift heavy weights to benefit. Our study showed lower-intensity activities such as yoga, tai chi and “exergames” (active video games) can be just as effective – sometimes even more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These activities engage both the brain and body. Tai chi, for instance, requires focus, coordination and memorising sequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exergames often include real-time decision-making and rapid response to cues. This trains attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these forms of movement are inclusive. They can be done at home, outdoors, or with friends, making them a great option for people of all fitness levels or those with limited mobility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you may already be doing a lot through daily life – like walking instead of driving or carrying shopping bags home – it’s still important to find time for structured exercise, such as lifting weights at the gym or doing a regular yoga class, to get the full benefits for your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real-life applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a grandparent, consider playing Wii Sports virtual tennis or bowling with your grandchild. If you’re a teenager with signs of ADHD, try a dance class, and see if it impacts your concentration in class. If you’re a busy parent, you might be more clear-headed if you can squeeze a 20-minute yoga video session between meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, you’re not just being active, you’re giving your brain a valuable tune-up. And unlike most brain-training apps or supplements, exercise delivers far reaching benefits, including improved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721002914?casa_token=pXaOJcQJ7d0AAAAA:0i4BjaxqJ21AQ2bGXI4DfQ6twKNybrg7c2f0_Xs7t-hWyDOH0SuKGTfruy-JlC_rMokUM3iWdlSQ"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplaces and schools are starting to take note. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2654"&gt;Short movement breaks&lt;/a&gt; are being introduced during the workday to improve employee focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools that incorporate &lt;a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0569-9"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; into the classroom are seeing improvements in students’ attention and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most powerful and accessible tools we have for supporting brain health. Best of all, it’s free, widely available and it’s never too late to start.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — A large new study adds to evidence that diabetes during pregnancy is linked with an increased risk of brain and nervous system problems in children, including autism, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether diabetes actually causes those problems remains unclear. But when mothers have diabetes while pregnant, children are 28% more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, according to an analysis of data pooled from 202 earlier studies involving more than 56 million mother-child pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks for children of mothers with diabetes during pregnancy were 25% higher for autism, 30% higher for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 32% higher for intellectual disability. They were also 20% higher for trouble with communication, 17% higher for movement problems and 16% higher for learning disorders than in children whose mothers did not have diabetes while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy appeared to confer a 39% higher risk for one or more of these neurodevelopmental disorders compared with gestational diabetes that begins in pregnancy and often resolves afterward, the researchers reported in The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes affects up to 9% of pregnancies in the United States, with the incidence rising, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of the earlier studies compared affected children with siblings. These analyses did not find an effect from mothers' diabetes, which suggests that shared genetic or familial factors might be contributing to the increased risk, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings emphasize the importance of medical support for women at risk of developing diabetes and the continuous monitoring of their children, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association of maternal diabetes with autism in offspring is well known, said Dr. Magdalena Janecka, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who studies links between in utero exposures and child development but was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large "meta-analysis" like this one allows for analyses of subgroups, such as mothers with preexisting versus gestational diabetes, or children with autism versus those with ADHD or movement disorders, but it cannot prove cause and effect, Janecka said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meta-analyses allow us to compare groups more precisely. At the same time, they are not bringing us any closer to understanding the causes or the underlying mechanisms," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One woman is sharing the ails of modern dating after seeing a message a man sent her on popular dating app Hinge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
        
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TikToker T Griff (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griff.t32"&gt;@griff.t32&lt;/a&gt;) posted a short clip detailing an interaction she had with a man on &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/hinge/"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; that went viral. In the video, which accumulated over 2.1 million views on the popular social media application, she says the man informed her he took a honey pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought the product was an athletic supplement. However, she soon learned that this wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No because the last time I was on Hinge talking to somebody,” Griff says. “He told me that he just took a honey pack. And I was like, ‘Oh cool, how many miles are you gonna run?’”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;She then pauses and looks into the camera with a blank expression. “I didn’t know what a honey pack was,” Griff says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-honey-pack"&gt;What is a honey pack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-a-honey-pack"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, honey packs are “falsely advertised” as supplements that promote sexual health. Since they aren’t FDA-approved, the outlet advises against consuming these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthline also reported that these items contain ingredients that aren’t included on their labeling. Consequently, the website states that individuals may suffer “serious health effects” should they consume them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Many of these unmentioned materials are often associated with prescription-only drugs. What differentiates over-the-counter medication from those mandated by doctors boils down to risk. For instance, prescription drugs may interfere with other medications. A healthcare professional would be able to assess these conflicts and prescribe appropriate pharmaceuticals accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics-and-health/pharmacogenomics/index.html"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; play a role in deciding which types of medicine a person can or can’t take. One such undisclosed ingredient found in honey packs is sildefanil, which is the active ingredient in Viagra. The popular Pfizer offering stimulates blood flow and was originally intended for those dealing with heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Viagra was found to induce erections in men and is prescribed to treat those with erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypotension is one such adverse side effect of taking the aforementioned chemical. It can lead to dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, fatigue, and confusion, as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21156-low-blood-pressure-hypotension"&gt;per the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Some have reported other adverse symptoms upon consuming honey packs. Chief among them are allergic reactions, vomiting, anaphylaxis, rash breakouts, uncontrolled sweating, hives, itchy skin, and abnormal swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-a-honey-pack#what-they-are"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; writes that many unregulated manufacturers often add other ingredients to honey. Some may include ginseng, bee pollen, and royal jelly. While there are some packs that purely contain natural ingredients, the outlet advises against purchasing those that promise sexual enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@griff.t32/video/7482435799850503455" data-video-id="7482435799850503455"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hinge-horndogs"&gt;Hinge horndogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous folks who responded to Griff’s video were baffled by the man’s decision to share this information with her. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;One was shocked that a man revealed he needed a honey pack to maintain an erection. “The fact that these men are needing these honey packs is embarrassing for them,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another couldn’t believe someone would use one of these over-the-counter sexual enhancement products to use a dating application. “Imagine taking a honey pack to then just scroll through Hinge,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Griff appeared bemused by her response to the man’s honey pack admission, one user thought her reply was appropriate. “No that was the perfect answer to a stranger on Hinge saying that,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone else wondered why there seems to be an uptick in the demand for sexual enhancement items. “I’m curious why so many young men need things like that,” they questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Another woman said that hearing an admission of honey pack usage is a massive turn off. “Okay but why are they so excited to tell us?? Like bro? You’re 40. I’m gonna need a honey pack because of how dry that statement makes me,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Dot has reached out to Griff via TikTok comment for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Samples have been used to estimate both the amount and type of viruses shed by the region’s 3.3 million residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started with coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic expanded to include MPOX in 2022 and research efforts are underway on using the same genetic analysis techniques to detect influenza, hepatitis and measles and other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9274835" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SUT-L-wastewater-testing.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="..At UC San Diego campus on Friday, Dec. 3, 2021 in San Diego, CA., postdoctoral researcher, Smruthi Karthikeyan gathers a waste sample from one of the 131 auto samplers on campus that monitor 350 campus buildings.

(Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those efforts ground to a halt Monday after researchers received word that the roughly $400,000 per year provided by the county’s public health department would cease, a casualty of an initiative from the Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts to a national “Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity” program run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While other wastewater testing services will still be available, San Diego County’s effort provided more information on the types of viruses circulating in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Louise Laurent, a perinatal research director at UC San Diego, and Kristian Andersen, director of infectious disease genomics at Scripps Research, said Monday that the funding pullback forces SEARCH to stop operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to do one more batch, because we already purchased the reagents,” Laurent said, noting that the lab’s weekly delivery of new samples is now finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurent said that there was an expectation that funding would run out, as the county planned to add wastewater surveillance to its list of ongoing operations, including the special equipment necessary for the operation in its $93 million new public health laboratory in Kearny Mesa that is expected to open in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that they anticipated a gradual transfer of knowledge from the research labs that have been running this highly technical service for years to those at the county who will be responsible for delivering accurate results going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plan was that we would finish out this year’s contract at the end of August and then there would be an orderly transition where they were going to come back and learn our process from start to finish,” Laurent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that the key would have been to have both UCSD and the county lab processing the same wastewater samples on each organization’s equipment in parallel in order to make sure that results matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of the issue is that this is disorderly,” Laurent said. “Finding out, you know, on a given day that your contract ended a week ago and that there is no transition time and that you are just expected to stop, that’s not the most efficient way to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In an ideal situation, the county lab would have started its in-house program while UCSD was still running in order to create an equivalence between the county data and UCSD’s,” an emailed statement said. “The lab can still stand up a fully functional program in-house without this, but it might be harder to compare data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health services, the county statement added, is “working on the logistics of transferring historical samples from UCSD to the new county lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say, Andersen added, that research agencies plan to just walk away from the county’s effort, though without grant funds, there are limits to what can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not angry with the county because we know that they don’t want to do this,” Andersen said. “Even without any funds we will continue to help as much as we can in terms of getting the county set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But, to be clear, all of this is because of mandates that come right from the federal government, and specifically those cutting all the funding, not the county itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the situation, the county said in a statement that the existing wastewater testing contract “was paused in light of the federal cuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The county continues to anticipate moving that testing, and related investigation procedures, to the new lab,” the statement said. “In addition, Wastewater SCAN and CDPH (California Department of Public Health) both provide local testing. Public Health Services is grateful for the services UC San Diego and Scripps have provided for this contract and looks forward to continuing a close relationship going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county referenced Wastewater SCAN, a nationwide wastewater analysis project jointly run with philanthropic funds by Stanford University and Emory University in Atlanta. The project lists no indications that it too will shut down. And the California Department of Public Health also regularly publishes wastewater readings for coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s different about San Diego’s SEARCH project is the level of detail made available to the community. Other projects provide regular updates on the total amount of viral genetic material found in wastewater samples, a critical factor in early detection of new outbreaks building in the community. Spikes in the overall number of viruses detected generally correlate with the arrival of a new variant capable of spreading rapidly and quickly causing many new infections. SEARCH goes one step further, using genetic sequencing to determine which subtypes of the virus are causing increases in overall activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is critical to understand because not all variants behave the same, and we need to know which ones are circulating in order to select new variants for future vaccines and, importantly, now which variants could evade the monoclonal antibodies used for treatments and prophylaxis of those who can’t take the vaccine or can’t generate their own immunity,” Andersen said.&lt;/p&gt;
