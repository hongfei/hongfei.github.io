&lt;h2&gt;So if you’ve been anxious about not getting enough protein, worry not! You probably are, but if you want an extra boost, reach for whole foods — and maybe skip processed meats as a regular part of your diet.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;We also chatted with Dunn about why we’re wasting our time and money if we’re getting too much protein, which nutrient we should probably be focusing on instead of protein, and much more.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more from Elizabeth Dunn, &lt;a href="https://www.elizabethgdunn.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;visit her website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://substack.com/@lizdunn183" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;subscribe to her Substack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/protein-rich-snack-meat-sticks-carcinogen_l_6961173ee4b0120ab25d18a4" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010383"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;In 2024, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/complete-map-fruit-fly-brain-circuitry-unveiled" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;completed the first-ever map&lt;/a&gt; of the circuitry of a fruit fly’s brain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Despite its diminutive size, the organ packs almost 500 feet of wiring and 54.5 million synapses into the size of a grain of sand — an astonishing feat of computational neurology research that allows scientists to better understand how signals travel throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;And thanks to significant advances of some of the world’s most capable supercomputers, researchers at the Jülich Research Centre in Germany are now aiming their sights at a far more ambitious goal: a simulation at the scale of the entire human brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Previous attempts, dating back a decade, like the Human Brain Project, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/simulate-human-brain-fell-flat"&gt;fell largely flat&lt;/a&gt;, despite considerable government funding. But as &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2510892-were-about-to-simulate-a-human-brain-on-a-supercomputer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the Jülich researchers think they can push things forward. The idea is to bring together several models of smaller regions of the brain with a supercomputer to run simulations of billions of firing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The team, which is being led by Jülich neurophysics professor Markus Diesmann, will leverage the Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research (JUPITER) supercomputer for their simulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;JUPITER is currently the fourth most powerful supercomputer in the world &lt;a href="https://top500.org/lists/top500/2025/11/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to the TOP500 list&lt;/a&gt;, and features thousands of graphical processing units.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The team demonstrated last month that a “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09502" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;spiking neural network&lt;/a&gt;” could be scaled up and run on JUPITER, effectively matching the cerebral cortex’s 20 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Once up and running, the simulation could be a major upgrade, Diesmann told &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, compared to previous, much smaller simulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We know now that large networks can do qualitatively different things than small ones,” he said. “It’s clear the large networks are different.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;At the end of the day, we’re still only scratching the surface of an organ that &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/communications-that-matter/202307/new-studies-prove-the-brain-is-still-a-mystery" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;remains mysterious&lt;/a&gt; to scientists. Even simulations at the scale of a human brain will only teach us so much about how it functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We can’t actually build brains,” University of Sussex mathematical physics professor Thomas Nowotny told &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. “Even if we can make simulations of the size of a brain, we can’t make simulations of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone, it seemed, was scrambling to load up on the humble macro. Influencers gleefully showed off their &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sohonutrition/video/7594540935577439495"&gt;high-protein diets&lt;/a&gt;, complete with eggs, cottage cheese, poultry and red meat. Many also touted their high-protein snacks, which ranged from slices of cold cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livcarbonero/video/7531124775947652365"&gt;homemade chicken chips&lt;/a&gt; made from seasoned, ground meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major food companies were even hellbent on following the bandwagon. Protein was added to classic buttermilk pancakes, &lt;a href="https://www.ihop.com/en/menu/world-famous-buttermilk-pancakes/protein-power-pancakes"&gt;courtesy of IHOP&lt;/a&gt;. Protein was sprinkled onto popcorn, thanks to &lt;a href="https://khloudfoods.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoom0b7mKSSXf49H6zo3brMA_FxsIZskw9nl1Rmv-sw03zkdMWFj"&gt;Khloud by Khloé Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;. And protein was steeped in our favorite beverages, thanks to both &lt;a href="https://protein.starbucks.com/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ProteinLP&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23056097230&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADoJV5tYxOR0Grzcgnxxximib642V&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAvaLLBhBFEiwAYCNTfyzUnCyibr5DiIMF28dZfuJNf66l1jsmqMVnatMrrJc6OSpcV3BlhBoCKTsQAvD_BwE"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/dunkin-protein-milk-2026"&gt;Dunkin’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein’s sheer prevalence prevails in the new year, especially in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2026/01/07/kennedy-rollins-unveil-historic-reset-us-nutrition-policy-put-real-food-back-center-health"&gt;new dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that place red meat at the very top of the food pyramid. But it’s slated to face some competition from yet another macronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That’s according to Oatly’s first-ever &lt;a href="https://www.oatly.com/en-us/things-we-do/initiatives/future-of-taste"&gt;Future of Taste report&lt;/a&gt;, which predicts that fiber is coming for protein’s crown within the coffee scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After first emerging on TikTok in Autumn 2024, ‘fibremaxxing’ (or fibERmaxxing) suddenly spiked this summer, sending the world’s media into a chia-induced frenzy. Pageviews for articles mentioning the term jumped 9500% between June to July,” states the report, which features insights from over 200 expert interviews, baristas and partners at &lt;a href="https://culturelab.co/"&gt;CultureLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, fiber has been enjoying a moment recently. Last March, The New York Times published the article, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/style/prebiotic-gut-soda.html"&gt;“Why Are We Living in the Golden Age of ‘Gut Soda’?”&lt;/a&gt; pointing to the rising popularity of prebiotic sodas like Olipop and Poppi. According to &lt;a href="https://www.arizton.com/about"&gt;Artizon&lt;/a&gt;, a market research platform, the global prebiotics market is set to increase from $6.95 billion in 2023 to $13.26 billion by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Big macro-level shifts tend to be reactive,” Oatly’s report states. “If the ‘20s have so far belonged to protein, itself a reaction to the vegan-mania of the ‘10s, we’d expect to see a digestion-conscious movement coming down the line in response. Cue [fiber’s] walk-on music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, fiber’s takeover of the coffee space raises several questions. What does that actually look like? How much is too much? And what are the nutrition benefits — and, possible, detriments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with a few coffee experts to dissect what “fibermaxxing” our coffee entails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is fibermaxxing, explained in simple terms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like its name suggests, fibermaxxing is an ongoing, social media-centric trend of maximizing dietary fiber intake by consuming fiber-rich foods like fruits, veggies, legumes, seeds, nuts, whole grains and supplements (psyllium, methylcellulose, or polycarbophil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this trend is the meeting point of a couple different trends that were existing already, one being gut health,” explains Cara Harbstreet, M.S., R.D., L.D., Oatly’s Director of Nutrition. “A lot of folks have taken a big interest in overall health and wellness and just how they feel day to day. Linking that to gut health was an obvious next step. So, we’ve seen that growing interest there with probiotics and prebiotics and more of the supplement space. But now, that has trickled into other foods and just a growing awareness of the role of fiber for health and well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current dietary guidelines say that most people should consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories in their daily diet. That’s approximately 25 to 28 grams of fiber per day for women and 28 to 34 grams per day for men. However, many U.S. adults aren’t meeting those requirements. The American Society for Nutrition reported in 2021 that only five percent of men and nine percent of women were eating the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber. Additionally, colorectal cancer (CRC) rates have been on the rise in young adults. The American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that “one in five people diagnosed with CRC are now under the age of 55.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence why fiber intake has become such a newfound craze. Harbstreet says fibermaxxing is an “evolution” of the protein-maxxing trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is where I think there’s still a lot of confusion with fiber,” she adds. “As we’ve seen with protein, a lot of folks tend to adopt the thinking that if a little bit of something is good for me, then more must be better. And, therefore, the maxxing component comes into play, where all of a sudden this interest kind of overtakes other aspects of a balanced diet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insoluble vs. soluble fibers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like to think of soluble fiber as a sponge,” Harbstreet says. “That’s an easy way to remember that it’s going to draw in that liquid. It’s going to expand and add bulk as it travels through the GI system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continues, “Insoluble fiber is a little bit different. It’s more like a broom, where it’s going to come through and sweep things along, kind of help clear things out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither type of fiber is better than the other, but they are different functionally, Harbstreet underscores. Soluble fibers tend to add thickness and a creamy component, which is preferable when making a latte. Insoluble fibers, since they lack that absorptive effect, may cause separation when added to a cup of coffee or settle at the bottom of the mug. From a palatability standpoint, soluble fibers are more favorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that fiber is showing up in in current conversations around changes to the dietary guidelines,” Harbstreet says. “That distinction is important when you think about fiber in the big picture — and understanding that both types have a role to play and which food sources, or in this case, beverages, can provide those.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does fiber in coffee look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that brewed coffee already contains soluble dietary fiber. An eight-ounce cup of coffee could contain nearly 1.5 grams of fiber, while 3.2 cups could have nearly five grams, according to &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/need-fiber-have-some-coff/"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;. However, drinking coffee alone isn’t enough to meet the minimum daily dietary fiber requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making a fiber-rich cup of joe, plant-based milks are a great addition, says Nethra Rajendran, Beverage Experience Developer, Oatly North America. “Oat milk has a great neutral flavor and naturally-occurring fiber,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another easy incorporation is chia seeds. “They add a great texture that is sippable and can be used in pudding form,” Rajendran says. For an indulgent breakfast option, she suggests making a tiramisu chia seed pudding with freshly-brewed espresso, oat milk, chia seeds, granola crumbles and a cacao dusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even add a tablespoon or two of chia seeds to your favorite latte recipes and let them sit for 30 minutes before adding ice. “When they are ready, I like to think of them as mini-fiber-bobas when I slurp them through a straw,” Rajendran says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeds and pitted fruits can also be added in the form of pastes, purees and syrups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ingredients like dates and figs can really shine in drinks for natural sweetness and minerals,” Rajendran explains. “They are little fiber bombs and great prebiotics, as well as a source of unrefined sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black sesame is also having a moment, she continues. “I love a black sesame latte with homemade black sesame paste that I throw in the food processor and then add that paste to oat milk with a shot of espresso. Not only are black sesame seeds high in fiber, but they are an excellent source of iron and are used as a hair growth super food in Asian cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some unconventional ways to “fiber-fy” your coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You would be surprised by how many ingredients you can turn into a syrup, puree, paste or concentrate,” Rajendran says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes corn tortillas, which can be infused alongside agave into your plant-based milk of choice, and sweet corn, which is Rajendran’s personal favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can achieve a gorgeous slightly umami and sweet flavor by blending steamed or canned sweet corn kernels with oat milk and straining it,” she explains. “Some people like to keep in a little pulp for extra texture and fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t big on crafting their own syrups or infusions, Rajendran recommends experimenting with fermented, umami flavors made from fiber-containing foods, like miso, tahini and gochujang, and adding them to your lattes for a hint of savory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a sweet alternative, Rajendran points to Tepache, a traditional Mexican beverage made by fermenting pineapple peels and core with piloncillo (or brown sugar) and other spices (like cinnamon) in water for a few days at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The result is a tangy, and fizzy drink,” she continues. “We are seeing people get creative with the Tepache coffee fusion — either adding finished Tepache to cold brew or adding coffee beans in the initial fermentation process with the pineapple rinds. We find that adding some oat milk balances the high acid profiles from both the coffee and Tepache and adds a creamier, rounded taste.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much fiber is too much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the old adage goes, too much of a good thing can be bad, which applies to fiber intake too. The main concern is people not getting enough fiber. But on the flip side, exceeding the recommended amounts of daily dietary fiber can cause several unpleasant GI symptoms, like bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition to thinking about proteins spread evenly throughout the day, include fiber with that too,” Harbstreet says. “Loading it up in one large dose at a time likely does contribute to some of those GI symptoms that that can make us feel uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harbstreet also recommends pairing your fiber coffee with a complete meal, especially if you’re planning on drinking it early in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Something as simple as pairing it with a serving of fruit, getting protein from another whole grain or high fiber food source,” she says. “This is an additive approach. We’re not looking to replace things that you’re already including in your diet. We’re looking to add something that carries that benefit through even more strongly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many people are indulging in coffee later in the day, as a way to have mindful moment or take a break from work, Harbstreet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see fiber and coffee also playing really well in that space,” she adds. “You’re sort of mentally and emotionally fulfilled by that break. But also, you walk away from it feeling like, ‘Hey, I’m not actually feeling hungry still.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A deluge of research has painted a picture of our world being drowned in tiny, inescapable microplastics. Our guilt over plastic particles being found in even the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/microplastics-sediment-layers"&gt;most remote regions&lt;/a&gt; on Earth turned into paranoia once scientists started discovering them in our own bodies, too — riddling our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;blood streams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/01/microplastics-in-body-polluted-tiny-plastic-fragments.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;organs&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study"&gt;our brains&lt;/a&gt;, stoking a rush of scientific inquest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But now, there’s a growing contingent in the scientific community that’s casting significant doubts on these claims, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, criticizing the methodologies used in some of the most notable papers behind them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine &lt;/em&gt;last February claimed to have documented a rise in micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) in human brain tissues by autopsying preserved cadavers of people who had died between 1997 and 2024. But in November, another group of researchers contested the findings in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04045-3.epdf?sharing_token=Swtp3rys_E2BRMy_4UzjxNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PS5QtSs_irU94U55JE4Ar4Z5UOMBpR3_t_yCh0UzMgGKL-GztU5e15cffbRpDb67AMozIXlp82gM9YW2QGk63C5OxsW_ncVxqYJfdR7JAeVCZI4Lm6SNe2MQ8ERqGifs1OgQsP5qE_G-FoRGaatnnKUVXs-mVt2rnDNZCH-KhkeAl8JJ6iMM5a0HkEMmh7iEykGmqbwM7HNfyR0WQXdXyZG_lEJi-kldTxX-9AEdPLcphyK-h1_XS0ZkOypNJl5Nc%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; published in the same journal, criticizing them for “limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps,” per &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The brain microplastic paper is a joke,” coauthor of the letter Dušan Materić, from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, told the newspaper. “Fat is known to make false-positives for polyethylene. The brain has [approximately] 60 percent fat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In reality, Materić suggests that rising obesity rates could explain the trend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“That paper is really bad, and it is very explainable why it is wrong,” he added, warning that there’s serious doubts over “more than half of the very high impact papers” over microplastics in tissues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;One core issue arises from the prevailing method for measuring the mass of micro and nanoplastics. Called Py-GC-MS, it involves pyrolyzing the sample, or heating it in an oxygen free environment until it vaporizes. The fumes this process produces are then separated and measured so the nature of the original substance can be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But as it turns out, the same fume signatures for the materials used in microplastics like polyethylene can also be produced from the fats present in human tissue. And while studies purport to chemically remove the tissues before subjecting the samples to pyrolysis, critics are skeptical that some traces aren’t being left over and producing false positives. This led University of Queensland environmental chemist Cassandra Rauert to conclude in a January 2025 &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c12599" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that Py-GC-MS “is not currently a suitable technique for identifying polyethylene or PVC due to persistent interferences.” In all, the paper points to 18 studies that didn’t properly account for the risk of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I do think it is a problem in the entire field,” Rauert added to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “I think a lot of the concentrations [of MNPs] that are being reported are completely unrealistic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Another problem is that while the field of analytical chemistry has guidelines on how to analyze certain samples, these guidelines don’t exist yet for microplastics, according to Frederic Béen at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“But we still see quite a lot of papers where very standard good laboratory practices that should be followed have not necessarily been followed,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, such as measures for removing background contamination. “So you cannot be assured that whatever you have found is not fully or partially derived from some of these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The debate underscores how nascent the field of exploring the environmental and health impact of microplastics is, meaning it will take many more years of patient science before the dust is settled. At present, experts aren’t sure how microplastics affect our health, nor have they definitely proven that they’re harmful to us (though there are &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/microplastics-degrading-bones"&gt;no shortage of studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-mental-health"&gt;suggesting they do&lt;/a&gt;). Still, no one can be blamed for being unsettled by the idea of having a plastic spoon’s worth of the stuff in their noggin, but if the skeptics are believed, maybe that claim is up for review, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We do have plastics in us — I think that is safe to assume,” Materić said. “But real hard proof on how much is yet to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

You recently wrote that testosterone does not increase the risk for heart attacks. But you overlooked the real risk of testosterone therapy: cancer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RVLUGOAY7BAMJFLS2HHBKTFF3A"&gt;I survived advanced prostate cancer seven years ago by having my testes removed because prostate cancer needs testosterone to grow. Most men with prostate cancer get leuprolide injections for several months to suppress testosterone production while they wait for radiation or surgery. They get off it as quickly as possible though, because men would rather die than give up sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JFYCFN5YNRHCPNAHZG5PLM3IH4"&gt;A. For decades, physicians believed that elevated testosterone levels increased the risk for prostate cancer and heart disease. A large clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine (July 13, 2023) contradicted that conviction. It concluded that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) did not contribute to cardiovascular events. The same study also determined that men with low PSA levels were no more likely to develop prostate cancer on TRT than on placebo (JAMA Network Open, Dec. 1, 2023). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQ2RQWBV2NEFLEMF4MJPUI5KOA"&gt;As you note, prostate cancer is frequently treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

    &lt;p&gt;For Lacy Cornelius Boyd, March 19, 2024, was an exciting day. She and her husband had taken their 6-year-old daughter to the Grand Canyon as part of a family road trip. Boyd, her husband and their daughter were planning to stop at McDonald's before heading home to Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was well — until their car hit a patch of black ice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were spinning. My husband obviously lost control, and he hit another car head-on," Boyd recalled. Everything else was a blur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd's daughter had a broken arm. Her husband and the other driver were fine. Boyd had broken bones in her neck and ribs, a collapsed lung, and severe injuries to her intestines. She had six surgeries in five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the damage to her intestines — caused by a too-tight seatbelt — kept getting worse, Boyd said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were trying to save my intestines, and every time they would go back in, they were just dying from no blood flow," Boyd said. "I was told that most people have 35 feet of small intestine. I was left with about 35 inches." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"Just going through the motions"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd was discharged from the hospital after a month. She was diagnosed with short bowel syndrome and had an ileostomy bag attached to her side to collect waste. Her remaining intestines couldn't process the nutrients from food, so she needed 12 hours of IV nutrition a day. She said her daughter was afraid of the tubes, wires and medical machines that now filled their home. Boyd was always weak and dehydrated, and never wanted to leave the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I went out to eat somewhere, I'd be in the bathroom immediately, or I'd have to go to the bathroom five times at a restaurant, so it was just embarrassing," Boyd said. "I felt like everyone was enjoying their life and I was just going through the motions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Boyd, who had previously worked in healthcare, regularly met with doctors to see if her quality of life could be improved. No one had answers. Finally, she followed up on an unlikely lead. During her hospitalization, a surgeon had told Boyd's sister she should contact the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd self-referred herself to the hospital system in November 2024. She met with general surgeon Dr. Masato Fujiki and after an evaluation, he suggested something she'd never heard of before: An intestinal transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started crying. I think he thought I was sad, but I was really happy," Boyd said. "Everyone had told me that was going to be my life." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A rare, risky transplant &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplants are a rare procedure, said Dr. Adam Griesemer, a transplant surgeon at NYU Langone. Only about 100 are done in the U.S. every year, compared to the 25,000 kidney transplants done annually, said Fujiki, the director of Cleveland Clinic's Intestinal Transplant Program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplants have the worst outcomes of any type of transplant, Griesemer said, so there is a "high threshold" for doctors to consider them. They are generally only recommended for children born with intestinal defects and people who will be dependent on IV nutrition for the rest of their lives, like Boyd, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplant patients "really struggle with rejection and infections," Griesemer said. Intestines harbor bacteria inside them, so during cases of organ rejection, the barrier preventing the bacteria from entering the bloodstream breaks down. Fujiki said rejection rates have been improving over the past decade, estimating that it has decreased from 40% of cases to about 8%. Medication can help reduce infections, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 50% of patients survive more than five years after receiving the transplant, Griesemer said. In comparison, kidney transplants have a 98% five-year survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Prepared for the worst"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd began the process of getting listed for an intestinal transplant in November. In July 2025, 16 months after the car crash, Boyd received the transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. The day of the operation was filled with emotion, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was excited. I was nervous. I was sad about leaving my daughter, and I felt for the donor's family," Boyd said. "But really, I was prepared for the worst." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation took about 12 hours, Fujiki said. Everything went smoothly. But it was just the first step in a long process: Boyd spent the next three weeks recovering in the hospital, followed by three months of outpatient recovery in Cleveland so she could stay near her care team for close monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd had no complications in her recovery, Fujiki said. Her ostomy bag was removed. She no longer needed IV nutrition. The weekend before Thanksgiving, she returned to Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was amazing to be able to come home," Boyd said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A festive return home &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd arrived home just in time for beloved holiday traditions. After missing other milestones, like her daughter's first day of school and Halloween, Boyd was relieved to be a part of the celebrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My daughter is six now, but my husband carries her to the Christmas tree every morning to get her presents. I don't know how much longer she's going to let him do that," Boyd said. "I was like, 'This year might be the last time, and I'll miss it.' But I didn't." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd remains on a regimen of anti-rejection medications and will continue to receive follow-up care at the Cleveland Clinic. Otherwise, normalcy reigns, and it feels like the last of the trauma from the crash has been repaired, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's nice to take my daughter to school, pick her up, not have to worry about anything, to take her and to be able to go out to eat. I couldn't drink Coke before. I couldn't do normal things for like, a year and a half," Boyd said. "It's so much. Everyone is just a little bit more at peace." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Everything had been leading to the meeting early last year in Zanzibar, a tropical archipelago off the east coast of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A hundred researchers, clinicians and other experts on HIV from across Africa and beyond were there to discuss big plans — the development of an innovative vaccine on the continent that could prevent the disease, which continues to infect and kill people disproportionately in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And they had big money to do it. This group, called the &lt;a href="https://africanalliance.org.za/brilliant-consortium-shut-down-home-page/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BRILLIANT Consortium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had landed a $45 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I mean, it's unprecedented," says &lt;a href="https://www.nicd.ac.za/communicable-diseases-researcher-directory/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nonhlanhla Mkhize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical scientist with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, "having a consortium that is made up of African scientists working toward an African problem in our labs here in Africa."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106085" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Nonhlanhla Mkhize, a medical scientist with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, called the HIV vaccine initiative once funded by USAID "unprecedented — having a consortium that is made up of African scientists working toward an African problem in our labs here in Africa."

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Year one of the five-year grant had been almost entirely virtual. Now, they were all here together in Zanzibar and ready to turn their expertise into action. All the presentations and discussions and arguments had coalesced around a solid plan to thwart the virus. The scientific advisory board endorsed the imminent launch of the vaccine trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I remember the excitement was through the roof," says Mkhize. "We were at the beginning of something big."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But just as the meeting was about to wrap up, the mood darkened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new executive order signed by President Trump on the day of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 2025, had frozen all foreign aid pending a review. Soon, DOGE would begin its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-75222/usaid-trump-humanitarian-rubio-musk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decimation of USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — cutting programs, interrupting funding streams, letting people go, and generally sowing uncertainty within an agency that, for more than six decades, had provided global humanitarian aid and development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disruptions were starting to ricochet around the world, including at that gathering in Zanzibar.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I remember at the end of the meeting, a USAID colleague saying to me, 'I'm not sure if I'll see you again,'" says &lt;a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/research/extramural-research-units/antibody-immunity" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Penny Moore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. "I completely underestimated how much it would gut the program."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, the official stop work orders were issued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was crushing because we were about to enroll our first participants within the trial," says Moore. "It takes months and months and months to gear up for a clinical trial. [But] you can shut it down almost immediately."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106088" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Once the USAID grant was canceled, there was a lot of unease. "I don't think any of us knew what was going to happen," says Dale Kitchin, a senior scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "There was generally a sense of alarm."

"There was generally a sense of alarm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This story might have ended here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In many ways, we've kind of had our legs cut off even as we're beginning to run the sprint," says &lt;a href="https://desmondtutuhealthfoundation.org.za/team-members/linda-gail-bekker/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Linda-Gail Bekker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation at the University of Cape Town, one of the collaborating partners under the USAID grant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the team steeled their resolve. They knew the science was sound and the need was urgent. They insisted on finding a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106080" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                The scientists found new sources of funding to support a pared-down version of the HIV vaccine trial — none of it from the U.S. government. "I'm afraid we will have to do it with or without because this matters too much to not finish the work," says Linda-Gail Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no sugar-coating the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was all happening, according to Moore, at a critical time in the fight against HIV. She doesn't believe that treatments alone — including the recent introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/11/18/g-s1-98178/hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a twice-yearly injectable — will be enough. "We need to get to the point where we are finally ahead of the virus, and I think that the only way we can do that is through a vaccine," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moore has been studying HIV for over 20 years, slowly piecing together a detailed portrait of the virus. Research on HIV by her and others has also taught scientists about how the human immune system functions more generally, which has facilitated advances against other ailments including COVID-19, RSV and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A good portion of Moore's work has been supported by the U.S. In her lab in Johannesburg, pieces of equipment, including refrigerators and centrifuges purchased with funds from USAID, have stickers from the agency plastered on them. Some contain the phrase: "from the American people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106090" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Some items, such as this flow cytometer used to isolate cells,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contain the phrase: "from the American people." The reason, says Penny Moore, a virologist at the University of Witwatersrand, is "so that we remember who bought them for us."

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The reason, says Moore, is "so that we remember who bought them for us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the equipment, Moore's research has relied on a group of 117 South African women who have contributed their blood regularly to her lab for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The people who are donating these samples live in the communities most ravaged by HIV," she says. "And they donate because they hope to see an end to an epidemic that is really real for them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 20 years of samples are stored in a room arrayed with half a dozen large freezers. This is, essentially, Moore's career on ice. She cracks open the lid of one and pulls out a stack of frozen tubes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106089" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"This is blood and cells and DNA," she says. "It's heavy and hard for me to lift. The amount we have learned from these freezers, it's just astonishing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings include answering questions that helped lead to the vaccine that Moore and her team were about to start testing under the USAID grant, like — why is HIV so skilled at evading our bodies' defenses?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like an M&amp;amp;M, in that it's completely covered by sugars," Moore explains. "And sugars are essentially invisible to the immune system. So it's very difficult for the immune system to see the virus at all." While other viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, deploy these sugary shields to a lesser extent, Moore says HIV is the most accomplished when it comes to hiding within and from the human body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, HIV is remarkably variable. The virus mutates frequently, making "every mistake it can every single day," says Moore. But not all mistakes are bad. "Very quickly, every mistake that survives turns into a swarm of viruses within one person, and they're all different from one another."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This allows the virus to evolve in different directions in different places, including within Africa. "The virus that they have in Kenya is not the same as the virus that we have in Botswana," she says. "It's not the same as the virus that they have in Senegal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This diversity was a big reason why Moore was so excited to be working with colleagues from different African countries under the USAID grant. It would have allowed the testing of vaccine candidates on a range of flavors of the virus in different populations on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for the vaccine itself, its origins began with a key insight that came out of Moore's lab, in part. A few years after becoming infected with HIV, a small fraction of the people donating blood developed something called broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are "the kinds of antibodies that can recognize and neutralize a virus regardless of where that virus comes from," says Moore. "And in many cases, up to 90% of global viruses could be stopped by one antibody."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Broadly neutralizing antibodies are weird looking. "They're all freaks of nature," allows Moore. Some have really long arms. Some have super short arms. Their oddness gives them a way of dealing with that sugary exterior to get to the virus hiding within, which Moore likens to the chocolatey interior of the M&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When these rare antibodies appear naturally, they usually emerge too late to be of assistance to the person living with HIV. "The virus has already spread too much and they actually don't have such an effect," says Nigel Garrett, the chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we need to bring it forward before someone gets infected — catch the virus before it enters the bloodstream," he adds, explaining the vaccine development strategy. "That is a journey. You have to prime the immune system, you have to then shepherd the immune system along and then you have to polish it to ensure the [production of] the right antibody against the circulating HIV viruses."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But because the antibodies are so strange, it's very difficult to coax the body to produce them in response to a vaccine. This is what the USAID grant was intended to do — set up a series of trials that could flexibly and quickly work out the best way to encourage the immune system to create legions of these special antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know what we're trying to do," Moore says. "I'm not saying we're around the corner. It's a tough virus, but I feel like we're closer than we have ever been, and that's why I'm so frustrated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a way forward again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the cancelation of the USAID grant, everyone was just reeling. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were a lot of hugs and there were a lot of tears and there was a lot of swearing on my part," says Moore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No one wanted to scrap the vaccine project. "A devastating thing, a funding cut, yes, but we will always find a way to come back fighting," says Sheetal Kassim, the Senior Research Officer with the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation. "We are fighters."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the South African researchers on the team came up with an alternate plan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106077" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;They realized they'd have to scale back — make it a South Africa initiative only and reduce the scope of the trials. But they believed in the promise of what they had proposed, and they knew there was no time to waste. "It's important to keep the momentum going until we get to a stage where we have the epidemic under control," says Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Amelia Mfiki, the community liaison officer for the vaccine trials, the bottoming out of the USAID funding was a wakeup call.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a great opportunity for South Africa to prove that we can do things in South Africa for South Africa with South African financing," she says. "We still need support from other countries, but we shouldn't be depending solely on them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Still, there were many late nights and a lot of unease. "We were frantically writing grants to everybody who would have us — literally, any funder in any country on whether they might be willing to support the program," says Moore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106078" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Handouts briefly summarize the forthcoming HIV vaccine trial and the kinds of participants being recruited. "Communities and participants are equal partners to the researchers and to the research itself," says Amelia Mfiki, the community liaison officer.

   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the project secured funding from the &lt;a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South African Medical Research Council&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the Gates Foundation (which provides financial support to NPR). It's about a twentieth of the original USAID grant and none of it is from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about the withdrawal of funding for the trial and the possibility of future funding of such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, after nearly a year of delays, screening of participants for the pared-down trials has begun.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Cape Town, a factory building stands tall in Philippi Village, an impoverished township where HIV is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106087" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to do the work not in these communities — but &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; these communities — because these are the communities that are most affected by HIV," explains Kassim. This is "where the disease burden is highest."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The factory has been converted into a multi-use space. Mfiki makes her way to a room where 20 or so young women are waiting. "I will explain to them the criteria and who should join the trial," she says. "And this is the community that we recruit on and look for potential participants in."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The women listen attentively to Mfiki as she speaks. She knows that over the years, their participation and that of others from their community has been critical for trialing treatments for HIV — which now includes vaccine candidates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Communities and participants are equal partners to the researchers and to the research itself," she says. That's because without participants, there can be no trials and progress against HIV will stall out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106092" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Nandipha Mongo of Philippi Village was glad to have participated in an HIV trial recently. "I'm over the moon, man!," she says. For her, a vaccine against the virus would mean one thing — "living free."

   &lt;p&gt;Nandipha Mongo is one of the women attending today's meeting. She was part of another HIV trial recently, so she's not eligible to join the new vaccine trial. Still, Mongo, who's 25 years old, says she was very glad to be involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm over the moon, man!," she says proudly, acknowledging that she's making "a big difference."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mongo's community struggles with gender-based violence and unplanned pregnancies. HIV is forever stalking them. "Most of us are scared of getting HIV," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For her, a vaccine against the virus would mean one thing — "living free," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first shots of the new trial start going into participants' arms next week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term memory loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the thing that people often think about is short-term memory loss, and that really is common,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the same thing as momentarily forgetting the word you want to use or a one-off absentminded moment, like forgetting to grab your hat before going out for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s something like “having a conversation with someone and then a couple hours later, not remembering the details of that conversation,” explained Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago, said that it’s also common for folks with short-term memory loss to repeat themselves in conversations and ask “the same questions frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A hard time holding on to things that they’ve learned recently. That’s a short-term memory issue,” Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Day, there are some real-world, practical issues he tends to look for as potential memory red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for people who have made mistakes, maybe with medications, where they wouldn’t have before [such as forgetting to take it or taking a double dose], perhaps some difficulty keeping track of appointments and keeping the days straight, needing more reminders for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short-term memory loss could also look like missing appointments or showing up on the wrong day or having difficulty finding their way along a familiar route, Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally more forgetful than others and have been that way all of their lives. That’s not worrisome. Instead, Day is concerned with “changes from before that are consistent or starting to become consistent, that are beginning to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble with the ‘planning part of your brain.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for people to experience trouble with “executive functioning,” which Nothelle describes as the “planning part of your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if you have a complex task, [for example] you have to plan a dinner party and you’re having a hard time doing everything involved ... there’s all these little logistics and things to keep track of when planning something like a dinner party,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have to remember your guest’s dietary restrictions, plan out a menu, shop for ingredients, cook, arrange serving dishes, clean, make cocktails and choose a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not able to do that anymore, that can be a sign that there’s something going on,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;While dementia can present in many different ways, short-term memory loss and personality changes are among the early signs of the disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personality changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way that I have seen it manifest is people will have changes in their mood or their personality,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a loved one who used to be very outgoing is now more shy or vice versa. Or maybe someone is more apathetic or, perhaps, more impulsive than they used to be. This isn’t normal aging or an older person just not having a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all just reflections of subtle changes in the brain,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consistent trouble finding the right word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint and reason people seek medical attention is word-finding difficulty, Day said. “Occasional difficulty coming up with a name, fine,” said Day. It’s also normal to sometimes forget the name of a common object, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s inconsistent, not a concern, but when this is an everyday thing and maybe even when it’s interrupting conversation, now that’s a sign of much more prominent word-finding difficulty that would warrant evaluation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Susceptibility to financial scams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that we need to be really, really aware of, and unfortunately just gets more and more common, is susceptibility to financial scams,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with dementia are at increased risk, and scammers know that, so they tend to prey on older individuals in the middle of the afternoon,” added Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is shame involved with falling for a scam, but scammers are getting smarter and sneakier, making it easier and easier to fall for the trick, noted Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you have a loved one who falls for one of these scams, it’s worth inquiring about their cognitive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is common, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy lifestyle habits &lt;a href="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can not only slow the progression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;can not only slow the progression&lt;/a&gt; of dementia but can also help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, genetics put them at higher risk of developing dementia, but “even in people where there is a genetic component, there’s good evidence to say that all of the following still make an impact, and maybe make an even bigger impact,” Fleisher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, folks should follow the advice from their doctors when it comes to maintaining a healthy body — these habits also help maintain a healthy brain, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important things that I think about ... well, we should be screening for high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar problems, and treating or addressing those problems when they exist,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should also prioritize a good night’s sleep, he said, and manage things like sleep apnea — “addressing that and treating that effectively can really improve brain health and brain function, and, I think, decrease the risk of dementia in the future,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then there’s the day-to-day things, good brain housekeeping things, we all know we should be doing,” Day said. This includes exercising, eating a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and veggies, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alcohol-link-serious-illnesses_l_68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563?origin=life-featured" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="limiting (or not drinking) alcohol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;limiting (or not drinking) alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and quitting smoking. It’s also helpful to spend time with other people, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can sometimes seem daunting. If you’re reading a long list of things and you’re not doing any of them, you don’t have to start doing them all immediately,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take that small step forward ... introduce a 20-minute walk three times a week — you don’t have to start training for a marathon,” Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are positive steps towards brain health, and if the goal is to reduce the future risk of dementia, I think each of those steps matters and can be helpful for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a cure for dementia, these changes can help people who are diagnosed, Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to use everything at our disposal to slow down progression so people can live longer and live better and have better quality of life in that time,” Fleisher said. “There are countless examples of people living well with dementia. I think that stigma of getting this diagnosis and that being ‘the end,’ that is not where we are in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia are living rich, full lives because they’re empowered by knowledge and helpful health care teams, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOamdtMmNDT3hUa2NfRFd4NXBpVjM1dGJxWkdqbEthaGZCZkcyLVhMZG5uYzI5elNOSHRFM0pWN2pZNVFUVHlibFotYVBEb2hQczVnZmxtdW5lZFRTMmNKUVNDUlBRY0RhZy1pWms4OTNZdmhraDNvbzY2dEsyTWZIYUNTdkQyWEQxbmVxZjU5eGN1YjByQTNXWjRIWnNoZ9IBowFBVV95cUxPc1M3OTNpcFpyQTdzdnFyVHJJMFdZX09ONUVrNEJ3b2l3Rk9DRkFGaV94ZUFTWXdycjdtQW5vSHlhXy1TUmRNNTVLR0JDaVJnLTlpVU1pZGwtSncwX1ZUYWlfcUN0bjZQekVya3JUeE8zNVJaT1V5djdSOVJGMXF0NktqbWpsSXJfLVVPbVZ6azZuLWFvMHI5bm1vNFhoSk85OHZJ</guid></item><item><title>科学家将流感患者安置在健康人的房间里-没有人生病。为什么？ -女性健康</title><link>https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a70020637/healthy-people-flu-patients-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;In a new study researchers had five people infected with the flu mingle with 11 people who didn’t have the virus in a hotel room with limited ventilation, but a high air recirculation rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Ultimately, none of the healthy participants got sick, which could be due to the participants age (and natural immunity to the flu), among other factors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;Doctors say this suggests that keeping air circulating and wearing an N95 mask could be helpful in preventing the spread of the flu. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="1" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One common piece of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="advice" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lowering your risk of the flu" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lowering your risk of the flu&lt;/a&gt; is to avoid being around people who are obviously sick.

The people who were infected touched things like a pen, tablet, and microphone, which were then passed around the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;During this time, the researchers tracked the participants’ symptoms and collected daily data, like nasal swabs, saliva, and blood samples. They also measured levels of the virus in the air and in the breath of the participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, none of the healthy participants got sick.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-didnt-everyone-get-infected" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why didn’t everyone get infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are likely a few reasons for this. “Most people would find it shocking to realize that every time scientists have tried to put people in a room to see if infected people would infect uninfected people with the flu, it hasn’t worked,” Dr. Milton says. “It’s strange.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;His team guessed that this was because previous studies used lab viruses that circulated years ago (and that people had built up an immunity to), which is why they decided to use people who were naturally infected with current strains of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Milton thinks one reason why the healthy participants didn’t get sick is that they were middle-aged adults who have had years of exposure to the flu. As a result, they may have more of a natural immunity than younger people, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The study was also done during a milder flu year (2023-2024), aka not &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="this year" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Milton points out. While many of the study participants had high levels of the influenza virus in their nose, they didn’t cough. “In previous years, we saw that people who don’t cough don’t shed virus much,” he says. “Flu cases where people are coughing are the most contagious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Milton says the ventilation was “purposefully pretty bad,” with researchers sealing up doors and doing what they could to limit ventilation. But the air was also moving around the room a lot. “We wanted to have a well-mixed environment, thinking that would get everyone exposed,” he says. “It turned out that it worked the other way around. There was enough air in the room that when you had people who weren’t coughing much, everybody got exposed to a tiny amount of virus, which wasn’t enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-the-takeaway-for-staying-well" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What’s the takeaway for staying well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Doctors say there are a few things you can do with this information, whether you’re out in public or someone in your home is sick. Limiting coughing—by using cough suppressants or having the person who is sick wear a mask around others—can be helpful, according to &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Dr. Adalja agrees. “The better airflow is, the less likely that viral particles in the air land on another individual,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But one of the best ways to protect yourself is by wearing an N95 mask—especially if you’re around people who are coughing, Dr. Milton says. “Ultimately, all of these layers of protection work—that’s what this shows,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

If you drink you should do so in moderation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though our scientific understanding of alcohol has sharpened since then, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/history" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;every edition up through 2020&lt;/a&gt; has included such limits: moderate drinking is defined as one standard drink or less per day for women and two or less per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;newest edition&lt;/a&gt;, however, they're gone. Americans should "consume less alcohol for better overall health," the 2025 guidelines say, adding that pregnant women, people with alcohol use disorder, and those on certain medications should avoid it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The change is perplexing to health experts &lt;a href="https://www.alcoholpolicy.org/latest/hhs-hands-a-win-to-big-alcohol" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;nationally&lt;/a&gt; and in Wisconsin, which &lt;a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/measures/ExcessDrink" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ranks among the worst states&lt;/a&gt; for excessive drinking, and where alcohol contributes to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/states/excessive-alcohol-use-united-states.html#WI" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more than 3,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt; each year. Though drinking less is certainly the right approach, people appreciate clear and specific guidelines about alcohol, said Maureen Busalacchi, director of the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the Medical College of Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"One of the most visited parts of our website talks about serving sizes ... how much people can drink and what the risk is," she said. "By not putting that out there, that changes things. There's no reason we should back away from the research that has been coming, certainly for the last decade, in terms of health harms from alcohol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The link between alcohol and health is complex and often cherry-picked for headlines – like the notion that drinking red wine is good for the heart. (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Experts say&lt;/a&gt; red wine drinkers could have better heart health outcomes for other reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Excessive alcohol use is linked to a number of health concerns, with liver problems the most well-known among them. In Wisconsin, alcohol-related liver disease deaths &lt;a href="/story/news/2025/07/03/wisconsin-deaths-from-alcohol-related-liver-diseases-sharply-rise/84392219007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;escalated dramatically&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2023, and liver problems due to alcohol are showing up in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In recent years, awareness has also grown regarding the link between cancer and alcohol, even at moderate levels. Drinking alcohol raises a person's risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, colon and rectum, and liver cancer, as well as breast cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html#cdc_risk_factors_perpet-number-of-new-cancers-associated-with-alcohol" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5245794/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;In January 2025&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to require health warning labels on alcohol products detailing the risk of cancer, saying many Americans were unaware of them. Even women who consumed one drink daily had about a 10% higher breast cancer risk than women who did not drink, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to Murthy's advisory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi said now that more specific criteria about alcohol have been removed from the dietary guidelines, she and other public health entities will need to fill the gap. She said she wants people to understand that a pint of beer or full pour of wine is more than one &lt;a href="https://www.mcw.edu/departments/comprehensive-injury-center/wi-alcohol-policy-project/understanding-the-problem/standard-serving-sizes-and-limiting-alcohol" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;serving size of alcohol&lt;/a&gt; – defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Addressing the changes to alcohol guidance in the dietary guidelines, Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a press conference that alcohol is a "social lubricant," and while "in the best case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol," it can bring people together to bond and socialize. It hit home for some, particularly as the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-social-connection-general.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;struggles with a loneliness epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi said she doesn't disagree but did point to the number of events in Wisconsin – from watching sports to weekends at a cabin – that are based around alcohol, "a mindset that's hard to break," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The challenge is, you don't need that in order to socialize," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She did say she sees a turning tide across the state in terms of residents' relationships with alcohol, particularly this month, when many abstain from alcohol as part of Dry January – and bars and restaurants make efforts to cater to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you haven't started yet, jump into Dry January," Busalacchi said.

Too often, patients were sent home with the same advice to eat better and exercise more, even when it clearly was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was a moment I put my face in my hands and thought, 'What am I doing?' I would write a lot of prescriptions for patients' diabetes, their blood pressure, their lipids and all these other conditions," says Perreault, a professor of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine who practices in Westminster alongside primary care physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She realized that many of those medications addressed symptoms rather than the root problem. "None of these people want to be on these medications and I thought if I could just help them with their weight, many of these health concerns would probably go away," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization set the stage for a new approach that would soon reshape how weight care could work in primary care settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New System Called PATHWEIGH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault and her colleagues created PATHWEIGH, a structured process that helps patients and primary care teams focus directly on weight management. The program introduces dedicated clinic visits where providers can concentrate specifically on weight related care instead of squeezing it into a standard appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PATHWEIGH was rolled out across UCHealth's 56 primary care clinics throughout Colorado to evaluate its impact. The pilot included 274,182 patients, making it one of the largest randomized trials ever conducted in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results published by Perreault and her team in Nature Medicine showed that the program reduced population weight gain by 0.58 kg over 18 months and shifted the overall trend from steady gain to weight loss -- an outcome with major implications for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program also made patients more likely to receive help for weight issues. Participation increased the chances of receiving weight related care by 23%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With PATHWEIGH, we showed that we absolutely eliminated population weight gain across all of our primary care, which has never been done previously," Perreault says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, obesity specialists are now pointing to PATHWEIGH as a possible standard of care, and several health systems around the country are exploring how to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Clear Path to Weight Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault describes PATHWEIGH as a way to align patients and clinicians around a shared plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you think about weight loss medicine or surgery or a weight loss program, those are all vehicles to weight loss," she says. "We built a highway that we could put all the vehicles on, so there's actually a process for people to receive weight related care if they wanted it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began with something simple. Clinics posted signs letting patients know they could request an appointment focused entirely on weight management by asking at the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That request automatically activated a workflow in the electronic health record. Patients received a survey, and once completed, their responses flowed directly into the clinician's notes. This allowed visits to focus less on background information and more on practical next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It made the whole process really efficient, and then effectively turned our note template into a menu of anything that we might do," Perreault says. "It really made it extremely time efficient and consolidated everything we might do for a patient into one interface."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing Barriers and Awkward Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collected over 18 months showed that about one in four eligible patients received some form of weight related care at least once during the trial. Most of that care involved lifestyle counseling, but prescriptions for anti-obesity medications doubled during the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many one-size-fits-all weight loss programs, PATHWEIGH allowed treatment to be customized to each patient. It also reduced the discomfort that often surrounds conversations about weight in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people who want or need weight related care never get it. Either they don't ask for it or the providers don't bring it up, and if they do, the patient usually gets told to go home and eat less and exercise more, and then nothing happens," Perreault says. "The person gets frustrated and they learn to not ask for help anymore, because it's kind of embarrassing and it doesn't help. This was a safe space to say, 'Hey, if you would like medical assistance with your weight, we actually have a process for you to receive that now.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Small Changes Matter at Scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate that rising obesity rates are driven by an average population weight gain of about .5kg per year. Stopping that increase and turning it into even modest weight loss could make a meaningful difference in slowing the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While it's not a significant difference on an individual patient level, it's a huge deal on a population and public health level," Perreault says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that patients who received clear weight related care through PATHWEIGH experienced greater weight loss. Even patients who did not receive direct interventions saw reduced weight gain compared with what would normally be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Beyond Colorado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault says the program's success has opened the door to wider adoption. Plans are underway to expand PATHWEIGH beyond Colorado. The Obesity Association, which is developing its first standards of care for obesity, is highlighting the program as a recommended care process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five health systems across seven states are also considering PATHWEIGH as its creators work toward licensing the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm really proud that PATHWEIGH was home-grown and built and tested here in Colorado," Perreault says. "This is the blueprint that moves us forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We love to overcomplicate things when it comes to staying fit, but keeping it simple really is the key to long-term, sustainable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s collectively cut through the BS of “fitfluencers” and return to the “old school” basics from those who honed their craft over the years when social media wasn't dictating our workout schedules, like Arnold Schwarzenegger:&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength"&gt; progressive overload &lt;/a&gt;(slowly increasing volume over time), enough &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/protein-and-muscle-health-expert-debunks-the-30-30-rule-and-says-this-is-what-matters-most" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/protein-and-muscle-health-expert-debunks-the-30-30-rule-and-says-this-is-what-matters-most"&gt;protein &lt;/a&gt;and a balanced diet, and, most importantly, &lt;em&gt;consistency and repetition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="c0921e03-d078-487a-a668-64194e102284-2"&gt;These exercises work if you build them into your strength routine and keep at it.

Why is it unique, I hear you ask? Because the rotational motion stimulates all three of the shoulder heads, known as the anterior, lateral and posterior deltoids. That means a well-rounded shoulder workout using just one move — great if you’re short on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-overhead-press-to-build-upper-body-strength-and-muscle" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-overhead-press-to-build-upper-body-strength-and-muscle"&gt;overhead presses &lt;/a&gt;develop your pushing power and improve core strength, as you must maintain a strong, tall torso position to press without using your legs for momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arnold press is also functional, mimicking the daily task of lifting an object overhead. This is a great weightlifting move for your shoulder stabilizers as well; the rotator cuff works to support and protect your shoulders during movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zHQmiGiexh78LdfvgP2yt" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zHQmiGiexh78LdfvgP2yt slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-forward-lean-bulgarian-split-squats" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-forward-lean-bulgarian-split-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Forward lean Bulgarian split squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4cdb1a19-05aa-464c-a4fc-c4eafe501f85"&gt;Many argue the Bulgarian split squat is designed to be done with one weight, so you can decide whether you prefer using one or two dumbbells or kettlebells for this. The BSS is a glute-focused leg exercise that hits the gluteals, quads, hamstrings, calves and hips, while testing your balance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to teach a slight forward lean to engage the glutes more; this means hinging at the hips and sending your chest over your thigh while maintaining a neutral spine and straight back. It shouldn't be excessive, just enough that you hit the working glute of the front leg a little bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this exercise; it's simple yet very effective, and you just need a bench and a weight to do it. Even using your bodyweight is super efficient for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-sissy-squats" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-sissy-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ff227339-b7d2-4c66-84a1-60bcdff92c75"&gt;The sissy squat is all about the core and quads. It was supposedly popularized by the bodybuilder Vince Gironda in the 1950s and 60s, and involves isolating the quads and driving over the toes to reach a deep knee flexion. It has been a part of old school bodybuilding and modern routines since. It's also quite fun to challenge your friends and family to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your lower-body joints are working hard, but otherwise, this squat variation is designed to take out a lot of the hip work and drive the movement through your quads, creating serious strength and growth. Unlike a regular squat, you'll be on your tiptoes, helping to activate your calves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must engage your core and move slowly and with control as your knees track forward; lean back to counterbalance yourself and focus solely on your form at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a wall or squat rack for support can help you gain confidence and depth. I strongly recommend a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-improve-your-squats-and-runs-with-this-5-move-ankle-mobility-routine" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-improve-your-squats-and-runs-with-this-5-move-ankle-mobility-routine"&gt;mobility routine&lt;/a&gt; that warms your muscles and joints properly before trying this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-drag-curls" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-drag-curls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Drag curls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c2153676-5b74-4aab-b0b3-93aa64e88ea6"&gt;Drag curls work best with a barbell or EZ bar, but you can use dumbbells if you want. This exercise hits the biceps hard as you "drag" the bar up your body while keeping your elbows pulled back as you flex and extend. The weights should stay close to your body at all times as you focus on more of a vertical lift than the arc of a curl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top, it creates a strong peak contraction and hits the long head of your biceps. Your shoulders have little to do, and you're maximizing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/time-under-tension-what-is-it-and-could-it-help-you-grow-muscle" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/time-under-tension-what-is-it-and-could-it-help-you-grow-muscle"&gt;time under tension&lt;/a&gt; compared with regular&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/bicep-curls-vs-hammer-curls-which-is-best" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/bicep-curls-vs-hammer-curls-which-is-best"&gt; biceps curls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to stay controlled throughout and aim for a slow negative, which basically means slowing down the lowering motion compared with the lifting motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="21f0ff8b-e536-4f6e-8438-393cca54ad69"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull your shoulders back and down, core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and begin pulling the weight up your body, driving your elbows backward and behind you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your arms are fully flexed (the bar should be roughly in line with your lower chest), pause and squeeze your biceps hard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower the weight with control, keeping it vertical just like you did on the way up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-pullovers" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-pullovers"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pullovers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3fafb434-db87-4283-8e9d-cb1a9fd7ced7"&gt;Pullovers are touted as a shoulder exercise, but they actually work the pecs, lats (wing-shaped muscles in your back which are large and powerful), triceps and anterior deltoids. They are also surprisingly effective for improving shoulder mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper-body exercise uses strict movement, so keep your core engaged and try not to lift through your lower back; for advanced weightlifters, you might want to adopt a slight arch of your back as long as your core is switched on properly, but otherwise, your back should be supported by the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes control; as the dumbbell travels upward and lowers behind you, your range of motion increases because there's nothing but air behind the bench, which makes it harder to lift and pull back to the starting position. Only travel as far as you can control the weight and build slowly. You'll feel a deep stretch during the lower and plenty of resistance during the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-edfc0896-0320-49b7-b55d-1d165f07ffac" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="sets-and-reps-3"&gt;Sets and reps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="7e896a7a-4030-4927-bc37-9c8870ca707e"&gt;Aim for 8-12 reps and 3-4 sets of each exercise. You can pluck whichever ones you like and add them to your existing workout plan or combine all five for a full-body workout. I like to superset moves, grouping two or three into a back-to-back set, but you could go for one giant set and perform all moves as a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment below to let us know which you love (and which we should have included!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="e665f1d8-c686-4041-8d65-801db0469861"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" rel="nofollow" id="562f0dfc-da21-4e91-8913-f842154e2709" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check=""&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="39bd8f03-847c-4345-b0b9-d9a11f0f3a8a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="d6fa9263-4a25-46cb-a834-73d53780c5b3"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-more-from-tom-s-guide" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

State officials reported the cases on January 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Washington declared an outbreak on Friday after the Snohomish County Health Department has confirmed three new cases of measles in local children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious complications, including brain swelling and death in rare cases, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period for measles can be anywhere from 7 to 21 days. Once a rash forms, health officials say that is indicative of peak contagiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families are encouraged to monitor for symptoms like a measles-like rash, fever, cough or red eyes, and contact a health care provider with concerns before coming in to limit exposure to others in the waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MORE ABOUT MEASLES FROM OHA:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes. People are contagious with measles for four days before a rash appears until four days afterward. The virus particles also can linger in the air for up to two hours after someone who is infectious has left the area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measles symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. A rash usually follows, beginning on the face and spreading to the rest of the body. Symptoms begin seven to 21 days after exposure to a person with measles. Common complications of measles include ear infection, lung infection and diarrhea. Swelling of the brain is a rare but much more serious complication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measles can be dangerous, especially among infants and children younger than 5, adults older than 20, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems. In developed countries in recent years, one to two out of every 1,000 measles cases have been fatal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective at providing protection, as two doses of the MMR vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles. The risk of severe disease from measles for people who are up to date on their vaccines is very low.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:37:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxNWFdER191aXlZSHF6MGhNQlpRSHM1Ri1PRmNyNWJmb1gzRnk4VFVudjQxa0d2czBjckw3bzBfUHp3UXJLOWtPR3EyNHItYTFaUk5CNVRSRHA2R1JwYjZ6dEJQVmw4T01rcmxUYTRaRVhoMkVwNm1JZW9lajZUcy11UlJwMlJXdVJIQ09TR014cWRLdDBOUUV2VnJCYmdFV0pQcG9LY2pvRm5xYmlNdXdmT3Y1aHFtTGNZZUVfRDBvZ2JsM2loTHJ1VUlMSG1mcHk3Skl0X1FVQlA3aW91R0xIbzFiYnlfbHUydnpoR0hwTWFXRTA</guid></item><item><title>对乙酰氨基酚在怀孕期间使用不会增加自闭症、多动症的风险：综述- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/acetaminophen-pregnancy-increase-risk-autism-adhd-review/story?id=129273623</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Using acetaminophen as directed during pregnancy does not increase a child's risk of autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or intellectual disability, a major new review published Friday finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and by the brand name Tylenol, is one of the most commonly used medications in pregnancy, with doctors often recommending it as the first option for pain or fever, but in limited use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Earlier studies have produced mixed results, with some suggesting the drug may be associated with a raise in the risk of autism or ADHD in children, leaving some pregnant people unsure of how safe it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the new meta-analysis, published in the journal The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynecology &amp;amp;

Because siblings share genetics and family environment, this design helps separate the effects of the drug from family background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In sibling-comparison analyses, exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy was not associated with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD or any other intellectual disability. This conclusion held up even in studies with more than five years of follow-up, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors said the review may help explain why earlier observational studies appeared to show a possible link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People do not take acetaminophen randomly but for symptoms such as fever, infection, inflammation or pain, the authors said. These symptoms may also be linked to the brain development of a fetus, making it possible to confuse the effects of the underlying condition with effects of the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jessica B. Steier, who leads the science communication group Unbiased Science and was not involved in the review, told ABC News that not treating symptoms, such as fever, could be harmful to both the pregnant person and the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Untreated fever has documented associations with serious pregnancy and fetal risks," she explained. "The alternative pain medications -- NSAIDs, opioids -- carry their own pregnancy risks. Acetaminophen remains the safest option when medication is needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Steier added that studies linking acetaminophen use in pregnancy to autism or other conditions are vulnerable to misinterpretation and can be persuasive, especially when shared on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An HHS official told ABC News that the new analysis "does not resolve an important public health question; it sidesteps it. By excluding the vast majority of relevant evidence, privileging one study design known to bias results toward the null, and misrepresenting statistical power, the authors engineer a finding rather than evaluate causality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Khalil said patients should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time and to seek medical advice if symptoms persist, are severe or recur -- especially fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors said there are limitations to the review, including that few studies using sibling-based designs, which prevented the team from accounting for other variables that could influence the use of painkillers or lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, they add the findings of the new review align with the guidance of several professional medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Bottles of generic acetaminophen are seen in a pharmacy in Houston, September 23, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;ACOG &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/physician-faqs/acetaminophen-in-pregnancy" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; using acetaminophen when needed, following the label instructions, seeking medical guidance when appropriate and paying attention to the symptoms that prompt the drug's use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A recurring or high fever, severe pain or symptoms that aren't improving during pregnancy can signal an underlying problem that needs medical attention, according to ACOG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's always sensible to use paracetamol appropriately in pregnancy: the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, and avoid unnecessary prolonged use without medical review," Khalil said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Radhika Malhotra, MD is an internal medicine-preventive medicine resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ABC News' Youri &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Benadjaoud contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:57:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxObzlzN3RuVENoekRBcHluSVpSRFFvekNOaGJKWWJ4WVU0akZZNWZwdTJpZVBqQ3lNcXJlZExZQ2N6dDFKSzh3d1MtZEQ5OTEtVlE5bkpCRm16dHJVbzI5ZHlDRndrci1qOUdHWndTWTNqSlJKMVE5aG1BbzNCMDNLQWx4c2dFWWZzTVJJQ3o4emdTeUR3TFo0NHB0dERCS1NudjFaYm52QXHSAa4BQVVfeXFMTW42cWU2ZE9CUGxhOWljY0NZR1VGZ3lRMk9FRXZ4bGlLUnpDWFNrSGI4ZTZ0Sm8ydm5yT3JIZnlyODJwX0JGVkZZUHAtQzJNOXNwTk96T2tUdjNfRFI0V3lrVFN3RHlBRXlmc3hXVllqOGotd0NHelZoRWRMQjhLX082TEswbzhTeTRZUjJMTzIxVllSNWdSUVBqWHZRM0p4aC1IZW5tN0Vhbkxvdmd3</guid></item><item><title>田纳西州调查组织胞浆菌群时， Spring Hill女性死亡- WTVC</title><link>https://newschannel9.com/news/local/spring-hill-woman-dies-as-tennessee-investigates-histoplasmosis-cluster</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SPRING HILL, Tenn. (WZTV) — &lt;/span&gt;A Spring Hill woman’s family and best friend are speaking out after they say she died during a histoplasmosis cluster in Middle Tennessee, which is raising concerns about delayed testing and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) has confirmed to FOX 17 News that it has identified 35 cases of histoplasmosis in Williamson and Maury counties as part of its investigation. TDH said a clear source of exposure has not been identified, which the department noted is not uncommon with histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by a fungus that can be found in soil. Symptoms can resemble pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses, including cough, chest pain, fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alyssia Brown, of Spring Hill, Tennessee, pictured her alongside her roommate Kimberly Shelton and Shelton's kid, died Monday, Dec. 15, her family says.

(Photo courtesy Kimberly Shelton)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of Alyssia Brown, who lived in Spring Hill with her roommate, says Brown developed a cough shortly after moving into the home in October. Her roommate and best friend, Kimberly Shelton, told FOX 17 News the cough lasted for weeks and did not seem alarming at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we moved into this house in like October, she started developing a little bit of a cough, it really didn't seem like very much, it was just a cough that lasted for a long time,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother, Gwendolyn Brown, said she recognized the symptoms after seeing information about the histoplasmosis cluster online and reading it to her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She goes, ‘Mom, that’s literally every single symptom that I have,’” Gwendolyn Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says Alyssia Brown went to the emergency room on Dec. 8 and was treated for bronchitis. They also say she was prescribed prednisone, a steroid medication, and they believe her condition worsened afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton says when they returned for care a few days later, she repeatedly asked providers to test Brown for histoplasmosis after learning there was an alert about increased cases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we went in, they didn’t even want to test her. I had to tell them like, ‘there’s this thing going around, can you please just test her for it?’” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says a histoplasmosis test was ordered on Saturday, Dec. 13. Brown died Monday, Dec. 15, they said. The family and roommate say the test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating she was positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton said the loss has been devastating, and she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having to live my life without my best friend is beyond stupid, and I don’t want anybody else to have to go through this,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to FOX 17's questions, TDH said it cannot confirm the cause of death of individuals and does not speculate on the procedures of private healthcare providers. TDH said it shared information about the histoplasmosis cluster with area healthcare providers in a Tennessee Health Alert Network message on Dec. 3, 2025, which included information about clinical presentation, provider recommendations, and a laboratory testing timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDH also said histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout soil in Tennessee, making it challenging to prevent exposure completely. The department said people with weakened immune systems, or those exposed to a large amount of spores, face a higher risk of severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, TDH recommends avoiding outdoor activities that disturb soil and limiting contact with plant matter or bird and bat droppings. For higher-risk activities, such as cleaning chicken coops, exploring caves, or tearing down old buildings, TDH recommends wearing a protective N-95 mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother urged others to push for testing if they believe they may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ask for testing. Keep asking till you get it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s family says they are still waiting on official autopsy results, but they hope sharing her story encourages others to take persistent symptoms seriously and seek medical care if symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WTVC</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNQ0cwNmtfNW53bE9GdFpmTG5qaDlTMTBlZGdDajdYTGVkSHdXbGxsaTVjZDJjNXpxV2YyOWxpeDFpTzNkYThsd2NiY1pVYjd1Tk9Yczhsai15MWFmejZieDdOUDMwZGpzazhLVmpkaUVVNmJvdmtDVVNHVTRfZDE2bXJSb05udGlXWl80aUR1UVVaMVRtODFfWVlQSU5jNy1iODd2UnBVY0R0aEE</guid></item><item><title>Fibremaxxing ：摄入更多纤维的趋势具有令人惊讶的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lze6n0e6mo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Is fibre the new protein?

For a long time, fibre was seen as an "unsexy nutrient", explains dietitian Kate Hilton, mainly due to connotations with our bowels and flatulence, unlike protein which has long been associated with working out and getting fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When I first saw all the posts on fibre, I was pretty thrilled," says nutritionist Kristen Stavridis. "It feels like the messages around gut health are finally getting through to people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As well as benefitting your gut, eating more fibrous food - like brown rice and jacket potatoes - has other benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31809-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;People who have a higher fibre intake&lt;/a&gt; will live longer, have less cardiovascular disease, fewer cancers and are at a lower risk of conditions like diabetes," says Kevin Whelan, professor of Dietetics at King's College London. He adds that some studies suggest it can help our mental health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yeshe Sander, 24, from Birmingham, says upping the fibre in her diet to 30g a day has helped her feel "so much better" physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She grew up with parents who tried to get her to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and have a fibre-rich diet but, as she entered her mid-teens, she decided to rebel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I wanted nothing to do with healthy food," Yeshe says. "As a teenager, I would eat huge amounts of chocolate, doughnuts, cookies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At college, her favourite quick meals included instant noodles with white toast or frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It was only when I got a bit older, in my early 20s, that I thought maybe they were onto something," Yeshe says of her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After feeling sluggish, low and lacking motivation, she re-examined her diet and started to eat more healthily again.

&lt;p&gt;The common societal stigma that having a “big penis” automatically means amazing sex, “puts a lot of pressure...to perform and give their partner an out-of-this-world orgasm. These societal expectations often create performance anxiety, as many feel the need to live up to this ideal,” says DeSeta. “These expectations can increase their risk of sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction or even lead them to avoid sex altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DeSeta, people with bigger penises often experience a mix of emotions about their anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On one hand, they feel pressure to live up to the societal expectations of impressive sexual performances, and on the other, they are worried about hurting their partner,” she explained. “This combination oftentimes leads to feelings of shame or being misunderstood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.emotionstherapycalgary.ca/psychologists-therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010959" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Rod Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered psychologist specializing in sex therapy and trauma recovery, says one of the more heartbreaking patterns he’s witnessed in therapy is how those with larger penis sizes have genuinely developed trauma from repeatedly causing their partners pain during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I call it an empathic injury,” Mitchell said. “Every time your partner winces or says ‘wait, that hurts,’ you’re absorbing a micro-trauma. These men carry around the weight of having hurt someone they love, over and over, with their own body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell explained that what might look like performance anxiety is actually a trauma response — their nervous system trying to prevent harm. “Your body treats repeated sexual discomfort or pain as a threat,” he said. “Guilt rewires your brain to see intimacy as dangerous, then anxiety kicks in before sex even starts, triggering a stress response that redirects blood away from your genitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others might finish in seconds because their bodies are trying to escape the threat.

These societal expectations often create performance anxiety, as many feel the need to live up to this ideal,” says DeSeta. “These expectations can increase their risk of sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction or even lead them to avoid sex altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DeSeta, people with bigger penises often experience a mix of emotions about their anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On one hand, they feel pressure to live up to the societal expectations of impressive sexual performances, and on the other, they are worried about hurting their partner,” she explained. “This combination oftentimes leads to feelings of shame or being misunderstood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.emotionstherapycalgary.ca/psychologists-therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010959" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Rod Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered psychologist specializing in sex therapy and trauma recovery, says one of the more heartbreaking patterns he’s witnessed in therapy is how those with larger penis sizes have genuinely developed trauma from repeatedly causing their partners pain during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I call it an empathic injury,” Mitchell said. “Every time your partner winces or says ‘wait, that hurts,’ you’re absorbing a micro-trauma. These men carry around the weight of having hurt someone they love, over and over, with their own body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell explained that what might look like performance anxiety is actually a trauma response — their nervous system trying to prevent harm. “Your body treats repeated sexual discomfort or pain as a threat,” he said. “Guilt rewires your brain to see intimacy as dangerous, then anxiety kicks in before sex even starts, triggering a stress response that redirects blood away from your genitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others might finish in seconds because their bodies are trying to escape the threat. Either way, says Mitchell, the “failure” deepens the shame, and the cycle continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shame Of Having A Big Penis (No, Really)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over "especially heavy or prolonged use".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-responds-evidence-possible-association-between-autism-and-acetaminophen-use-during-pregnancy" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA says "a causal relationship" between the drug and neurological conditions "has not been established". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE81N0VVSTUyb0ZrY1p0RzUwdUlFZXRaNTNHY3dpaGxNWThMMXVuVDRrd0hFT3ZlS09xUm1pOExtalFmVy1Fb1NxbWNNMVdHV3pyOWVGUWFKSlpDQdIBX0FVX3lxTE83X09DYjFhaERxcGtvSVBPSkVRTzBGbS0zRjhuVmU5SEgwUGdKd1BLWDhoTUVmMUpxNl9aLXpKeTFXMUVXakFKMndwVVVDaFRNenZxZ2pHcnVpMXRUNnZB</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹病例激增至558例- Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://www.staradvertiser.com/2026/01/16/breaking-news/measles-cases-in-south-carolina-explode-to-558/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina reported nearly 250 new measles cases this week, official figures showed today, bringing the total of confirmed infections to 558 since October as the threat of a wider outbreak increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State epidemiologist Linda Bell said on Wednesday the risk to unprotected individuals, including those traveling to the outbreak area in the northwestern part of the state, was increasing. At least 531 people are in quarantine after being exposed to the virus, and another 85 people who are symptomatic are in isolation to keep from spreading the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is only a matter of time before a very severe or even fatal case occurs,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, noting that about one in every 1,000 measles cases results in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adalja said the larger the outbreak grows, the more difficult it will be to bring under control, and the more offshoots it will start in other parts of South Carolina and in other states, as is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, Ohio and Washington State have all reported cases linked with travel to South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is seeing a resurgence of measles. The Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, have made sweeping changes to the U.S. childhood vaccination schedule – moves that many experts say will increase vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the United States reported 2,242 confirmed measles cases, the most in three decades, putting the nation’s prized status of having eliminated local transmission of the disease at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s outbreak, which began in October, is centered on Greenville and Spartanburg Counties along the state’s northern border with North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those infected, 483 were unvaccinated, six were partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccines, 13 were fully vaccinated and 56 had unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases were reported in children in the five to 17 age group, followed by those below five years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina officials reported on Thursday two new measles cases related to the South Carolina outbreak, in Buncombe County, bringing that county’s total to five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina has set up a measles dashboard, which lists a total of seven cases since December, and urged residents to make sure their children are up to date on all childhood immunizations, including the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can hang in the air for as long as two hours. It causes rash, cough and high fevers and can lead to severe complications including pneumonia, encephalitis and suppression of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s outbreak follows a large outbreak in West Texas that started in January 2025 and infected more than 800 people in the state. Utah and Arizona are also battling outbreaks involving 201 cases in Utah and 223 in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-medical exemptions to school vaccine mandates have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic to an average of more than 3% of schoolchildren in 2023-24, compared with 0.6% in 2010-2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated. In some schools in South Carolina’s Spartanburg County, vaccination coverage is as low as 20%, Bell said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacy Ellis Matheson, public health director in North Carolina’s Buncombe County, said in a briefing this week that 87% of children in her county attend schools in which fewer than 95% of students are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got a fire raging in South Carolina, and these pockets of lower vaccination rates are kind of like tinder,” she said, adding there was the definite possibility of a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;

Her roommate and best friend, Kimberly Shelton, told FOX 17 News the cough lasted for weeks and did not seem alarming at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we moved into this house in like October, she started developing a little bit of a cough, it really didn't seem like very much, it was just a cough that lasted for a long time,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother, Gwendolyn Brown, said she recognized the symptoms after seeing information about the histoplasmosis cluster online and reading it to her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She goes, ‘Mom, that’s literally every single symptom that I have,’” Gwendolyn Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says Alyssia Brown went to the emergency room on Dec. 8 and was treated for bronchitis. They also say she was prescribed prednisone, a steroid medication, and they believe her condition worsened afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton says when they returned for care a few days later, she repeatedly asked providers to test Brown for histoplasmosis after learning there was an alert about increased cases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we went in, they didn’t even want to test her. I had to tell them like, ‘there’s this thing going around, can you please just test her for it?’” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says a histoplasmosis test was ordered on Saturday, Dec. 13. Brown died Monday, Dec. 15, they said. The family and roommate say the test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating she was positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton said the loss has been devastating, and she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having to live my life without my best friend is beyond stupid, and I don’t want anybody else to have to go through this,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to FOX 17's questions, TDH said it cannot confirm the cause of death of individuals and does not speculate on the procedures of private healthcare providers. TDH said it shared information about the histoplasmosis cluster with area healthcare providers in a Tennessee Health Alert Network message on Dec. 3, 2025, which included information about clinical presentation, provider recommendations, and a laboratory testing timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDH also said histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout soil in Tennessee, making it challenging to prevent exposure completely. The department said people with weakened immune systems, or those exposed to a large amount of spores, face a higher risk of severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, TDH recommends avoiding outdoor activities that disturb soil and limiting contact with plant matter or bird and bat droppings. For higher-risk activities, such as cleaning chicken coops, exploring caves, or tearing down old buildings, TDH recommends wearing a protective N-95 mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother urged others to push for testing if they believe they may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ask for testing. Keep asking till you get it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s family says they are still waiting on official autopsy results, but they hope sharing her story encourages others to take persistent symptoms seriously and seek medical care if symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WZTV</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:39:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPRzVkMVFvTUEyMjBtMElvbjQ3X0lUdnRyeXBZdi0tQlcwUm5LX1VkSXJSLU9melFyMVN0dXJ5dkl0QjMtQXRLcVFrQ0RwMl9HU2xEdXB0Zl82dzFYTGtXQ2RwdGJkakRuQTBSQU5tU1l2eHdRY0l5LUVZMmtESEpwNVZFS0M1SU5jNjNrbXBsQ09DeGVETXR6NXRRR2JOM3A2TUE</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情进入第七个年头，看不到尽头- Boing Boing</title><link>https://boingboing.net/2026/01/16/covid-pandemic-enters-seventh-year-with-no-end-in-sight.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;It's strange to think that the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent the world into lockdown seven years ago &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/03/18/snls-50th-celebration-sees-covid-19-spread-among-cast-and-guests.html"&gt;never ended&lt;/a&gt;. It continues to kill and cripple us, to this day. We simply stopped talking about it. Despite all the death and those forced to live their lives crippled by the after effects of the disease, the media (and I'm just as guilty of this as anyone at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times) and our governments decided to move on to new things—or at least ones that bleed in a sexy way that draws the eye. We—and I mean the world—didn't have enough ventilators or beds. Corpses floated down rivers in India. Bodies were stacked like sandbags in the back of freezer trucks as morgues overflowed. Doctors and nurses died in the same wards as the patients, days before, whom&lt;/em&gt; they had been struggling to save.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's hard to rekindle the fear and uncertainty I know I felt back then. I was worried sick for my little chosen family. I recall driving the parkways and ring road around Calgary, Canada, after dusk during the lockdown. Normally, the city, fast-growing and full of entitled drivers hungry to get home, was a sea of high-beam lights and road-stained metal. That evening, the roads were ours alone. For a moment, I thought it was funny that my phone shuffled to "Ghost Town" by the Specials. That moment passed quickly. It's so easy to forget the terrible things we survived when faced by new terrors that we don't yet know how to navigate. We don't much talk about it, but the &lt;a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/16/zjmv-j16.html"&gt;state of the pandemic right now&lt;/a&gt; is… well, not great.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the United States facing the 12th major wave of infections. Conservative estimates place cumulative COVID deaths in the United States at over 1.2 million, while excess-mortality analyses indicate a substantially higher toll. Globally, excess-mortality modeling places the true pandemic death toll in the tens of millions, with central estimates near 27 million worldwide, far exceeding official counts. Transmission continues at high rates—presently at roughly 1 million infections per day, with more than 240 million infections recorded in 2025 alone. Reinfections are widespread, and Long COVID remains a mass disabling condition affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I lie awake at night, and the intrusive thoughts in my rotation recede for long enough to hear other musings, I wonder how we can ever hope to take care of one another when we have so quickly been entirely convinced not take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Most are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a06bbc" class="body-graf"&gt;No vaccine is 100% effective, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine comes close. Two doses, usually given around age 1 and then again around age 4, are 97% effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-744142" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-kindergartner-vaccination-rates-are-lowest-rcna229455" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News data&lt;/a&gt;, the K-12 vaccination rate for MMR in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak. In neighboring Greenville County, the MMR vaccination rate was 90.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccdfb6" class="body-graf"&gt;Few people in the outbreak zone are taking advantage of free shots provided by the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-434bf0" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday and Thursday, the South Carolina Department of Public Health deployed mobile health units to Spartanburg offering free measles vaccinations. Just 18 people showed up to get the shots: nine adults and nine kids, state health officials told NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab4c70" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Eliza Varadi, a pediatrician in private practice in South Carolina, said the outbreak is centered around a community largely populated by people who immigrated from Ukraine to Spartanburg County within the past few decades. Many came to the U.S. with a level of vaccine distrust based on their experiences under Soviet control, said Varadi, who is originally from Russia. She hasn't treated patients in the current outbreak but provides care for many families from Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76f8c2" class="body-graf"&gt;“I find myself constantly having to explain that, ‘yes, these vaccines are safe,’ and ‘no, they aren't going to cause harm,’” Varadi said. “It's a lot of re-educating with a lot of families coming from that area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-07ac85" class="body-graf"&gt;About an hour and a half south of Spartanburg, in Columbia, some families can’t get the shots quickly enough. “I’ve been getting phone calls from families saying, ‘I want that vaccine, like, yesterday. I want it early. What can I do?,’” Greenhouse said. During outbreaks, babies as young as 6 months can get the shot. They’ll still need the other two doses, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd5eca" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, health officials said that someone visited the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia on Jan. 2 while they were infectious. NBC affiliate station &lt;a href="https://www.wistv.com/2026/01/14/live-update-sc-measles-outbreak-after-possible-exposure-columbia/" target="_blank"&gt;WIS reported&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 1,000 people visited the museum that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-166d58" class="body-graf"&gt;Anyone who is unvaccinated and exposed to the virus would need to quarantine for 21 days, the time it takes for symptoms to develop. There’s a work-around, however: Get the shot as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d3a37" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can identify that exposure within a short window, 72 hours, basically three days, we can give you an immunization, and your body will make its own defensive antibodies to protect you from this virus, and you can avoid quarantine,” LaCroix said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e6693" class="body-graf"&gt;Three other states have been affected by the South Carolina outbreak, including Ohio, where at least three children have been diagnosed, according to NBC affiliate station WKYC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c679b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/communicable-disease/infectious-respiratory-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-cases-and-outbreaks-north-carolina#DataNotes-11522" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; has reported eight cases since December. Seven of those are linked to South Carolina, with five in Buncombe County, near Asheville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-436d88" class="body-graf"&gt;This week, Washington state’s Snohomish County Health Department confirmed three measles cases in children who had direct contact with a family visiting from South Carolina over the holidays. The county’s health officer, Dr. James Lewis, said that while he hoped the outbreak would be contained, more diagnoses are likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6526d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“I really think there are cases out there in the community right now that are relatively mild, and people are managing at home,” Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2d5f6" class="body-graf"&gt;The children in Snohomish County are all under age 10, Lewis said. None needed to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-882975" class="body-graf"&gt;Albrecht, of Prisma Health in South Carolina, said he and his colleagues in public health are greatly worried about additional spread.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73e032" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“You should be, too,” he said. “We have right now, the largest outbreak in the U.S., and it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOa2pXX1RzZUgybWo1Z3Q0YmVUU3RhRXFIVjBHbnhGZWdZcVRzVVRxbU8xX1d4eExMZThONVFZTThKdDljdnZ1Z2ZtNjB3ZENhM1JBcnZLYjBuSVc1SG5MZTlEdVd0REQ0b3h1MUNIRjgxdzR2c1o2TFc5SWpYeUZCR1I0ME1Obmt4UXJKc2ZjdEJkMHJvZmdUWFJ0dDZxaG4tZ2UxSXpUeXlHM012Z01uaDgxMWR0NVRMUkE</guid></item><item><title>核磁共振扫描显示，即使在您“康复”之后，您的COVID-19也可能留下严重的脑损伤- ZME Science</title><link>https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/long-covid-damages-brain-after-recovery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been very eager to shove COVID under the rug and pretend like 2020 never really happened. It’s totally understandable. But for the millions who still get the disease every year, that may not be an option. The infamous “Long COVID” has been linked to debilitating fatigue and brain fog that can disrupt people’s lives for months. To make things even worse, there’s also the skepticism of the medical world and society at large who find it hard to find proof of their pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking new study from Griffith University in Australia just delivered that proof. In fact, even when people are completely recovered, their brains still look different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using advanced multimodal MRI techniques, researchers have mapped the “invisible scars” left behind by the virus. virus. The results are a vindication for patients and a warning for the public: COVID-19 leaves a distinct fingerprint on the brain’s microstructure and chemical balance, even in people who believe they have fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-recovered-paradox"&gt;The “Recovered” Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the start, COVID-19 was a medical oddity — a “respiratory” virus that can rob you of your smell, scramble your memory, or cause nausea and vomiting in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most unsettling long-term anomaly involved the “recovered” group. These are people who had COVID-19, got better, and currently report no symptoms. You’d expect their brains to look like those of the healthy controls who never caught the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they don’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that recovered individuals (COVID-RHC) had altered tissue microstructure in the brainstem, cerebellum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. The brainstem regulates vital functions like sleep and respiration, while the cerebellum handles coordination. This suggests that even a “mild” infection that you seemingly bounce back from may leave a latent neurological footprint—a silent echo of the virus that persists in the brain’s wiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We used multimodal MRI techniques to examine both grey and white matter brain regions critical for memory, cognition and overall &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/toxoplasmosis-parasite-microglia-11082020/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3428"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and found clear differences across all participant groups,” explains lead author, Dr Kiran Thapaliya. Overall, 47 participants (&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/about-30-of-covid-patients-develop-long-covid-us-study-finds-19042022/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3427"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, Recovered, and Healthy Controls) underwent 3T MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;“The unique MRI approach identified significant alterations in brain neurochemicals, brain signal intensity, and tissue structure not only in individuals with Long COVID but also in those who considered themselves fully recovered,” he said. “The research also reported that altered brain tissue was associated with symptom severity in individuals with Long COVID, suggesting the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-myelin-mystery"&gt;The Myelin Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings offer vital insights into how COVID-19 affects the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/gene-key-in-neuron-generation-discovered/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3425"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and may help explain some of the reported symptoms. But the mechanism isn’t entirely understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Long COVID patients, the scans revealed something unexpected in the precentral gyrus (motor control) and middle temporal gyrus (memory/cognition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These areas showed &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; signal intensity in myelin mapping. Myelin is the protective sheath around neurons that allows for rapid signal transmission — think of it as the insulation on an electrical wire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While early post-mortem studies of severe COVID cases showed myelin loss, this study of living Long COVID patients suggests the opposite mechanism might be at play. People are recreating the myelin, but it comes at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence of remyelination suggests the body is attempting to heal even after the viral damage has passed. The persisetnce of this process in both &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/that-2022-hepatitis-outbreak-in-kids-it-was-apparently-covid/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3426"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt; and “recovered” patients suggests we should stop viewing COVID-19 as a simple respiratory illness. Instead, we should start respecting its long-term impact on the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper ‘Altered Brain Tissue Microstructure and Neurochemical Profiles in Long COVID and Recovered COVID-19 Individuals: A multimodal MRI Study’was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625002005?via%3Dihub"&gt;Brain, Behavior, and Immunity – Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Savage microbe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever was laying waste to his eye seemed to have come from inside his own body, carried in his bloodstream—possibly the same thing that could explain the liver mass, lung nodules, and brain lesions. There was one explanation that fit the condition perfectly: hypervirulent &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; or hvKP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical &lt;em&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; is a germ that dwells in people’s intestinal tracts and is one that’s familiar to doctors. It’s known for lurking in health care settings and infecting vulnerable patients, often causing pneumonia or urinary tract infections. But, hvKP is very different. In comparison, it’s a beefed-up bacteria with a rage complex. It was first identified in the 1980s in Taiwan—not for stalking weak patients in the hospital, but devastating healthy people in normal community settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infection with hvKP—even in otherwise healthy people—is marked by metastatic infection. That is, the bacteria spread throughout the body, usually starting with the liver, where it creates a pus-filled abscess. Then it goes on a trip through the bloodstream, invading the lungs, brain, soft tissue, skin, and the eye (endogenous endophthalmitis). Putting it all together, the man had a completely typical clinical case of an hvKP infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, definitely identifying hvKP is tricky. Mucus from the man’s respiratory tract grew a species of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt;, but there is not yet a solid diagnostic test to differentiate hvKP from the classical variety. Just since 2024, researchers have worked out &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57379-4"&gt;a strategy&lt;/a&gt; of using the presence of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/1/24-1516_article"&gt;five different virulence genes found on plasmids&lt;/a&gt; (relatively small, circular pieces of DNA, separate from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate on their own and be shared among bacteria.) But the method isn’t perfect—some classical &lt;em&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; can also carry the five genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, much simpler method is the string test, in which clinicians basically test the goopy-ness of the bacteria—hvKP is known for being sticky. For this test, a clinician grows the bacteria into a colony on a petri dish then touches an inoculation loop to the colony and pulls up. If the string of attached goo stretches more than 5 mm off the petri dish, it’s considered positive for hvKP. But, this is (obviously) not a precise test.&lt;/p&gt;
