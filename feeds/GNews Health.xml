"Because we don't know where this infection originated, it's important that everyone in the Bingham school community be aware of symptoms and the possibility they were exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department warned that symptoms can usually appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash. So they advise anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms to contact their health care provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best form of protection against measles is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. It added that vaccinated people who do get measles tend to have milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications," the department noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

In hot climates, that combination can tip someone toward headaches, dizziness, darker urine, and higher heart rate-and creatine becomes an easy scapegoat instead of the overall hydration strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:48:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么麻疹疫情刚刚发生了危险的新转变- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/09/measles-outbreak-symptoms-elimination-status-outbreak</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:01:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOaWQyUlJLU09QemdlS0hqSmI2MWtsUUJpYmxpcHZJYTNCdFByczNaak5HMURWMnlqUWQyMFVlZnhfalpZcF80UzdqQjFLN055RkhKYXFtaHR2ankybElMajRpYzNXa3dfTXdzX1BuZFhrNTMzdzNZeUo2QWR0WVJCZGt0ZlhRenAzLWE3dDE3TQ</guid></item><item><title>研究声称，流行饮食可能会加速衰老- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-claims-that-popular-keto-diet-may-accelerate-aging/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strict form of the keto diet has been linked to faster cellular aging in males, while females on the same plan did not show the same damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference appears to come down to sex hormones and how they shape the way cells handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new work, male animals on a very high fat, very low carbohydrate diet built up damaged, nondividing cells in the heart and kidneys over just a few weeks, while females were largely spared the same burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments were run by a team at UT Health San Antonio, raising sharp questions about whether similar patterns could emerge in men who stay on keto diets for long stretches of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-diet-and-aging"&gt;Keto diet and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by David Gius, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology at &lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Health San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. His research focuses on how metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-keep-an-hourly-rhythm-shaping-mood-and-energy/"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt;, and stress inside cells shape aging and disease across different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the ketogenic diet, a very low carbohydrate, high fat way of eating, is designed to push the body away from sugar and toward fat as its main energy source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body’s primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat,” explained Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carb intake stays low enough, the liver produces ketones, small fuel molecules made from fat that can power the brain and other organs when glucose is scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully planned ketogenic programs are a long standing therapy for drug resistant epilepsy, and a pediatric hospital keto &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27373-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinic&lt;/a&gt; has reported large seizure reductions in many children without major growth problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-aging-and-keto-diets"&gt;Studying aging and keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one mouse &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725007971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, male animals fed a keto diet for several weeks showed a spike in markers of cellular aging called senescence, a state where stressed cells stop dividing but stay alive and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These senescent cells piled up in the heart and kidney, along with higher levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female mice on the same diet did not show the same surge in senescent cells or inflammatory signals over that time window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their heart and kidney tissue stayed closer to normal, even though their blood ketone levels confirmed they were in ketosis just like the males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male mice also showed strong signs of oxidative stress, an overload of reactive oxygen containing molecules that chip away at fats, proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-autism-to-neanderthal-dna-genetic-variants-found-in-modern-humans/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage markers such as oxidized lipids and modified proteins climbed in male organs on keto, while female tissues again remained largely unchanged under the same feeding plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older female mice with naturally lower estrogen levels began to look more like the males when they were placed on a ketogenic diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed more senescent cells and oxidative damage, linking the protection seen in younger females to hormone status rather than sex alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-oxidative-stress-and-aging-cells"&gt;Hormones, oxidative stress, and aging cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea directly, the team treated some male mice with estrogen, a major female sex hormone that also influences metabolism and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those males no longer showed the keto driven rise in senescent cells or oxidative damage, suggesting that estrogen was actively buffering their tissues against stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective role fits with broader research showing that estrogen can tune up the cell’s own defense systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, estrogen replacement &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to switch on antioxidant and longevity related genes and to lower several measures of oxidative stress, supporting the idea that hormone status changes how tissues weather metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tried a different route, giving male mice classic antioxidants, compounds that neutralize reactive oxygen molecules before they harm cell structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, and a drug that mimics the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD, all cut back the buildup of senescent cells and oxidative damage in keto fed males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those antioxidant treatments also brought inflammatory blood markers down toward normal in the male mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the hormone and antioxidant experiments suggest that the diet itself creates extra oxidative pressure, but hormones and chemical defenses can either blunt or amplify the impact on aging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-in-real-people-risks-and-uses"&gt;Keto in real people, risks and uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal work like this does not translate directly to humans, which the researchers themselves stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://dom.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, human data already show that keto style patterns are not neutral for the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a randomized feeding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy young women following a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat diet developed very high LDL cholesterol levels compared with when they ate a more conventional non keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broad cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280624000410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; concludes that low carbohydrate patterns can bring quick drops in weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar, yet they do not outperform other eating styles for long term cardiovascular outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review also flags safety questions, including nutrient gaps, kidney strain, and possible effects on arterial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate work in male mice found that long periods of keto feeding led to fat buildup in the liver and worse glucose control, changes that eased after switching back to standard chow in one &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1290540/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mixed findings underline that keto is a strong &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-extracts-may-help-treat-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic &lt;/a&gt;tool, not a harmless shortcut, and responses can vary across bodies and over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-lessons-from-keto-diets"&gt;Aging lessons from keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mouse work suggests that deep carb restriction might speed the accumulation of senescent cells in some tissues, at least in male animals with typical hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of cellular aging is linked in other research to stiffer hearts, weaker kidneys, and chronic low grade inflammation as organisms grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, ketogenic therapy remains a vital option for some people with severe epilepsy when other drugs fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” said Routhenstein, who emphasized the need for professional guidance when such a restrictive diet is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people drawn to keto mainly for weight loss or short term glucose control, the picture is more unsettled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings add sex and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; status to a growing list of factors that likely shape who does well, who runs into trouble, and how long such a diet should reasonably continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this research, one message stands out clearly: very low carbohydrate, very high fat diets act as powerful metabolic stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering them as a lifestyle choice, rather than a time limited medical therapy, needs careful medical supervision, regular lab checks, and an honest look at whether less extreme changes could meet their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00797-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007971%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

						A southern Iowa school district has canceled classes Tuesday, Dec. 9 and Wednesday, Dec. 10 due to illness. An official with the Moulton-Udell School District, in Appanoose County, told KCCI about 30% of students and staff are out — many with influenza A. "We will use this time to fully sanitize our facilities and provide a needed health reset for our students, staff, and families," the school posted on its Facebook page. Athletic events and other activities are also canceled.Last month, following the state's first flu-related death of the season, KCCI spoke to several medical professionals about how to stay healthy this winter. State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse issued a statement urging Iowans to talk with their doctors about getting the flu shot and reminding anyone who is ill — or whose children are ill — to stay home. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services also recommends that Iowans:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.» Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play

Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;» &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KCCI" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fkcci-8-news-des-moines%2Fid505215818&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kcci.com%2Farticle%2Fiowa-school-district-cancels-classes-tuesday-wednesday-due-to-widespread-illness-moulton-udell%2F69665507&amp;amp;xcust=undefined" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hearst.android.kcci&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="screen-reader-only"&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;U.S. health officials have issued travel advisories for Americans planning trips to certain tropical countries amid outbreaks of an untreatable mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that it has issued Level 2 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/cuba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;travel advisories for Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Guangdong Province in southern China, advising Americans to "practice enhanced precautions" when visiting these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say there are currently no treatments for chikungunya, but the disease is vaccine-preventable, and vaccination is recommended for travelers to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of the virus include fever and joint pain, though patients may also experience headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or a rash, according to health officials. Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR, AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

established to help support the family — particularly her mother, Terese, who had to take time off work to stay with her daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fundraiser explained, Joyce had been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder, which “left her immune system compromised, her organs with extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid.” The once active teen — she was a member of the Ohio State Club Dance Team and active in her parish’s youth ministry program — was left bedridden due to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, died from a rare disorder caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin has been contained to 4 tiny walls in a hospital room for many weeks now as doctors try to understand more about her rare condition. This has come with daily blood draws, blood transfusions, bone marrow tests and so many more treatments that I can’t even remember the names of,” the GoFundMe explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin is unable to do simple tasks that many healthy individuals take for granted. Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin cannot partake in. She fatigues quickly making it hard for her to walk short distances. Things like living in the dorms, dining in dining halls, going to OSU football games, going to in person classes, going to Mass [at] the Newman Center and even dancing are all things she hasn’t been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus often won’t cause symptoms, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23469-epstein-barr-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97% of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals who do get measles tend to experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms should call their healthcare provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus," the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jordan School District sent the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jordan School District is working closely with the Salt Lake County Health Department to address a confirmed measles case associated with Bingham High School’s Daycare Program.

Alyssa is doing her A-levels, the Duke of Edinburgh Award, eyeing up driving lessons and planning her future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm looking into doing an apprenticeship in biomedical science, and hopefully one day I'll go into blood cancer research as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The team at University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital used a technology called base editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it from one type to another and rewriting the instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Researchers wanted to harness the natural power of healthy T-cells to seek out and destroy threats and turn that against the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is a tricky feat. They had to engineer the good T-cells to hunt the bad ones without the treatment annihilating itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They started with healthy T-cells from a donor and set about modifying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The first base edit disabled the T-cells' targeting mechanism so they could not attack the patient's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The second removed a chemical marking, called CD7, which is on all T-cells. Removing it is essential for preventing the therapy from self-destructing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The third edit was an "invisibility cloak" that prevented the cells being killed by a chemotherapy drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now the modified T-cells would destroy every other T-cell they found whether they were cancerous or healthy, but they would not attack each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The therapy is infused into patients and if their cancer cannot be detected after four weeks, then patients have a bone marrow transplant to regrow their immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A few years ago, this would have been science fiction," says Prof Waseem Qasim from UCL and Great Ormond Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to basically dismantle the entire immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's a deep, intensive treatment, it's very demanding on the patients, but when it works, it's worked very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reports the results of the first 11 patients treated across Great Ormond Street and King's College Hospital.

already agree that beta-blockers are crucial when the heart’s pumping strength is clearly reduced, measured as a “low left ventricular ejection fraction.” This refers to the share of blood pumped out with each beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people whose pumping strength looks normal, with no heart failure or rhythm problems, several expert groups have questioned whether staying on the drug for years really adds much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-new-trial-tested"&gt;What the new trial tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the BETAMI and DANBLOCK &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, researchers enrolled adults who had recently survived a myocardial infarction in hospitals across Norway and Denmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every participant had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; of at least 40 percent and no signs of heart failure, which meant their hearts were still pumping reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first couple of weeks after the heart attack, about half the patients were randomly assigned to long term beta-blocker treatment and the rest to no beta-blocker at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events like death, new heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, unplanned procedures to reopen arteries, and dangerous rhythms were tracked for a median of 3.5 years and compared using a hazard ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking a beta-blocker had fewer events of death or serious cardiovascular complications than those who did not, with a hazard ratio of 0.85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 95 percent confidence interval, from 0.75 to 0.98, indicates that this difference is unlikely to be due to chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-team-found"&gt;What the team found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers broke the outcome into pieces, they saw that new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attacks occurred in 5.0 percent of patients on beta-blockers, compared with 6.7 percent in those not taking them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of stroke, heart failure, unplanned coronary procedures, and serious rhythm disturbances stayed very low and quite similar between the two groups, and deaths from any cause were rare in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the trial did not reveal any major safety problems with long term use in this selected group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious side effects strong enough to make patients stop the medicine were uncommon, which provides some reassurance for people already taking these drugs after a recent heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-beta-blockers-matter"&gt;Why beta-blockers matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who leave the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hospital-food-puts-patients-at-risk-and-the-planet/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; with a heart that still pumps fairly well, doctors have struggled with whether a beta-blocker really improves survival or simply adds extra pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial suggests that, at least for people with preserved or mildly reduced pumping function and no arrhythmia, an abnormal or irregular heart rhythm, the treatment can lower the chance of another major event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit is modest rather than dramatic, so the decision to continue or start a beta-blocker still needs to balance possible tiredness, low blood pressure, or cold hands against the reduction in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many younger or higher risk patients, especially those with mildly weakened heart pumping, that tradeoff may still come out in favor of staying on the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-still-remain"&gt;Questions still remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At almost the same time, another large &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2512686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a study that combines data from several clinical trials, reported that beta-blockers did not improve survival or prevent new heart attacks in patients whose ejection fraction was at least 50 percent after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work pooled individual patient data from five randomized studies and painted a more skeptical picture for people whose hearts appear completely normal on pumping tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01592-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; focused only on people with mildly reduced ejection fraction between 40 and 49 percent found clear benefit from beta-blockers in preventing repeat heart attacks and heart failure episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern, where patients with slightly weakened hearts gain the most, is supported by pooled data from European and Japanese trials that were reanalyzed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these mixed results explain why many guideline committees have not rushed to make sweeping changes for patients with normal heart function after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will probably focus on teasing apart which subgroups, defined by age, sex, heart pumping strength, and other illnesses, truly gain enough from beta-blockers to justify long term treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone recovering from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack, the practical message is simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication decisions should never be changed on their own, and the best next step is a detailed conversation with a treating cardiologist who can weigh personal risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985?query=featured_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

chemicals probably increases the risk of infant mortality and other harm to newborns, a new peer-reviewed study of 11,000 births in New Hampshire finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first-of-its-kind University of Arizona research found drinking well water down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site was tied to an increase in infant mortality of 191%, pre-term birth of 20%, and low-weight birth of 43%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was also tied to an increase in extremely premature birth and extremely low-weight birth by 168% and 180%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings caught authors by surprise, said Derek Lemoine, a study co-author and economics professor at the University of Arizona who focuses on environmental policymaking and pricing climate risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know if we expected to find effects this big and this detectable, especially given that there isn’t that much infant mortality, and there aren’t that many extremely low weight or pre-term births,” Lemoine said. “But it was there in the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also weighed the cost of societal harms in drinking contaminated water against up-front cleanup costs, and found it to be much cheaper to address Pfas water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Extrapolating the findings to the entire US population, the authors estimate a nearly $8bn negative annual economic impact just in increased healthcare costs and lost productivity. The cost of complying with current regulations for removing Pfas in drinking water is estimated at about $3.8bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are trying to put numbers on this and that’s important because when you want to clean up and regulate Pfas, there’s a real cost to it,” Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are widely used across the economy, and industrial sites that utilize them in high volume often pollute groundwater. Military bases and airports are among major sources of Pfas pollution because the chemicals are used in firefighting foam. The federal government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/pfas-contaminating-drinking-water" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that about 95 million people across the country drink contaminated water from public or private wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/05/pfas-sperm-count-mobility-testicle-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raised concern&lt;/a&gt; about the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/forever-chemicals-found-umbilical-cord-blood-samples-studies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas exposure&lt;/a&gt; on fetuses and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among those are toxicological studies in which researchers examine the chemicals’ impact on lab animals, but that leaves some question about whether humans experience the same harms, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other studies are correlative and look at the levels of Pfas in umbilical cord blood or in newborns in relation to levels of disease. Lemoine said those findings are not always conclusive, in part because many variables can contribute to reproductive harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new natural study is unique because it gets close to “isolating the effect of the Pfas itself, and not anything around it”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers achieved this by identifying 41 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; sites contaminated with Pfoa and Pfos, two common Pfas compounds, then using topography data to determine groundwater flow direction. The authors then examined reproductive outcomes among residents down gradient from the sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers chose New Hampshire because it is the only state where Pfas and reproductive data is available, Lemoine said. Well locations are confidential, so mothers were unaware of whether their water source was down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site. That created a randomization that allows for causal inference, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study’s methodology is rigorous and unique, and underscores “that Pfas is no joke, and is toxic at very low concentrations”, said Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst with the Environmental Working Group non-profit. The group studies Pfas exposures and advocates for tighter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is in part effective because mothers did not know whether they were exposed, which created the randomization, Evans said, but she noted that the state has the information. The findings raise questions about whether the state should be doing a similar analysis and alerting mothers who are at risk, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemoine said the study had some limitations, including that authors don’t know the mothers’ exact exposure levels to Pfas, nor does the research account for other contaminants that may be in the water. But he added that the findings still give a strong picture of the chemicals’ effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Granular activated carbon or reverse osmosis systems can be used by water treatment plants and consumers at home to remove many kinds of Pfas, and those systems &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.5c00519" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also remove other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Biden administration last year put in place limits in drinking water for six types of Pfas, and gave water utilities several years to install systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration is moving to undo the limits for some compounds. That would probably cost the public more in the long run. Utility customers pay the cost of removing Pfas, but the public “also pays the cost of drinking contaminated water, which is bigger”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 20:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOZTNyX3lvWmtjamNOTXhFLTMxZ3gtMjZQOEdRUGticlJ2dG9obVpueDVVdHh2Mzl3Ui1vZXBOOU9wc1c3RFNaVzBWenc3TDVrZ1o1YzZFZ0w4dlBvX05sUGF1ZXQxTnJ6YmM3OE1OX0RRQ1BnRk5VSlZueDIxZmNIT2RnQmFmX2VRSFhIME5WbUc1dFZn</guid></item><item><title>有史以来第一次，单个基因的突变与精神疾病有关-连线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/mutations-in-a-single-gene-have-been-linked-to-mental-illness/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;A team of&lt;/span&gt; physicians specializing in genetics and neurology discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/mental-health/"&gt;mental illnesses&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/schizophrenia/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; are closely linked to mutations in the GRIN2A gene. The scientists mantain that identifying this genetic risk factor opens up the possibility of designing preventive therapies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The GRIN2A gene regulates communication between neurons by producing the GluN2A protein. When functioning optimally, it promotes the transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells and facilitates essential processes such as learning, memory, language, and brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In their article, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03279-4"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the researchers demonstrated that the gene mutation reduces the activity of the NMDA electrical receptor, which aids in neuronal communication, thereby increasing the risk of developing mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Of the 121 individuals studied, 85 had a GRIN2A variant and 23 of them developed a mental illness. These results show that carriers of the mutation have a significantly higher risk than those without variations. Furthermore, the patients exhibited strictly psychiatric symptoms, which largely rules out environmental or contextual explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The finding contradicts the general consensus on the polygenic origin of mental disorders. Until now, clinicians have considered that these diseases arise from the interaction of multiple factors, including genetic ones. This study demonstrates for the first time that a mutation in a single gene can decisively influence the development of a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The report also cites previous research that treated NMDA receptor deficiency, caused by the GRIN2A mutation, with L-serine, an amino acid. The four schizophrenia patients who participated in the trial showed remarkable improvements: disappearance of hallucinations, remission of paranoia symptoms, and improved behavior after receiving the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As this trial was conducted prior to the main study, the authors clarify that it cannot yet be considered a definitive therapeutic method. However, they point out that the efficacy of L-serine can be confirmed in a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Schizophrenia Remains a Huge Enigma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental illness that manifests itself with delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and language, behavioral changes, and loss of motivation or pleasure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disorder affects some 23 million people worldwide, equivalent to 0.29 percent of the global population. In adults, the rate rises to 0.43 percent, meaning that 1 in every 233 people develops it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Specialists now have a good understanding of its symptoms and have identified the age ranges in which it typically appears. Effective therapies exist, and several risk factors are recognized, including genetics, neurochemistry, and external elements such as stress or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Even so, science has not identified a single cause or fully explained the variability among those at risk. Some people develop the illness and others do not, even if both parents have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is also no clear strategy for preventing its onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story first appeared in &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/por-primera-vez-en-la-historia-encuentran-un-gen-vinculado-directamente-con-una-enfermedad-mental"&gt;WIRED en Español&lt;/a&gt; and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 18:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRFEtMjZsdkhlT1VCcG9VdzQ0S1d2cm4xTzFfY0lvVmRZa1lYaTJhdG9TVFZJZDZJVDJjWTJKVmZsVUZvdHVVTlg0by0tNDRYSHJYMnJJZi00bUxaYkRSWXpVcVZUdW11M09mZV9HMndvc3ROdV9iYmIyV2lPUXJmbHRxU3Vpa1dTcE1ST3Jna2xIN092</guid></item><item><title>高传染性诺如病毒在伊利诺伊州迅速传播：须知-补丁</title><link>https://patch.com/illinois/oakforest/highly-contagious-norovirus-spreading-rapidly-il-what-know</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nasty, highly contagious form of norovirus called “winter vomiting disease” is spreading across the country, including in Illinois, according to an analysis of wastewater at two surveillance sites in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases typically spike after Christmas and New Year’s gatherings, but the number of new cases in November showed a notable increase, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC tracks norovirus through voluntary reporting from clinics and state health departments, but says such data is unreliable because most people who get it are miserable for a few days, but don’t seek medical attention or require hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency doesn’t monitor viral activity in wastewater; however, data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=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%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=cf0a18" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt;, an academic program through Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, shows that norovirus has been rising nationally since mid-October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Illinois, monitoring sites in Wheaton and Glen Ellyn are tracking the virus.

Some health experts worry that the variant GII.17, which was responsible for last year’s spike, may have mutated and become more contagious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GII.4 strain dominated norovirus outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; for more than 30 years, but last year, the GII.17 mutation was responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;75 percent of outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; there are two possibilities: Either the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or changes in the population made more people susceptible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And probably it’s a combination of both,” Atmar said. “But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the GII.17 strain include forceful vomiting, intense diarrhea and stomach cramps that are especially hard on children under 5, adults over 85, and those with underlying health conditions, according to the CDC. Dehydration is a primary risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because GII.17 is a new strain, people have less built-up immunity and may experience more severe illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When new strains emerge, people are exposed to a strain that they have not previously been exposed to, and hence are more likely to get infected,” Lee-Ann Jaykus, a professor in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University, &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/winter-vomiting-disease-surges-ahead-of-schedule-norovirus-11154741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Historically, new strains emerge every seven to 10 years, and we were due for one, so this is not surprising,” Jaykus said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vigorous hand-washing with hot water and soap and other good hygiene practices are crucial to limit the spread of norovirus. It spreads easily, either through direct contact with someone who is sick, eating food or drinking liquids contaminated with the virus, touching contaminated surfaces, and poor hand-washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 18:06:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQZG5ud0JYdHJ4UDBRWFI1MFVZZlprUEg1eWpOTmFQd2lBcWYzbG0yM1BVVmRqMWJ2bFpTblpHRGhldExrWkF3Yzd3TEJiQXBfNkVwVjNteUJPQUV0RE5WM3NIM2NkbW9sQy1pMm1qMzRESmJzOGxfdUZFTlBRNXc0YmdGbV9Ra2lXRmFUZVN5SjNzOEdTYmtfVGt1UdIBtAFBVV95cUxNbmVGV0IwNHNhcUFUYWhfZXgzWm0wS1dUYXliRHhvUVlVbzI5R1oteWxFS2wzck5Hc3R6OHdXc2hJTk5xUHY0QlpRdTlYaEE5MjhzNnBoQjVCcnVSeVlQQlZNNEJMMUVvdHhWSGh4dHhWSzVxSFYtdTNSOXQySEZOOEYzNmFveFBuX0k1QjZUNDhPVmdCM2xsSVhIeFQtUm9SMkttdEE4VFdmYjNwdFF2UTZOV3M</guid></item><item><title>当日汤品：冬季每晚喝鸡汤的5个理由-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/soup-of-the-day-5-reasons-to-drink-chicken-soup-every-night-in-winter/articleshow/125842051.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steaming hot, filled with spices and crunchy with chicken, a bowl of chicken soup ticks all the boxes on your taste buds and has you craving one sip after another. Bad day at work, fight with a friend or under the weather, there's not one problem chicken soup can't fix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has a lot to do with nostalgia and comfort, with the taste of the dish, it is also related to its numerous health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chicken soup: America's favourite soup&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America, chicken soup is typically made with noodles, it's chicken noodle soup! While the origin of the delicious dish can be traced back to ancient China, chicken soup came to be considered as food for therapy back in the 60 AD. Pedanius Dioscorides, an army surgeon who served under the Roman emperor Nero, had a five-volume encyclopedia called 'De Materia Medica' which included the benefits of the soup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia and 12th-century medical scholar Moses Maimonides, recommended chicken soup for respiratory disorders, colds, flu and asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With recommendations tracing back generations, recipes being handed down in families, and a love that lasts a lifetime, chicken soup reigns in American households in winter. But what are you really gaining from the steaming bowl of heaven? Let's find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional value of chicken soup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken soup is often called the "Jewish penicillin" and for all the right reasons.

The vegetables, chicken and broth supply the body with many kinds of nutrients that build up the body's defences. A 2022 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9411684/#sec0001" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Poultry Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that chicken soup alleviates immune suppression by improving peripheral blood levels and stimulating the secretion of immunoglobulin and cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gelatin found in chicken bones is rich in amino acids that support gut health. Drinking chicken soup can soothe the digestive tract and the inner lining of the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandy Allonen, a clinical dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, shared that chicken is high in tryptophan which helps the body produce serotonin, the happy hormone that enhances the mood and provides 'comfort', in a hospital press release. Moreover, a 2009 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228338525_Effect_of_Chicken_Soup_Intake_on_Mood_States_and_Peripheral_Blood_Flow_in_Humans" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Health Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that a 2-week intake of chicken soup significantly reduced tension and anxiety and significantly increased peripheral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enhances joint health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9411684/#sec0001" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Poultry Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found chicken soup to be rich in collagen and peptides. People who consumed chicken-derived collagen saw a 36.9% reduction in joint pain compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, as per a 2021 Nutrients study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves cold&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best-known benefits of chicken soup is how it helps reduce the severity of a cold. A 2025 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that chicken soup reduced symptoms of a cold and shortened the duration of illness. They also found the soup to lower certain markers in the blood that show inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with these health benefits, its delicious taste makes chicken soup a beloved winter food. Thus, keep making that steaming bowl and enjoy sip by sip while cosying up under your blankets and watching your favourite comfort show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Jeff Landry has appointed Evelyn Griffin, a doctor who has worked on maternal mortality and voiced skepticism about vaccines, to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/ralph-abraham-vaccine-louisiana-cdc/article_5b8e4661-9d47-4da1-886f-1b11cf4ed6cb.html"&gt;Louisiana's next surgeon general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œHer clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role,â€� Gov. Jeff Landry said in a release Monday announcing Griffinâ€™s appointment. â€œWith Dr. Griffin stepping in, Iâ€™m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Griffin is a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the top vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was appointed to the panel by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has campaigned against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/national_politics/hepatitis-b-rfk-cassidy-vaccines/article_39be244b-cdd8-4919-a2a5-5109694add12.html"&gt;ACIP voted&lt;/a&gt; to end a three-decade-old recommendation that all infants get the Hepatitis B vaccine and issue weaker guidance for some newborns. Griffin supported that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In a news release announcing her appointment, Landry's office said Griffin's "work included a focus on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality." Louisiana's rates of such deaths is among the highest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin replaces Ralph Abraham, who recently left the statewide post to take a top position at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He drew scrutiny for his decision to end mass vaccination campaigns in the state and for casting doubt over COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D supplements become more popular in the winter because reduced sunlight raises the risk of deficiency. Taking your supplement at the right time may help you get the most benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen is typically sold as a supplement, while gelatin is more common in cooking and has far less research on its health benefits. Collagen dissolves in water, and your body absorbs collagen—especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/collagen-peptides-benefits-11711747" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;collagen peptides&lt;/a&gt;—more quickly than gelatin.

More notably, those who had been vaccinated were a quarter less likely to die in the following four years from any cause than those who were not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a leaked memo from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) – since &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/12-former-fda-heads-call-out-fdas-leaked-memo-claiming-covid-19-vaccines-killed-children-in-bid-to-change-policy-81792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;rejected by 12 former FDA heads&lt;/a&gt; – made claims of 10 deaths allegedly caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. The author, CBER head Vinayak Prasad, provided no details to allow others to assess the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientific studies have been done to test the safety of mRNA vaccines, they have consistently refuted Prasad’s claims, instead showing vaccination to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/largest-real-world-covid-19-vaccine-study-confirms-overwhelming-safety-60785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt; for all ages than infection with the virus. However, the new study, led by French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products researcher Laura Semenzato, stands out in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the sample size is enormous. In countries where individuals need to agree to provide data on their vaccination status and subsequent outcomes, large sample sizes are expensive. Some studies have tried to get around this by using regional statistics, which show death rates were higher where &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vaccinations were least common&lt;/a&gt;, but this approach can’t prove the deaths were among the unvaccinated, logical as that might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Semenzato and co-authors had access to the entire French health data system, where every resident has a number against which their vaccination status and medical outcomes are recorded. This allowed the team to track the outcomes for 28.7 million people, of whom 22.8 million received the first dose of an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 between May and October 2021. Those who were vaccinated outside this window or received a non-mRNA vaccine (which was rare in France) were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Semenzato and co-authors looked at deaths from all causes, not just COVID-19, over 45 months, rather than six or 12 months, as has been more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some anti-vaccination campaigners have limited their opposition to COVID-19 shots to younger people. Semenzato’s study looked at those aged between 18 and 59 on November 1, 2021, so the findings cannot be dominated by those old enough to be considered most at risk of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In raw terms, those who had been vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were found to have a 74 percent lower risk of death from COVID-19 in hospital. Turning to overall deaths, the researchers found that 0.4 percent of the vaccinated cohort had died after almost four years had passed, but this rose to 0.6 percent among the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this doesn’t fit well with Prasad’s claims, and certainly contradicts the wild claims found on social media that mRNA vaccines have “killed millions”, on its own, it’s hardly conclusive. If the populations were not identical – for example, if the unvaccinated contained more people with serious pre-existing health conditions – vaccinations might have nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, records revealed the opposite. Those who got vaccinated were slightly older (by just under a year) on average, and more likely to be women. At the time vaccinations were occurring, those who got vaccinated were also more likely to have potentially dangerous cardiometabolic conditions (9.3 percent compared to 7.8 percent for unvaccinated individuals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French data doesn’t provide data on individual income, but it does indicate people’s approximate residence. Those who lived in the poorest 20 percent of localities were somewhat less likely to get vaccinated, but the difference was fairly modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing for all these factors, the team concluded that mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 was associated with 25 percent lower mortality from any cause. Notably, that includes things like car accidents and natural disasters, which are highly unlikely to be affected by vaccination status. In the first six months after vaccination, the gap was even larger, with deaths among the vaccinated 29 percent lower than the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the mortality gap may not be attributable to the protective effects of the vaccine alone, however.  The reasons why people were not vaccinated during the study period are not known, but it's possible that some of them were swayed by false claims about the vaccine’s dangers. The authors tactfully refer to this and other unknowns, such as education, as residual confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disentangling the effect of the vaccine alone, therefore, will be difficult, but with death rates so low among the vaccinated, claims that the vaccine presents a significant risk to life now appear more implausible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JAMA Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 17:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxNcUU5M3JGYm9QcUZVeVQzZEpPY2xQRnBpLUJFdUJ0cEE2NW9qNmhUVnpRMmNpR2ctVXB6dE9sTTA3ZlFjYWVFV1p2c29EN1Rtb1BsUEtiRUE0cnI2eUVOdGdFeU95eXlwRGFRRG05WDV3YThPdzgyVHE5MEhHM255ampwSHZKZjNPNHRlMFZhaW5OYVlyZVJWM2JCdFl3a1dkdTQtMW9yNldUc1FkNmhBX3ZlNkNkcTJrMzh1d2dmaTNkUk5scXFlUk1SYkRPNDIxVWNZTS1n</guid></item><item><title>每日29便士的“健美运动员”补充剂，可以减少身体脂肪-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15364509/bodybuilders-supplement-body-fat-boost-energy-counteract-effects-Mounjaro-creatine.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Hickman about his experience as a self-described vagabond, hobo, and hitchhiker in the United States. Hickman’s story is receiving a wide range of reactions, from praise for his writing to criticism of his ideas. As always, we love publishing essays like this that offer fresh, engaging perspectives and drive dialogue and debate. &lt;a href="https://www.readtangle.com/the-drifters-lament-i-miss-being-homeless/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;You can read Hickman’s story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;paywalled for free subscribers&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="quick-hits"&gt;Quick hits.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;President Donald Trump released his National Security Strategy document, outlining his foreign policy vision. The document calls for U.S. supremacy in the Western Hemisphere and increased strength in the Indo-Pacific, while also calling on Europe to address issues related to demographic change. (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-strategy-document-revives-monroe-doctrine-slams-europe-2025-12-05/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Supreme Court announced that it will hear arguments on &lt;em&gt;Trump v. Barbara&lt;/em&gt;, a case challenging the Trump administration’s executive order ending birthright citizenship in the U.S. (&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/12/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-trumps-challenge-to-birthright-citizenship/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) Separately, the Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in a challenge to President Trump’s attempt to fire Rebecca Slaughter as Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. The case could roll back protections against removal for members of independent agencies. (&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-v-slaughter-ftc-commissioner-firing-humphreys-executor/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would not commit to releasing footage of the U.S. military’s second strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in September, which has prompted heightened congressional scrutiny over the past week. (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5637523-hegeth-boat-strikes-video-release/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The latest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the second phase of the Israel–Hamas ceasefire in Gaza to commence soon, though he did not specify the timeline.

Most of the package will go toward the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which supports U.S. crop farmers. (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-to-unveil-12-billion-bailout-for-farmers-064eb1de?mod=hp_lead_pos4&amp;amp;ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-topic"&gt;Today’s topic. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new hepatitis B vaccine guidance. On Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5635408-cdc-vaccine-hepatitis-b-newborns/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 8–3 to eliminate a longstanding recommendation that all newborns receive a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. The committee instead recommended that women who test negative for hepatitis B should consult with their doctors to determine whether their babies should be given the first dose of the vaccine, suggesting that the initial dose be administered after the infant is at least two months old. The committee voted on the change after it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cdc-panel-remade-by-rfk-jr-votes-to-alter-hepatitis-b-vaccine-guidance-fbc1e421?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20committee%20heard,track%20infected%20mothers."&gt;&lt;u&gt;heard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presentations from several vaccine critics; no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subject-matter experts presented to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back up: &lt;/strong&gt;ACIP develops recommendations for the CDC on safe vaccine use and the U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules. The committee’s recommendations also impact which vaccines are covered by insurers and federal health programs. In June, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.readtangle.com/rfk-fires-vaccine-panel-cdc-acip/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all 17 committee members, claiming that they were not capable of independently evaluating the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Kennedy has since &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4zyp26xn2o?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appointed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; new members to ACIP, many of whom have criticized vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is a virus that can cause liver infection and lead to severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death. Prior to Friday’s vote, the CDC had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/health/kennedy-vaccine-committee-vote-hepatitisb.html?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20C.D.C.%20has,like%20diphtheria%2C%20tetanus%20and%20polio."&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for over three decades that infants receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours to newborns with infected mothers and within 24 hours to all other newborns. Doctors and public health experts have widely credited the vaccine with curbing the virus’s prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP members who supported the change said that the risk of newborns contracting the virus if their mothers test negative is very low and called for more substantive studies to determine whether the vaccine is safe for newborns, though past studies have found that it is safe. Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, the acting director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cdc-panel-remade-by-rfk-jr-votes-to-alter-hepatitis-b-vaccine-guidance-fbc1e421?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20newly%20appointed,track%20infected%20mothers."&gt;&lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that children should not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many medical groups, doctors and public health experts criticized the vote, saying that ACIP has become ideologically driven under Secretary Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned as the CDC’s chief medical officer in August, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/health/kennedy-vaccine-committee-vote-hepatitisb.html?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=Dr.%20Debra%20Houry,Dr.%20Houry%20said."&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; she was “very concerned” about the future of the agency under Kennedy, calling it “heartbreaking to see this science-driven agency turn into an ideological machine.” Others warned that the recommendation change will lead to an uptick in hepatitis B. Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill will &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20acting%20director%20of%20the%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention%2C%20Jim%20O%E2%80%99Neill%2C%20is%20expected%20to%20decide%20later%20whether%20to%20accept%20the%20committee%E2%80%99s%20recommendation."&gt;&lt;u&gt;decide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a later date whether to accept ACIP’s new guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115669821715563033?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;praised&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s new guidance, calling it “a very good decision.” He also announced that he had signed a presidential memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a review of childhood vaccine schedules in other countries and “better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule, so it is finally rooted in the Gold Standard of Science and COMMON SENSE!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll survey arguments from the left, right, and subject-matter experts about ACIP’s vote, followed by Executive Editor Isaac Saul’s take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-the-left-is-saying"&gt;What the left is saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The left criticizes the committee’s decision, saying it has no medical justification.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say Kennedy is accomplishing his anti-vaccine goals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Washington Post, Leana S. Wen said &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/05/hepatitis-b-cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendation/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“the CDC’s change to hepatitis B vaccination is even worse than it seems.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the bright side, the policy doesn’t change care for the babies at highest risk: Infants born to mothers known to have hepatitis B will still receive the vaccine, along with a preventive immunoglobulin, to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. And families who want their newborns to receive the hepatitis B shot can still choose it and have it be covered by insurance,” Wen wrote. “But this new approach attempts to solve an issue that doesn’t exist. There is no evidence that the birth dose is unsafe, and no evidence that waiting until two months offers any advantage to safety or efficacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plus, transmission doesn’t just happen mother-to-baby. Hepatitis B can spread through casual contact, including shared household items, small amounts of blood or saliva on toys and surfaces. Everyday interactions such as sharing spoons or cups, handling a baby with microscopic cuts on one’s hands or even inadvertently mixing up toothbrushes can be enough to transmit the virus,” Wen said. “Universal newborn vaccination has helped drive childhood hepatitis B infections down from 18,000 cases in 1991 to just about 20. Why change a policy that has been so effective?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn wrote &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-rfk-wins-acip-cdc-advisory-committee-hepatitis-vaccine?publication_id=87281&amp;amp;post_id=180991961&amp;amp;isFreemail=false&amp;amp;r=lpaxu&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;amp;ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“this is what it looks like when RFK Jr. wins.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exactly how (or when) the new hepatitis B vaccine guidelines would change actual behavior is difficult to say. It’s not as if anybody forces parents to get their kids vaccinated today, the proof being that some parents decline the hepatitis B shot for their kids already,” Cohn said. “But there’s a reason both supporters and critics of vaccines fight about these guidelines: They really do affect decision-making. They signal to parents what top scientists believe is the smartest course of action. And they can influence physicians, who look to bodies like the CDC to undertake the kind of ongoing, exhaustive literature and research reviews they don’t personally have time to do on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy has gone well beyond recruiting some contrarians with novel perspectives. He has populated the advisory committee almost exclusively with people with records of attacking vaccines in one way or another,” Cohn wrote. “The best-case scenario is that the health system’s collective muscle memory on hepatitis B is strong enough to keep current practices going… But in a highly politicized environment where the president and the nation’s top health care officials are constantly talking down vaccines, some people are bound to take their word seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-the-right-is-saying"&gt;What the right is saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the right say the change simply aligns the U.S. with other countries. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say the value of the CDC acting as a vaccine authority is limited. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Daily Caller, Emily Kopp said ACIP’s decision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/05/acip-childhood-vaccines-hepatitis-b/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“align[s] childhood vaccination schedule with other high-income nations.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pivot away from a universal shot within hours of birth aligns the U.S. policy with the approach of 24 other high-income nations that recommend a first dose at two months old or three months old,” Kopp wrote. “Though the American Hepatitis B vaccine schedule now resembles those of other Western nations, and despite the continued availability of the vaccine to all mothers, the legacy media characterized the decision as a reckless upheaval. ‘CDC panel makes most sweeping revision to child vaccine schedule under RFK Jr.,’ a Washington Post headline blares.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of the committee members agreed that the committee lacks key data on the risks and benefits. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not require randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of the two Hepatitis B vaccines that it approved for the first day of life in the 1980s, according to FDA Acting Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Tracy Beth Høeg,” Kopp said. “‘The data that we used to approve the Hepatitis B vaccines … were based on studies that had a very short-term follow-up and no control group,’ said Høeg… [She] identified anaphylaxis and fever as rare side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Cato, Jeffrey A. Singer wrote about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/why-medical-guidance-shouldnt-come-washington?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“why medical guidance shouldn’t come from Washington.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many professional medical and public health organizations oppose the decision, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the American Pharmacists Association, as well as numerous clinical researchers and medical specialists,” Singer said. “This episode highlights a deeper institutional problem. As I have written previously, ‘Members of the medical and scientific community who have long supported an active government role in health issues likely never expected that a controversial figure like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr… would become the leader of the country’s public health system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores why… Congress should return the CDC to its original purpose: being a focused partner that assists states in tracking and controlling infectious diseases. The federal government should leave medical and scientific debates to scientists and clinicians. By involving itself in these debates, the CDC fosters the impression that there is a single ‘right answer’ to complex, nuanced questions,” Singer wrote. “If there’s a silver lining, it’s that controversies like this may finally encourage clinicians, researchers, and patients to rely less on federal pronouncements and more on diverse, independent medical expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-medical-professionals-are-saying"&gt;What medical professionals are saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical professionals uniformly criticize the change in guidance, saying it has no scientific basis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others suggest the change will put an undue burden on parents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Association of Immunologists said they were &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/12/05/acip-recommendation-first-dose-hepb-vaccine/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“extremely disappointed”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in the recommendation change. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The science behind the hepatitis B vaccine is robust and well-established. The hepatitis B vaccine has an exceptional safety record, and it is extremely effective at preventing lifelong, chronic infection in infants who might otherwise be exposed to the virus during childbirth or early life,” the group wrote. “More than 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B at or around birth will go on to develop chronic hepatitis B. Of those, roughly one in four face a premature death from liver disease or liver cancer. The impact this has on families, and the healthcare system, can be effectively mitigated with use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Delaying the vaccine would mark a dangerous departure from decades of achievement in preventing hepatitis B infection and its complications. Recent independent analysis warns that even a modest delay could result in a substantial increase in preventable chronic infections, liver cancers, and deaths. Now is not the time to undermine confidence in one of the most successful vaccine-based public health interventions in modern history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Your Local Epidemiologist, Katelyn Jetelina shared her &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/acip-key-takeaways-what-really-happened?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“key takeaways”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; from the vote. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the end, the committee voted to move America back to pre-1991 by removing the universal vaccination recommendation for the Hepatitis B infant dose despite no new evidence of harm and ignoring clear benefits. They also recommended that parents ask clinicians for an antibody blood test to determine the need for subsequent doses, even though there’s no evidence that this works,” Jetelina said. “This ultimately shifts the burden to clinicians and parents and abdicates the responsibility of the recommending body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where this goes from here depends on what happens next. If confusion dominates headlines and clinical practice and falsehoods fill the void, the consequences will be serious. But if we respond the way we saw many do today — pushing back with clarity, authority, evidence, coordination, and grassroots strength — the harm can be contained and minimized,” Jetelina wrote. “Unfortunately, our work is not done. There will be increasing confusion about evidence-based vaccination options for parents, clinicians, hospital systems, and schools. This will decrease vaccination coverage, leading to more disease and unnecessary suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="my-take"&gt;My take.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: “My take” is a section where we give ourselves space to share a personal opinion.

Even for a professional information consumer like me, separating fact from fiction is a scary and fraught process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is intensified by the &lt;em&gt;actual experience &lt;/em&gt;of vaccinating: holding an infant child down on a table while they get pricked and prodded, them crying in pain and then (often) experiencing a day or two of fussiness and fever. &lt;em&gt;Are they okay? What have I done? Was this really worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you are reading a politics newsletter right now, I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to give you or your children medical advice. Instead, I will speak to my own experience, and how some vaccination decisions for children feel less obvious than others. Getting a Covid vaccine for an infant, for instance, did not seem straightforward. Unlike with other vaccines, our doctor was much less forceful in her opinion about what we should do. Covid vaccines are new and less tested for infants, and Covid is often less dangerous for young children. My wife had Covid while she was pregnant, and our baby breast fed (so he was, theoretically, getting antibodies from her, since she was vaccinated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; had the virus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before our son arrived, my wife and I decided on a process for making these decisions: We were going to pick one or two trusted sources &lt;em&gt;outside of our medical team, &lt;/em&gt;and use the information from our doctors combined with those sources to make informed decisions. That way, we could try to ignore the firehose of information we encounter every time we open a social media app or turn on the news. For us, the source we leaned on most heavily was Emily Oster, the professional economist behind the best-seller &lt;em&gt;Expecting Better&lt;/em&gt; and the parenting website &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parent Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who makes decisions through a data-first framework. Her educated opinion felt like a nice complement to the medical advice from our doctors, and she provided a trustworthy single source for the unavoidable questions that pop up during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be candid: My wife and I didn’t seriously consider skipping the hepatitis B vaccine when our son was born. We had decided to lean on the wisdom of my wife’s doctor and Oster, who both said the decision carried close to zero risk and offered only upside. We might have had one drawn out discussion after our doula told us we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pass on the vaccine when my wife tested negative for the virus, but we didn’t see any compelling reason to question the advice of our medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is the lens through which I’ve been watching this story unfold. Even though I’m not personally someone who would trust a government guideline above all else, I do think agencies like the CDC must present reliable, clear information for parents navigating these difficult decisions. Unfortunately, after picking new members for ACIP to ensure vaccine-skeptical outcomes like this, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is offering parents like me only more doubt and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the effects of the new panel’s first major decision, I turned to two public health commentators whose insight I trust: Dr. Leana S. Wen, an open-minded public health expert (who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/fluoride-water-kennedy-rfk-brain-development/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;backed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy’s push to remove fluoride from water), and Katelyn Jetelina (the epidemiologist behind &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your Local Epidemiologist&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Both were alarmed. Jetelina emphasized that the outcome is not as bad as some headlines make it seem, given that the vaccine will still be widely available and eligible for insurance coverage, yet her trepidation came through. She offered a worried but &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/acip-key-takeaways-what-really-happened?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;optimistic take&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how public pressure and a few determined ACIP members were able to push back on the flimsiness of some of the claims presented to the committee and prevent a far worse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wen instead &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/05/hepatitis-b-cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendation/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;focused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mostly on the practical effects of the new guideline outcome: That parents will now be asked to test antibody levels in their children after the first of the vaccine’s three-dose series. After our two-day stay in the hospital after our son was born, we had a one-month check-up, a three-month check-up, and a six-month check-up. Paired with a couple of visits for a rash here or a fever there and various follow-ups with individual specialists, parents of even a healthy baby already end up going to the doctor eight or 10 times in the first ten months. Adding another infant blood draw, another doctor’s appointment, and more cost to the already overwhelming early infancy is — to me — pretty preposterous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I found the counterpoints to this view unconvincing. Some writers claimed the vaccine addresses a non-existent risk. The blogger streiff &lt;a href="https://redstate.com/streiff/2025/12/05/cdcs-vaccine-committee-reverses-decades-long-infant-vaccination-requirement-and-subservience-to-pharma-n2196864?ref=readtangle.com#google_vignette"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Every expectant mother is tested for the virus when she is admitted for delivery and, if she is positive, the infant can be vaccinated then.” This simply isn’t true. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/diagnosis-testing/index.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommends testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the first trimester, not at delivery, and many mothers (including my wife) are only tested for hepatitis early on in pregnancy. That test is &lt;em&gt;consulted&lt;/em&gt; during delivery — but a new test is often not administered if the mother was negative. That means new mothers could have become carriers for the virus and without knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commentators have also emphasized that this new guidance brings us in line with many other peer nations. But those nations are not really our peers when it comes to healthcare or population. Denmark, for instance, has universal healthcare, more consistent prenatal care, and perhaps most importantly, a smaller and much less diverse population than us (with a &lt;a href="https://en.ssi.dk/surveillance-and-preparedness/surveillance-in-denmark/annual-reports-on-disease-incidence/h/hepatitis-b-2023---acute-and-chronic?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lower incidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B). Our healthcare systems and populations are different enough that I think looking to Denmark for guidance is a self-defeating task. We should do what works for us, not for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again: I’ll re-emphasize that my perspective is not expert, and that a variety of expert viewpoints is &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;for new parents. Secretary Kennedy often promotes a similar message. But the actions of the department he leads actually shut down genuine scientific exchange of ideas, which to me is the most frightening aspect of ACIP’s decision. For their latest meeting, Kennedy broke from tradition by refusing to allow presentations from CDC subject-matter experts. So while scientists who study the hepatitis B vaccine for a living were shut out from deliberations, a lawyer and longtime Kennedy ally named Aaron Siri (who has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;petitioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government to stop distributing the polio vaccine!) was able to state his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is decidedly &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;scientific debate; it’s working towards a desired outcome. And while this particular outcome isn’t the worst-case scenario, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another worrying step for Kennedy’s Health Department — and it will have real practical implications for parents and infants who are unlucky enough to encounter hepatitis B in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the survey: &lt;/strong&gt;How does the latest change affect your trust in CDC vaccine recommendations? &lt;a href="https://interrobang.vercel.app/survey/72c2c5e8-616a-4af7-b356-736974543d50?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Let us know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disagree?

Is that renaming official? If so, why does Tangle not use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Adam from Denver, CO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tangle: &lt;/strong&gt;In a sense, he’s both — and no, the rename is not official. In the White House’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-the-united-states-department-of-war/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;September 5 fact sheet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announcing the Trump Administration’s restoration of the name “Department of War,” the title is officially stated to be “secondary.” A secondary title is one that agencies can use to refer to themselves in official government communications and often matches their already utilized informal names, and are usually inversions (like &lt;em&gt;Justice Department&lt;/em&gt; instead of Department of Justice) and are often abbreviations (like &lt;em&gt;DOE&lt;/em&gt; for Department of Energy). Only Congress has the authority to officially rename a federal department or agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tangle, we have a policy of using the official name of the department as a default, but we often use informal titles so our reporting sounds more natural and less repetitive. For example, we might occasionally refer to the Department of Defense as &lt;em&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/em&gt; (the department’s headquarters), and we could refer to the Central Intelligence Agency as &lt;em&gt;Langley &lt;/em&gt;(the Virginia city where the CIA is headquartered). But when it comes to a &lt;em&gt;person’s&lt;/em&gt; title, we’re always going to use the official name; that means we’re not going to write &lt;em&gt;Secretary of War,&lt;/em&gt; just as we’d never write &lt;em&gt;Secretary of the Pentagon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s broaden the scope and ask a tougher question: Would Tangle ever write the Department of War? Maybe, but it’s trickier for us to adopt. First, informal names are often determined by popular usage, not top-down dictum, so we’re resistant to follow a government order to change a title we’ve been using without issue all our lives. Second, the Department of Defense has &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/articles/department-of-war-defense-name-changes?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a history behind its name&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of War that existed from 1789–1947 is actually not the exact same as the modern DoD. At first, that agency only oversaw the Army, while the Navy had its own cabinet-level department. President Truman consolidated the departments, along with the new Air Force, under the “National Military Establishment” in 1947 — then he restructured them again into the “Department of Defense” in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also emphasized the military’s use as a deterrent and deemphasized “war” as a cabinet-level pursuit for our government, so bringing back the older title seems like a step in the other direction. Maybe we’ll write it occasionally, but it’s not a title we’re eager to employ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to have a question answered in the newsletter?

The company had planned to continue reducing operations at the plant before the Trump administration intervened to block the move in September; U.S. Steel now says that demand for steel has risen enough to warrant a restart in production, particularly as the company completes renovations at other steel mills. “We are confident in our ability to safely and profitably operate the mill to meet 2026 demand,” U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-steel-to-restart-blast-furnace-at-plant-trump-pushed-to-preserve-839fba2f?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Wall Street Journal has the story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

1,915 readers responded to our survey on the special election in Tennessee with 44% saying the results provide a slightly better signal for Democrats than Republicans. “If the Democrats can’t pick more palatable candidates, it won’t matter that there's fairly widespread discontent for the current Republicans,” one respondent said. “I don't put too much stock in off-cycle special elections held in the middle of the holiday season,” said another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 600w, https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 1000w, https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="have-a-nice-day"&gt;Have a nice day.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40% of families in the Standing Rock Reservation live below the poverty line. Tribal-owned energy group SAGE had an idea for an initiative to return investment: promoting electric vehicle access in the rural community where gas prices significantly raise the cost of living. Through a regional initiative called “Electric Nation,” SAGE spent three years installing EV chargers along the border of North and South Dakota, and the project wrapped at the end of November. “Even though tribes have been skipped over and underfunded, they’ve become a keystone to filling in infrastructure gaps in rural America,” Len Necefer, a Navajo citizen and energy expert, said. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/climate/electic-vehicle-chargers-north-dakota.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times has the story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

After a bevy of tests, they found that KJ has an ultra-rare genetic condition, called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, that impairs the body’s ability to process protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body breaks down proteins, it produces ammonia — a toxic substance that is usually processed by enzymes in the liver and excreted in urine. CPS1 deficiency compromises one of these enzymes, causing ammonia to accumulate in the blood, which can eventually damage the brain. The condition can be treated with a liver transplant, but about half of all babies with CPS1 deficiency die in early infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of KJ’s doctors, paediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, wondered whether there might be another solution — correcting the faulty enzyme in his liver. She and Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had a bold plan to treat children with rare genetic disorders using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapies tailored to unique DNA sequences&lt;/a&gt;. KJ could be their first candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous gene-editing therapies were designed to treat many people. The first approved CRISPR therapy, called Casgevy, could potentially treat tens of thousands of people with one of two blood disorders. By contrast, KJ’s therapy would work only for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used an offshoot of CRISPR genome editing, called base editing, to target the problematic mutation — one faulty DNA letter out of the three billion in the human genome — and correct it (&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;K. Musunuru &lt;i&gt;et al. N. Engl. J. Med. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;392&lt;/b&gt;, 2235–2243; 2025&lt;/a&gt;). Such a hyper-personalized editing therapy had never been made so quickly; KJ might only have a few months before ammonia overwhelmed his small body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it took a large team of researchers in academia and industry to make it happen. While KJ charmed everyone he met at the hospital, Musunuru and his lab members shielded themselves from learning any personal details about him, even his name. “There were certain go or no-go points where key decisions had to be made,” Musunuru says. “We had to be objective with respect to the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing companies worked around the clock to make the gene-editing components needed to treat KJ. “We estimated that it would take 18 months,” says Sandy Ottensmann, a vice-president at Integrated DNA Technologies in Coralville, Iowa. “We did it in six.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 25 February, KJ received the first of three infusions. His tolerance for protein in his diet has increased, but he still needs medication and regular monitoring to ensure that his ammonia levels stay in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But here was powerful validation that the window for treating the rare, hereditary condition remains open — offering a chance for meaningful, disease-modifying interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-infographic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a giant step forward,” says Tabrizi, who was the trial’s lead scientific adviser. “The dial has been shifted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-in-class gene therapy — called AMT-130 and developed by uniQure, a biotechnology company in Amsterdam — uses a harmless virus to deliver strands of genetic material into affected brain regions. Once there, the therapy switches off production of the faulty mutant huntingtin protein that slowly destroys brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical data set was small, involving just 12 people who received a high dose of the therapy. And the treatment is invasive, requiring lengthy brain surgery. But &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track="click" data-label="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track="click" data-label="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;he results were striking&lt;/a&gt;. On a standard rating scale used to assesses motor and cognitive functions and other measures of daily living, the scores of participants receiving the high dose dropped by just 0.38 points over three years. That’s compared with a reduction of 1.52 points for people in a control group, meaning that the treatment slowed the rate of decline by 75%. That clinical benefit was reinforced by molecular validation: spinal-fluid levels of a protein linked to dying brain cells had gone down in the treatment recipients, the opposite of what typically occurs as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After digesting the findings, Tabrizi and her close collaborator Ed Wild, a fellow neurologist at University College London, shared what Wild describes as a “massive hug”. But, after that, it was right back to the daily demands of patient care and research. “We’ll celebrate very unreservedly — but briefly,” Wild says. “We’re like an episode of &lt;i&gt;The West Wing&lt;/i&gt;: it’s always, ‘What’s next?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next for Tabrizi and Wild are leading roles in evaluating five other huntingtin-lowering therapies in clinical development, along with several others poised to enter human trials soon. Tabrizi is also spearheading laboratory studies into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration — work that could yield many other drug candidates in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sarah is amazing,” says Hugh Rickards, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “She’s the spider in the middle of the web. You name a disease-modifying therapy in HD — she’s got her hand on it somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, “she’s one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet”, says Samuel Frank, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who, like Rickards, has worked with Tabrizi on Huntington’s trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing a part in nearly every important clinical advance means that she also carries the scars of the field’s most agonizing disappointments. Only four years ago, another &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;romising huntingtin-targeted therapy&lt;/a&gt;, tominersen, faltered in late-stage trials. Overall, the drug failed to improve people’s outcomes compared with those of the control group and it came with dangerous side effects at higher doses. As principal investigator of the nearly 800-person study, the unenviable task of explaining the results to participating families fell to Tabrizi. “It was heartbreaking,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalls her message to the distraught community: “Trials are scientific experiments,” she says. “Through failure, as painful as it is, is often how you learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” said Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman. “It was very clear that there was no help coming … Thanks to Channel 9, you guys reached out to ODNR, and amazingly, they started to change their tune.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff and teachers at St. Bernadette’s School on Locust Lake Road returned from Thanksgiving break on Dec. 1 and found dead vultures spread across a campus where more than 200 children are enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school contacted Pierce Township Fire Chief Craig Wright for help, who said he reached out to ODNR for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(ODNR wasn't) overly concerned with the situation. They really had no intention to come out and do anything for the problem,” Wright said. “It did upset me. I was a little surprised. It’s a wildlife issue. There's no better agency than them to deal with a wildlife issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, Wright said he contacted local public health and emergency management agencies for help to come up with a contingency plan, while the dead birds remained at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big undertaking to clean up this many dead animals when you really don’t know or have the education or expertise to deal with that issue,” Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ODNR spokesperson said the agency does not typically collect dead wildlife, but decided to help “for this unique circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) has conducted testing of other dead wild birds in Clermont County, and we have been advised that those other birds are ‘presumed positive’ for HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) … once a presumed positive case is identified in a county, all additional dead birds found in groups of six or more are also presumed to be HPAI and are treated as such. Therefore, the vultures in this case are presumed to be positive for HPAI, however, ODNR is working to collect additional samples to send for testing due to this unique circumstance,” according to a statement from ODNR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-1"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman said he wants to know for certain if the vultures died from bird flu or were poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman and Wright both said that ODNR declined to test the birds. A spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health confirmed the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As is protocol in situations involving wildlife, the issue was originally reported to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which declined to test the birds,” according to a statement from public health spokesperson Krista Rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, given the potential risk to public health, we worked with our state partners to arrange testing. … On Friday, Dec. 5, two birds are being delivered to a state animal laboratory for testing. We expect results back early next week,” Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, dozens of seemingly healthy black vultures flew around the school on Friday morning. They perched in trees and on the baseball field fence near the carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman said he worries about more bird deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You also have a lot of geese that are in this area as well. So, all of those are flock animals, and they can be spreading this to countless areas inside Clermont County … and we would have no idea,” Freeman said. “There are a number of people very close by that have cattle operations, and it has been known that bird flu can jump to cattle … it starts to open up an entirely new avenue that deals with our food and our food supply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wright urged residents not to panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know why the birds have died. There's an assumption that it could be a bird flu, but they’ve not been tested to confirm that,” Wright said. “I’ve been assured by health officials that it’s a really low risk of transmission to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the testing comes back positive for bird flu, the current risk to the public is very low, Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transmission occurs through contact with respiratory droplets and bodily fluids from live birds. Transmission of bird flu in wildlife can increase in the spring and fall with bird migration. The current strain of H5N1 has been found in the wild and domestic bird populations since 2022 throughout the country, including Ohio,” Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-2"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierce Township residents who find dead birds are urged to contact the township fire department or the Ohio Department of Natural Resources at &lt;a href="tel:8009453543" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;(800) 945-3543&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:wildinfo@dnr.ohio.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wildinfo@dnr.ohio.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was provided to CNN Wire by an affiliate and does not contain original CNN reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

It’s a trend that experts worry could have deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32f367" class="body-graf"&gt;Babies are born with very low levels of vitamin K, a nutrient the body needs for blood to clot, leaving them at risk for severe bleeding early in life. In the early 1960s, hospitals in the United States began giving newborns shots of the vitamin within the first six hours of birth to prevent bleeding, including bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc2a87" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the leader of the study, said he and his co-authors noticed &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/vitamin-k-shot-hesitancy-babies-rcna57476" target="_blank"&gt;a rise in parents turning down the shot&lt;/a&gt; in their own practices, prompting the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dd84e" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Scott said, he wasn’t fully expecting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ffa1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The increase is not surprising, but the degree to which it did increase did catch me off guard,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de157f" class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed electronic medical record data from Epic Systems’ Cosmos database, which included whether an infant received a vitamin K shot. The study included more than 5 million babies born in 403 hospitals in all 50 states, from 2017 through 2024. The researchers found that about 4% of babies — about 200,000 — born in this time frame didn’t get vitamin K shots. The percentage rose from less than 3% in 2017 to more than 5% in 2024. The trend was highest among non-Hispanic white babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7585d5" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate really started increasing from 2019 to 2020, and accelerated during and after the Covid pandemic, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d379bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Scott said there haven’t been any large policy changes regarding vitamin K shots from hospitals, nor changes in recommendations from medical organizations. That means the rise in babies not getting vitamin K shots is almost certainly due to parental refusal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ddb54" class="body-graf"&gt;Reports of a trend go back before 2017. A 2016 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/6/1/15/26290/Reasons-for-Refusal-of-Newborn-Vitamin-K" target="_blank"&gt;Hospital Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; looked at why parents refuse the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739bf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Widespread misinformation on social media and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/life-changing-impact-diseases-anti-vaccination-era-rcna215968" target="_blank"&gt;rising vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt; are likely contributing to an uptick in the number of parents refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, said Dr. Tiffany McKee-Garrett, an associate professor of pediatrics at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-338a45" class="body-graf"&gt;“Parents are equating vitamin K injections to vaccines,” McKee-Garrett said, adding that a vitamin K shot is not a vaccine, but a supplement derived from a plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-297bbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ivan Hand, director of neonatology at NYC Health + Hospitals Kings County in Brooklyn, has also noticed the trend in his practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44bb6f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think this comes from general mistrust in authority that started probably in the later part of the 2010s,” said Hand, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f521d6" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2022, Hand co-authored an &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/3/e2021056036/184866/Vitamin-K-and-the-Newborn-Infant" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement&lt;/a&gt; on parents refusing vitamin K shots for newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64eef1" class="body-graf"&gt;Newborns who don’t get a vitamin K shot are more than 80 times more likely to have bleeding from vitamin K deficiency than those who get the shot, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Bleeding can happen up to six months after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-713eaf" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are creating a population of newborns who are at risk of bleeding,” Scott said, adding that this could include anything from bruising, to losing blood when the umbilical cord is cut, to gastrointestinal bleeding. “Bleeding into the brain is what we really worry about, essentially a stroke,” he said. “That can ultimately cause death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fc4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the drop in the number of infants getting the shot that doctors are seeing correlates to a rise in the number of cases of bleeding from vitamin K deficiency in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-421055" class="body-graf"&gt;Hand said he has not seen an increase in his practice, but added that he only sees infants just after they are born. Scott said he believes further research will find an increase in bleeding events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f77675" class="body-graf"&gt;“We know unequivocally that when infants do not receive vitamin K, they are at increased risk of bleeding,” he said, adding that at CHOP, there has not only been an increase in vitamin K refusal, but also an increase in bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38255a" class="body-graf"&gt;In Houston, McKee-Garrett has heard reports of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, something that was extremely rare for decades after the U.S. began widely giving vitamin K shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb9e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a preventable disease, so we shouldn’t be seeing it at all,” Hand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-494c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;In some countries, babies are given oral doses of vitamin K supplements. However, these &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8424792/" target="_blank"&gt;formulas can be inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; and each baby’s digestive system absorbs different amounts of the nutrient, Hand said, adding that breast milk is also not a good enough source of vitamin K to prevent deficiency. Oral vitamin K supplements also need to be given multiple times, whereas the vitamin shots only need to be given once. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862383/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Europe have also shown that while oral vitamin K supplementation may be effective in the first week of life, it may be much less effective at preventing late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can occur up to 6 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad663e" class="body-graf"&gt;“That late-onset bleeding, the bleeding that occurs internally, has a 20% mortality rate,” McKee-Garrett said. Some studies have found it to be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929546/" target="_blank"&gt;as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e451" class="body-graf"&gt;Because vitamin K shots have been widely given in the U.S. for more than 60 years, Hand said parents may not understand the risk of forgoing the prophylactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2d087" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These treatments have been so effective that people don’t understand the consequences. They have never seen babies with severe bleeding, so they think it doesn’t exist,” he said. “But you don’t see it because we are treating these kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQcEZSMEwxbHNsQjNzQklmY0JNT3JLTzRHMm9hdkhidzZtTzdzQW5nc1RPRWNGbTF6cko3VUpjRFdIQ1haSUhVZnNnbG81TUJBZDJYSkVaVEc5WTdJVVNOSVpra3lZSGVMMVZ5bnF3RGszZ3FXcmcydFp6dkE1MWQ3aFoyNnVPdk96RnhtUlNXY3BaV0huRl8zZGt2WHdDSENaU01tejZ4QUp3UjTSAVZBVV95cUxOcGZQZ09GT3NJNXpOa0wwZkhVS1NTREZ2Sko5b0FSSUpnUkY4U05BOVJtaXpsdnRNTENtMXZHMlVISUJTcVpGS1lJVWRSVkl6dHVHNUxUQQ</guid></item><item><title>肠道分子显示出非凡的抗糖尿病能力- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052518.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;An international group of scientists led by Professor Marc-Emmanuel Dumas at Imperial College London &amp;amp; CNRS, along with Prof. Patrice Cani (Imperial &amp;amp; University of Louvain, UCLouvain), Dr. Dominique Gauguier (Imperial &amp;amp; INSERM, Paris) and Prof. Peter Liu (University of Ottawa Heart Institute), has identified an unexpected natural compound that helps counter insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The compound, trimethylamine (TMA), is a metabolite created by gut microbes from dietary choline. According to a study in Nature Metabolism, TMA can interrupt a key immune pathway and contribute to healthier blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery builds on work that began 20 years ago. During his postdoctoral research, Patrice Cani found that high-fat diets allow bacterial components to pass into the body, prompting the immune system to activate and ignite inflammation. This immune response was shown to play a direct role in insulin resistance among people with diabetes. Although this idea faced skepticism in 2005, it is now widely recognized and scientifically accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, researchers at the University of Louvain and Imperial College London clarified how this harmful chain reaction might be counteracted. They reported that TMA, formed by gut microbes from dietary choline present in several foods, can support improved blood-sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMA Blocks a Critical Immune Protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key lies in the molecule's interaction with IRAK4, a protein that helps regulate immune activity. Under a high-fat diet, IRAK4 responds by triggering inflammation to signal that the body is experiencing dietary imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the body is exposed to elevated fat intake for extended periods (as in type 2 diabetes), IRAK4 becomes overstimulated. This constant activation drives chronic inflammation, which contributes directly to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of human cell cultures, animal studies, and molecular screening tools, the research team demonstrated that TMA can attach to IRAK4 and reduce its activity. This interaction lowers inflammation caused by fatty foods and restores the body's ability to respond to insulin. The findings suggest that TMA may help recalibrate harmful metabolic responses triggered by poor dietary habits. The molecule also showed an impressive ability to protect mice from sepsis-related death by weakening overwhelming inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRAK4 Targeting Offers New Therapeutic Possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments confirmed that removing the IRAK4 gene or inhibiting it with drugs produced the same beneficial effects seen with TMA. Because IRAK4 is already a well-established target in drug development, the results point toward promising treatment strategies for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This flips the narrative," said Prof. Dumas. "We've shown that a molecule from our gut microbes can actually protect against the harmful effects of a poor diet through a new mechanism. It's a new way of thinking about how the microbiome influences our health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This shows how nutrition and our gut microbes can work together by producing molecules that fight inflammation and improve metabolic health!" said Prof. Patrice Cani, co-senior author, University of Louvain, Belgium and visiting professor at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Impact and Future Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 500 million people worldwide living with diabetes, the identification of TMA as a microbial signal that shapes immune responses introduces a potential new avenue for treatment. Approaches that enhance TMA production, whether through diet or medication, could help reduce insulin resistance and improve long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we eat shapes our microbes and some of their molecules can protect us from diabetes. That's nutrition in action!" said University of Louvain, Prof. Cani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by an extensive network of collaborators across Europe and North America, involving teams in Belgium, Canada, Australia, France, Italy, and Spain. Funding came from numerous European (ERC, FEDER) and national (MRC, Wellcome Trust, ANR, FNRS, EOS, WELRi, ARC) sources, highlighting the large-scale effort behind this breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good night’s sleep is more than a luxury: New research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests that insufficient sleep may shorten your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sleepadvances/zpaf090/8373869" rel="" target="_blank" title=""&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;SLEEP Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers tapped a vast, nationwide database looking for survey trends associated with average life expectancy county by county. They compared county-level data about average life expectancy with comprehensive survey data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2019 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a behavioral driver for life expectancy, sleep stood out more than diet, more than exercise, more than loneliness — indeed, more than any other factor except smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="textImage textImage-caption textImage-right"&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Andrew McHill, Ph.D., has short brown hair, a dress shirt and tie, smiling in a garden area." author="" class="widget-image" custom_size="false" data-imgheight="120" data-imgwidth="120" file_id="65d00dd33d6332880387c384" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/296/files/20241/65d00dd33d6332880387c384_Andrew+McHill/Andrew+McHill_s.jpg" title="Andrew McHill, Ph.D. (OHSU)"&gt;
&lt;p class="textImage-captionBody"&gt;Andrew McHill, Ph.D. (OHSU)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect it to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy,” said senior author &lt;strong&gt;Andrew McHill, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, associate professor in the OHSU School of Nursing, the OHSU School of Medicine and OHSU’s Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences. “We’ve always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: People really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted primarily by graduate students in the Sleep, Chronobiology and Health Laboratory of the OHSU School of Nursing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have broadly understood the importance of sufficient sleep for a variety of positive health outcomes. However, McHill and co-authors said they were surprised by the strength of the connection to life expectancy. The effect of insufficient sleep swamped the impact of diet and exercise as a predictor of life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s intuitive and makes a lot of sense, but it was still striking to see it materialize so strongly in all of these models,” McHill said. “I’m a sleep physiologist who understands the health benefits of sleep, but the strength of the association between sleep sufficiency and life expectancy was remarkable to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has shown broadly that lack of adequate sleep leads to higher mortality risk, the new research is the first to reveal year-to-year correlations between sleep and life expectancy for every U.S. state. For the purpose of modeling, the CDC defined sufficient sleep as at least seven hours a night, which is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found clear correlations in each year and in most U.S. states between sleep and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis did not delve into reasons why inadequate sleep appears to shorten life expectancy, but McHill noted that sleep influences cardiovascular health, the immune system and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as we do to what we eat or how we exercise,” he said. “Sometimes, we think of sleep as something we can set aside and maybe put off until later or on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Getting a good night’s sleep will improve how you feel but also how long you live.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to McHill, co-authors include lead author &lt;strong&gt;Kathryn E. McAuliffe, B.S.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Madeline R. Wary, B.S.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gemma V. Pleas, B.A.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kiziah E.S. Pugmire, B.S.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Courtney Lysiak, B.A.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nathan F. Dieckmann, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Brooke M. Shafer, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, under Award numbers R01HL156948, R01HL169317 and T32HL083808; the OHSU School of Nursing; and by the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences by way of funding from the Division of Consumer and Business Services of the state of Oregon (ORS 656.630).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/06/adhd-medication-drugs-risks-benefits-children-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; with symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Torkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMG11TmFRdjBYMWZlanc3ZFgyNFpzQ0U1NWlRMkIwdk1jQVQ5SFg0VDY0RXM4MkdPbXVZaU9SYTgyb2Y1em5uek9vUmdscURZWUZlUWw5bFc4a3p1QVlvWHBmelR1OXBRYmxuSVZFb19ZNmxITlU0RGwxc3dYOFVIUmRrVlhFd3RHWk05Y2Z5d05hbDJWR1dQdmdwN0xIelk</guid></item><item><title>裸盖菇素通过抑制特定的神经通路来帮助大脑消除恐惧- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/psilocybin-helps-the-brain-unlearn-fear-by-silencing-specific-neural-pathways/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01964-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides a detailed look at how the psychedelic drug psilocybin facilitates the unlearning of fear in the brain. The research reveals that the drug does not simply boost learning capabilities but specifically coordinates the suppression of neurons holding traumatic memories while recruiting new cells to encode safety. These changes in neural activity patterns were found to predict how successfully an individual could overcome a conditioned fear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychiatric conditions often trap patients in rigid patterns of thought and behavior. Disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety affect over a billion people globally. A defining feature of these conditions is behavioral inflexibility. This is the inability to adapt to new information, such as realizing a previously dangerous trigger is now safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is a compound naturally found in certain species of mushrooms. It has emerged as a potential treatment for these stubborn disorders. Clinical trials have shown that even a single dose can produce lasting improvements in mental health. Patients often report increased feelings of well-being and a greater ability to break out of negative thought loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising clinical results, the biological changes driving this flexibility remain partially understood. Researchers know that psilocybin activates specific serotonin receptors in the brain. This activation initiates a cascade of molecular events that promote neural plasticity, which is the brain’s ability to rewire itself. However, it has been unclear how these molecular changes translate into the editing of specific memories within neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers sought to bridge the gap between molecular signaling and behavioral change. The study was authored by Sophie A. Rogers, Elizabeth A. Heller, and Gregory Corder from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. They focused their investigation on the retrosplenial cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retrosplenial cortex is a brain region essential for memory and navigation. It helps the brain link past events with current contexts to guide future behavior. This area is particularly active when the brain must associate two events that are separated by a span of time. This function makes it a prime candidate for storing the types of complex fear memories that characterize human trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how psilocybin affects this region, the researchers employed a mouse model of fear learning. They used a technique called trace fear conditioning. In this protocol, mice hear a tone, followed by a twenty-second silence, and then receive a mild electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silence, or “trace period,” forces the brain to maintain a memory of the tone to associate it with the impending shock. This requires the active participation of the cortex. Once the mice learned this association, they displayed fear by freezing in place when they heard the tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then put the mice through an extinction process. This is similar to exposure therapy in humans. The mice were exposed to the tone and the waiting period repeatedly, but the shock was omitted. Over time, animals typically learn that the tone no longer signals danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes before the first extinction session, the researchers administered either a saline solution or a dose of psilocybin to the mice. They monitored the animals’ behavior over several days to see how well they retained the safety memory. To observe the brain during this process, the team used miniature microscopes implanted in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These devices allowed the scientists to perform longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging. This technology visualizes the activity of hundreds of individual neurons in the living brain. When a neuron fires, calcium floods the cell, which the microscope records as a flash of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking the same neurons over five days, the team could identify which cells were involved in different stages of the experiment. They used a computational analysis to group these neurons into “ensembles.” An ensemble is a team of neurons that fire together to represent a specific piece of information, such as the fear memory or the new safety memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavioral results showed significant variability among the subjects. Psilocybin did not universally cure fear in every animal. Instead, the population split into “responders” and “non-responders.” The researchers classified these as low-freezing and high-freezing groups based on their behavior days after the drug was administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the low-freezing group, the mice that received psilocybin extinguished their fear more effectively than the control group. They learned that the tone was safe and stopped freezing. This allowed the researchers to compare the brain activity of animals that successfully adapted with those that did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging data uncovered a distinct neural signature in the successful mice. During the initial formation of the fear memory, a specific group of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex became highly active. In mice that failed to overcome their fear, this “fear ensemble” remained active throughout the extinction sessions. The old memory trace persisted, drowning out new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different pattern emerged in the mice that responded well to psilocybin. In these animals, the drug appeared to cause a rapid and lasting suppression of the fear ensemble. The neurons associated with the traumatic event were silenced. This suppression was much stronger in the psilocybin group than in the saline control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, a new group of neurons began to fire. The researchers identified this as the “extinction ensemble.” These cells encoded the new information that the context was safe. The study found that the inhibition of the fear neurons was linked to the successful recruitment of these safety neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is described as bidirectional modulation. The drug did not simply excite the entire brain region. Instead, it turned down the volume on the maladaptive memory while turning up the volume on the adaptive one. The balance between these two populations of neurons predicted the animal’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that this remodeling happened rapidly. The suppression of the fear-active neurons occurred during the session when the drug was active. This suggests that the psychedelic state creates an opportunity for the brain to overwrite established patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify their interpretation, the team built a computational model of this neural circuit. They simulated two populations of neurons that inhibited each other. One represented the fear memory, and the other represented the extinction memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model showed that simply boosting the safety neurons was insufficient to explain the behavioral results. To replicate the rapid learning seen in the mice, the model required the active inhibition of the fear neurons. When the fear neurons were suppressed, the safety neurons were able to emerge and stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This computational finding aligns with the experimental data. It supports the idea that psilocybin facilitates flexibility by disrupting the dominance of entrenched neural patterns. This allows weaker, alternative pathways to gain strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also noted acute effects on behavior during the drug experience itself. Mice under the influence of psilocybin showed disrupted freezing patterns during the first extinction session. Their freezing bouts were shorter and more frequent. This suggests that the drug acutely interferes with the retrieval or expression of the fear memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed how the neurons encoded the act of freezing. In control mice, distinct patterns of neural activity separated moments of motion from moments of freezing. In psilocybin-treated mice, this distinction blurred. The neural representation of the behavior became less precise while the drug was active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this acute disruption was temporary. Two days later, the neural encoding of freezing returned and was even stronger in the animals that had learned effectively. This indicates that the temporary dismantling of neural structure may be a necessary step in rebuilding a more adaptive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this research. The study relied on freezing behavior as the primary metric for fear. It is possible that mice experience or express fear in ways that this specific measurement does not capture. Additionally, the variability in response suggests that biological differences between individuals influence the drug’s efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between responders and non-responders is significant. It indicates that psilocybin is not a magic bullet that works automatically for every subject. Understanding why some brains are primed to respond while others remain rigid is a necessary next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to investigate the molecular identity of the neurons involved. Identifying the specific markers on the fear-active neurons could help explain why they are susceptible to psilocybin-induced suppression. This could lead to more targeted pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also suggest that these findings might apply to other forms of rigid behavior. The mechanism of suppressing a dominant, maladaptive ensemble to allow a new behavior to emerge could be relevant for addiction or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The retrosplenial cortex is just one node in a larger network, and similar dynamics may play out elsewhere in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides a concrete neural mechanism for the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. It moves beyond general statements about plasticity to identify specific circuit-level changes. By dampening the noise of past trauma, psilocybin appears to open a window for the brain to learn that the world is safe again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01964-9" target="_blank"&gt;Psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction linked to bidirectional modulation of cortical ensembles&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sophie A.

The condition is often linked to factors such as low fiber intake, inadequate hydration, certain medications, and changes in routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New research highlights specific foods — prunes, kiwis, and rye bread — as particularly effective for improving stool consistency and supporting regularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gradually increasing fiber intake, staying well hydrated, and consistently adding these foods can ease symptoms, while supplements and laxatives may help when dietary changes aren’t sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Fiber is generally your digestive system’s friend, but recent &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jhn.70133" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kiwis-could-help-manage-chronic-constipation" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;King’s College London&lt;/a&gt; specifically found that regularly including kiwis, prunes, rye bread, and mineral-rich water in your diet may help alleviate chronic constipation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation is typically defined as having fewer than three bowel movements per week with stools that are hard, dry, or lumpy, and may be difficult or painful to pass, says &lt;a href="https://tcgids.com/ari-lamet-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ari Lamet&lt;/a&gt;, DO, a board-certified gastroenterologist at The Center For Gastrointestinal Disorders. “​​This generally happens when stool moves too slowly through the colon, which allows the large intestine to absorb too much water, leaving the stool hard and dry.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The cause of constipation depends on the circumstance, but according to &lt;a href="https://diningwithnature.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aderet Dana Hoch&lt;/a&gt;, RD, a registered dietitian and founder of Dining With Nature, common culprits and risk factors include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all fiber is equally as beneficial for easing constipation, but the King’s College London study found that the following foods stand out. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond that, it’s important to note that adequate hydration works synergistically with the following foods to prevent and manage constipation. This is because soluble and insoluble fiber rely on water to soften stool and support smooth bowel movements, and dehydration can make stool hard and difficult to pass, Hoch says. Therefore, in addition to a fiber-rich diet, she recommends aiming for at least eight to 10 cups of water per day (roughly 64 to 80 fluid ounces).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prunes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prunes are one of the best-known foods for relieving constipation thanks to their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561418300037" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high fiber and sorbitol content&lt;/a&gt;, Lamet says. “Fiber increases the bulk to the stool, making it easier for the intestine to push the stool along the digestive tract, and sorbitol is a sugar alcohol that is poorly absorbed by the body, which softens the stool and promotes bowel movements,” he explains. Note that half a cup of prunes contains about six grams of fiber, or over 20% of your daily needs, says &lt;a href="https://www.huesnutrition.com/about-5" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelly Taliaferro&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a registered dietitian and founder of Hues Nutrition. To hit the sweet spot, Dr Eirini Dimidi, lead study author and reader in nutritional sciences at King's College London, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kdkxy3veo" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;told the BBC&lt;/a&gt; that eight to 10 prunes each day should improve symptoms of constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Kiwi &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kiwi is a source of an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/18/2739" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;enzyme called actinidin&lt;/a&gt;, which supports gut motility and helps stool retain water, Hoch says. The tart fruit also contains water and a unique combination of soluble and insoluble fiber to increase fecal water content and accelerate gut transit time, Lamet says. He recommends eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10226473/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;two kiwis per day&lt;/a&gt; to stay regular. Per the study from King’s College, consuming two to three kiwis every day for at least four weeks was linked to improved stool consistency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rye bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rye bread is surprisingly &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.70173" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622070018" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that rye bread can relieve mild constipation and improve colonic metabolism more effectively than white bread, wheat bread, and commonly used laxatives without increasing the risk of uncomfortable gastrointestinal side effects. The King’s College study supports these findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-foods-that-may-help"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other foods that may help &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While prunes, kiwis, and rye bread emerged as top constipation-fighting foods at the King’s College London study, they are not the only ones that can help make your bowel movements more regular. Here are a few more expert-backed foods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Oatmeal  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oatmeal is a source of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which forms a gel-like substance to &lt;a href="https://applbiolchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13765-022-00680-3#Sec12" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soften stool and make bowel movements more comfortable&lt;/a&gt;, Taliaferro says. The overall fiber content of oatmeal also promotes regularity, so she suggests a half cup of rolled oats per day, since it contains about five grams of fiber or roughly 20% of your daily needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Legumes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Legumes such as beans, lentils, and chickpeas are sources of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79465-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/a&gt; (which acts similarly to soluble fiber) and fermentable fiber, which nourishes gut bacteria and supports regular bowel movements with consistent intake, Hoch says. The rich fiber content of legumes also softens stools while adding bulk to stimulate muscle contractions, so one to one-and-a-half cups of legumes four to five times per week is ideal, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Chia seeds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds absorb water to form a gel-like consistency, improving consistency and ease of passage by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9834868/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding bulk and softness to stool&lt;/a&gt;, Hoch says. The tiny seeds pack a serious soluble fiber punch though, so you only need one to two tablespoons per day, she adds. Need meal inspo? Add chia seeds into smoothies, yogurt, or oatmeal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Pears &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657810/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pears contain fiber, fructose, and sorbitol&lt;/a&gt;, all of which help draw water into the colon, softening stool and aiding elimination, Hoch says. The fruit also has a high water content, which is crucial for preventing the dehydration of stool, so Lamet says one pear a day can promote regular bowel movements. Fun fact: One pear has the same amount of fiber as a half cup of prunes, per Taliaferro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While technically a drink, coffee may be a good constipation remedy for some people, since &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17502-w" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine stimulates colon muscle contractions&lt;/a&gt; to induce a bowel movement, Lamet says. However, if consumed excessively, caffeine can lead to dehydration, which worsens constipation, so it’s best to max out at two cups per day, notes Taliaferro.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-and-how-often-should-you-eat-these-foods-to-see-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How much and how often should you eat these foods to see benefits? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a rule of thumb, Taliaferro says eating one to two servings of fiber-rich foods a day can help prevent constipation. For most people, that equates to roughly &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/health/essential-nutrients/carbohydrates/easy-ways-to-boost-fiber-in-your-daily-diet" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;25 to 34 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Too much of a good thing can backfire, though, and Hoch says a rapid influx of fiber can lead to bloating, gas, or diarrhea, especially if you don’t drink enough water. Given this, she recommends gradually increasing your fiber intake to avoid discomfort and allow your digestive system time to adequately adjust. In the case of coffee, too much caffeine can lead to anxiety, rapid heart rate, and nausea, so again, limit your intake to one to two cups per day, Taliaferro adds.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary changes can be a surprisingly quick way to find relief from constipation, though the exact time it takes to see results can vary, Lamet says. “The effects of a high-fiber diet are generally gradual, with initial improvements often noticed within a few days to a week, but it may take two to four weeks to see the full benefits and establish a routine.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Common myths about constipation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of misconceptions when it comes to constipation, so here’s a little cheat sheet on what’s actually fact versus fiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Coffee is a reliable laxative for everyone. &lt;/strong&gt;While coffee may stimulate bowel movements in some people, Hoch says it doesn’t work for everyone and can sometimes worsen constipation by causing dehydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth 2: You must have a bowel movement every day, otherwise you’re constipated.&lt;/strong&gt; Normal bowel habits vary widely, according to Hoch. Some people go three times per day, while others may go only three times per week — both can be healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth 3: Bananas cause constipation. &lt;/strong&gt;While bland foods like bananas may sit better on an upset stomach, there is no evidence to support they cause constipation, Taliaferro says. In fact, ripe bananas are a good source of soluble fiber and may help relieve constipation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth 4: Fiber supplements are just as good as food sources.&lt;/strong&gt; Whole foods provide a combination of fiber, water, enzymes, and other nutrients that generally make them more effective than isolated fiber supplements, Hoch says. However, supplemental fiber can be a beneficial addition to a diet for many. As the research from King’s College highlights, psyllium fiber enhanced stool frequency and consistency, and was linked to less strain during bowel movements. On the other hand, other types of fiber supplements like inulin and polydextrose offered minimal to no improvement and, in some cases, even exacerbated issues such as increased flatulence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth 5: Dairy products induce constipation. &lt;/strong&gt;While eating too much dairy may displace other nutrients like fiber, there is no scientific evidence that eating dairy causes constipation, Taliaferro says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-food-compares-to-over-the-counter-remedies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How food compares to over-the-counter remedies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements like psyllium husk and laxatives typically work through a single mechanism — either by adding bulk to stool, drawing water into the intestines, or stimulating intestinal muscles, Hoch says. “In contrast, whole foods such as prunes, kiwis, and legumes act through multiple mechanisms, combining fiber, enzymes, and natural compounds like sorbitol to support regularity more holistically,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lamet agrees, noting that natural foods often perform better than supplements, fortified products, and over-the-counter laxatives. “Whole foods provide a wide array of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and prebiotics that fiber supplements lack, which work together to support overall gut health and the beneficial bacteria in the microbiome in ways that isolated fibers cannot replicate.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, while supplements and laxatives may provide faster relief, Hoch says they can cause uncomfortable side effects such as gas, bloating, or cramping. Overuse of laxatives can also lead to dependency and long-term disruption of normal bowel function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, while healthcare providers generally recommend dietary changes as the first course of action for constipation, laxatives and supplements may be necessary if lifestyle modifications are insufficient, Lamet says. In these cases, your doctor can guide you on the best treatment plan.

    &lt;p&gt;The digital revolution has become a vast, unplanned experiment – and children are its most exposed participants. As ADHD diagnoses rise around the world, a key question has emerged: could the growing use of digital devices be playing a role? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922"&gt;we studied&lt;/a&gt; more than 8,000 children, from when they were around ten until they were 14 years of age. We asked them about their digital habits and grouped them into three categories: gaming, TV/video (YouTube, say) and social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter included apps such as TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, Messenger and Facebook. We then analysed whether usage was associated with long-term change in the two core &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/adhd-children-teenagers/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of ADHD: inattentiveness and hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main finding was that social media use was associated with a gradual increase in inattentiveness. Gaming or watching videos was not. These patterns remained the same even after accounting for children’s genetic risk for ADHD and their families’ income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also tested whether inattentiveness might cause children to use more social media instead. It didn’t. The direction ran one way: social media use predicted later inattentiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of how digital media affects attention are unknown. But the lack of negative effect of other screen activities means we can rule out any general, negative effect of screens as well as the popular notion that all digital media produces &lt;a href="https://carecounseling.healthcare/blog/dopamine-hits-what-they-are-and-why-everyones-talking-about-them-by-care-counseling-inc"&gt;“dopamine hits”&lt;/a&gt;, which then mess with children’s attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cognitive neuroscientists, we could make an educated guess about the mechanisms. Social media introduces constant distractions, preventing sustained attention to any task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is not the messages themselves that distract, the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. These distractions impair focus in the moment, and when they persist for months or years, they may also have long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming, on the other hand, takes place during limited sessions, not throughout the day, and involves a constant focus on one task at a time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Not all screens are equal.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/teenager-playing-video-games-home-2251926623?trackingId=673bfb1f-a944-4bec-b952-ce1af2f0da1c"&gt;Kleber Cordeiro/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of social media, using statistical measures, was not large. It was not enough to push a person with normal attention into ADHD territory. But if the entire population becomes more inattentive, many will cross the diagnostic border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, an increase of one hour of social media use in the entire population would increase the diagnoses &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatricsopenscience/article/doi/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922/205729/Digital-Media-Genetics-and-Risk-for-ADHD-Symptoms?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;by about 30%&lt;/a&gt;. This is admittedly a simplification, since diagnoses depend on many factors, but it illustrates how even an effect that is small at the individual level can have a significant effect when it affects an entire population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of data suggests that we have seen at least one hour more per day of social media during the last decade or two. Twenty years ago, social media barely existed. Now, teenagers are online for about &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512576/teens-spend-average-hours-social-media-per-day.aspx"&gt;five hours per day&lt;/a&gt;, mostly with social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage of teenagers who &lt;a href="https://actforyouth.org/adolescence/demographics/internet.cfm"&gt;claim to be “constantly online”&lt;/a&gt; has increased from 24% in 2015 to 46% 2023. Given that social media use has risen from essentially zero to around five hours per day, it may explain a substantial part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses during the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The attention gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the rise in the number of ADHD diagnoses reflects greater awareness and reduced stigma. That may be part of the story, but it doesn’t rule out a genuine increase in inattention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some studies that claim that the symptoms of inattention have not increased have often studied children who were probably &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.13700"&gt;too young to own a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, or a period of years that &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12882?casa_token=iFCzyGKPAg4AAAAA:ZO3AhZYxMjtpc4q-45aHhmg3hFAWFKgIYPDHB1mZGevAR8_KDcbBzxE_3cWbv6pyYC0Y_0YrxRhsCRFJ"&gt;mostly predates&lt;/a&gt; the avalanche in scrolling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media probably increases inattention, and social media use has rocketed. What now? The US requires children to be &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;at least 13&lt;/a&gt; to create an account on most social platforms, but these restrictions are easy to outsmart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is currently going the furthest. From &lt;a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions"&gt;December 10 2025&lt;/a&gt;, media companies will be required to ensure that users are 16 years or above, with high penalties for the companies that do not adhere. Let’s see what effect that legislation will have. Perhaps the rest of the world should follow the Australians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know those moments that are funny in real time, but become completely chaotic when they’re slowed down? This is one of them. And Boots proves it the second this video starts — he launches himself into the room, and his only mission seems to be “maximum mess, minimum braking distance.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clip, posted by @bigboyboots, really shows off the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever’s&lt;/a&gt; whole goofy, over-the-top personality. He’s a self-proclaimed “certified big chonk,” likely napping one minute and then suddenly deciding the laws of physics no longer apply to him the next. Watching a dog this joy-powered tear around in slow motion? It’s like getting a hit of happiness straight to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-s-expressions-in-slow-motion-video-impress-fans"&gt;Golden Retriever’s expressions in slow-motion video impress fans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The popular video starts with Boots bolting forward, and the slow motion makes you notice things you’d never catch at normal speed. His ears flap slowly, his fur moves in graceful waves, and his tail follows his body’s momentum. You can literally watch every muscle and joint doing its thing, turning even a simple head tilt into a full dramatic event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then he springs straight onto the couch, limbs flying, landing with the kind of enthusiasm only a dog who’s been doing couch zoomies since puppyhood can manage. They even synced it to the A Space Odyssey theme, because apparently, Boots needed a sci-fi soundtrack for his chaos. And they were right!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He looks, momentarily, like he’s starring in his own epic, dramatic sci-fi movie. Before you can recover, he leaps off the couch and comes straight for the camera, giving viewers a crystal-clear look at his joyful, slightly wild expression. And that’s it, the video ends with a slow-motion dismantling of the camera, which is equally funny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People went bonkers for Boots’s over-the-top, movie-worthy zoomies. They called the clip “cinema,” “a masterpiece,” and even “poetry in motion.” One person couldn’t get over the impact of that giant bounce. And honestly? Same. Boots in real time is probably adorable, but Boots in slow motion is a level of drama the world didn’t know it needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Five years on, more than 13.64 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. Thanks to the rapid roll-out of these vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01559-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01559-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; no longer a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;turning point for public health&lt;/a&gt; — but the downstream effects haven’t all been positive, argues Kristen Panthagani, a physician at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. In March 2020, Panthagani started a newsletter called &lt;a href="https://youcanknowthings.substack.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://youcanknowthings.substack.com/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Can Know Things&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which originally focused on addressing rumours and myths about COVID-19 vaccines and public-health measures. It now explores how the miscommunication of science and health measures has &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/why-is-trust-in-vaccines-declining" data-track="click" data-label="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/why-is-trust-in-vaccines-declining" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;damaged public trust in vaccines and scientific research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; spoke with Panthagani about what public-health institutions can learn from the pandemic, and how they can rebuild trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking back at the past five years, what lessons have been learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic was a steep learning curve. Nobody in our generation had ever encountered anything like that before and we must remember what we were dealing with at the time. It’s easy to beat ourselves up looking back, but it’s important that we look at what we can learn from that time and how we can do better going forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03151-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_51657224.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Public trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we’ve seen declining trust in childhood vaccines since the pandemic. The miscommunication and distrust over COVID-19 vaccines and mandates has influenced the uptake of other vaccines. The United States is now at risk &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03769-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03769-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;of losing its elimination status for measles&lt;/a&gt;, and that is directly related to vaccine coverage. Once measles vaccination drops below 95%, we start to lose herd immunity. If that were to happen, I think it would be a clear sign of this declining trust in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have to consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03384-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03384-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;declining access to vaccines in many parts of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and the challenges people have getting health-care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened during the pandemic that eroded people’s trust in vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about vaccines has been circulating for decades, but the difference now is that it’s spreading more loudly and is becoming more mainstream. Public-health specialists and governments didn’t communicate well during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in colloquial language, the word ‘immunity’ has this connotation of perfect protection — for example, with legal immunity, the idea is that you’re protected against prosecution. So, many people thought that the COVID-19 vaccine would give them 100% immunity, but then some of their family members were hospitalized owing to COVID-19, or died, and now the message is that you need a booster every year. After a while, people say: “You told me this and I got something completely different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03119-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_26931620.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;mRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel — what’s next for the technology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have gone a long way to tell people clearly, and early on, that the vaccines can be highly effective but are not perfect, and to acknowledge uncertainty in the data. There were scientists who were trying to do that, but it wasn’t the loud, predominant voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A calorie-restricted diet could slow down the aging that naturally happens in the brain as we get older, according to a new study of rhesus monkeys, and the findings could also be relevant to brain diseases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Boston University analyzed the brains of 24 rhesus monkeys (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that had been fed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-intermittent-fasting-or-calorie-counting-better-for-weight-loss-new-study-weighs-in"&gt;calorie-restricted&lt;/a&gt; or standard diets for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these lifelong dietary differences, the researchers found signs of healthier nerve communication and protection in brain tissue samples from the animals that consumed 30 percent fewer calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/dna.2021.0922"&gt;what we already know&lt;/a&gt; about diets with limited calories: By giving the body less fuel to work with, these diets can put the body's metabolism into a more efficient mode – which, in this study, appears to have protected against some of the cellular wear and tear that normally comes with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-gain-might-be-linked-to-lifestyle-instability-not-just-calories"&gt;Weight Gain Might Be Linked to 'Lifestyle Instability', Not Just Calories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While calorie restriction is a well-established intervention that can slow biological aging and may reduce age-related metabolic alterations in shorter-lived experimental models," &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/news-events/articles/2025/new-study-investigates-how-diet-may-slow-normal-brain-aging/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; first author, Boston University neurobiologist Ana Vitantonio, "this study provides rare, long-term evidence that calorie restriction may also protect against brain aging in more complex species."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-completely-new-cause-of-alzheimers-uncovered-in-our-brains-white-matter"&gt;specifically on myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the fatty coating around nerve fibers in the brain that protects them and speeds up communication between them.

In some cases, mechanisms designed to maintain good brain health actually go haywire and become harmful, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-revealed-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;leading to neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="184468" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="184468" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease become much more likely in old age – because brain cells are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;in a worse state&lt;/a&gt;, and their overactivity might cause some inadvertent damage, especially if the protective sheath around nerve cells is deteriorating with age, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have been &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb5153"&gt;revisiting the link&lt;/a&gt; between Alzheimer's disease and myelin decline, adding experimental evidence of myelin breakdown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12968"&gt;imaging data&lt;/a&gt; from people with rapid cognitive decline.

&lt;p&gt;There are some scientific findings you hear once and can’t un-hear. This is one of them. According to actual peer-reviewed research, women’s farts smell worse than men’s. Not louder, not more frequent. Just…stronger. On some level, this feels ironically correct, but still, nobody expected science to plant a flag in it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Humans pass gas up to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-causes-flatulence-and-what-to-do-when-its-a-problem-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;23 times a day&lt;/a&gt; on average, so Dr. Michael Levitt—a gastroenterologist affectionately known as the “King of Farts”—decided back in 1998 to understand why some of them hit harder. His study in &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/43/1/100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recruited 16 healthy volunteers and strapped them into what he described as a “flatus collection system,” which was essentially a rectal tube attached to a bag. Participants ate pinto beans, took a laxative, and let biology handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-70749707" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-70749707" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Levitt and his colleagues analyzed each sample using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Then they went a step further. They brought in two unsuspecting judges to smell every fart and rate it on an eight-point scale. The judges did not know what they were sniffing. You can imagine how that debrief went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings were blunt. Men produced more volume, but women’s gas contained a significantly higher concentration of hydrogen sulfide—the sulfur compound behind the classic “rotten egg” smell. The judges agreed, consistently rating women’s farts as more intense. Science had spoken, and the conclusion was undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-60064146" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-60064146" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTE5IGFpLWxpc3QtYmxvY2staXAnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgoKPGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nYWktZHluYW1pYyBhaS1pcC1kYXRhJyAgY291bnRyaWVzPSdERSwgS1InIGNvdW50cnktbGlzdD0nVycgZGF0YS1jb2RlPSdQR1JwZGlCamJHRnpjejBuYkc1bmRHUXRaSGx1WVcxcFl5MXBibUZ5ZEdsamJHVW5JSE4wZVd4bFBTSnRhVzR0YUdWcFoyaDBPak13TUhCNE95QmhiR2xuYmkxcGRHVnRjem9nWTJWdWRHVnlPeUJxZFhOMGFXWjVMV052Ym5SbGJuUTZJR05sYm5SbGNqc2daR2x6Y0d4aGVUb2dabXhsZURzaVBqd3ZaR2wyUGc9PSc+PC9kaXY+CjwvZGl2Pgo=" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Socially, this tracks with other research. A &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2005 study&lt;/a&gt; found that heterosexual men were the least bothered by their own emissions being audible or detectable, while heterosexual women were the most self-conscious. Which honestly makes the biochemical twist even funnier. The thing women tend to be more embarrassed about might actually be helping them.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide, though toxic in large amounts, plays important roles inside the body. It helps brain cells communicate through a process called sulfhydration. Levels drop with age and are especially low in patients with Alzheimer’s. A &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2021 Johns Hopkins study&lt;/a&gt; on mice genetically engineered to mimic human Alzheimer’s found that a hydrogen sulfide-releasing compound improved memory and motor function by about 50 percent over twelve weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-51656935" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-51656935" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Researchers stopped short of claiming this translates directly to humans, but the implication is wild. A smellier fart might reflect higher hydrogen sulfide activity, which could be linked to healthier brain signaling over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the next time a woman drops something eye-watering, remember you might be witnessing peak neurological maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

He said, “The fact is that your liver, kidneys, lungs, gut and immune system already detoxify the body every second.&lt;/span&gt; However, what you can do is support these systems through simple daily habits that, over time, lower your risk of many cancers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why are daily habits important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;So while cancer risk can never be brought to exactly zero, how you live every day does play an instrumental role in reducing or increasing the chances.&lt;/span&gt; The habits may seem inconsequential, but they build up, compound over time and ultimately shape long-term health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The oncologist elaborated, “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;None of these habits will guarantee that cancer will never occur, but together, when you follow these daily over years, they have an impact and reduce your risk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Turkar also highlighted that people should understand their medical risk based on genetics, and family history and go for regular screening. He said, &lt;span&gt;"If you have a family history of cancer or other risk factors, speak to your doctor about personalised screening and prevention alongside these everyday steps.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 detox tips to reduce cancer risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Turkar shared a brief guide on detox tips, covering essentials ranging from diet to daily physical activity:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Cut back on alcohol and drink more water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/08/550x309/1241_1765190408892_1765190414327.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Drink more water instead of alcohol.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start each morning with plain water instead of sugary drinks or “detox” concoctions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sip water regularly throughout the day so your kidneys and liver can process waste efficiently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep alcohol as low as possible; alcohol is a proven risk for breast, liver, head and neck, and colorectal cancers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Fill half your plate with vegetables and fruits at every main meal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/04/550x309/broc_1735989710373_1735989738889.webp" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat more cruciferous veggies like broccoli.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colourful vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lentils and beans are rich in fibre and natural antioxidants that help neutralise harmful molecules and support healthy metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fibre helps in cleansing the bowel and reducing the time potential carcinogens spend in contact with the gut lining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower contain compounds that help the liver process toxins and must be part of your diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid processed meats and very salty, fried foods. An unhealthy diet is a major preventable cause of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Move your body for at least 30 minutes most days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/14/550x309/walking_for_squats_1760450871163_1760450878669.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Try brisk walking to elevate your heart rate.(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Try brisk walking to elevate your heart rate.(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Try brisk walking to elevate your heart rate.(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brisk walking, cycling, dancing, or any activity that raises your heart rate and makes you slightly breathless helps reduce cancer risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, reduces chronic inflammation and helps maintain a healthy weight and BMI, reducing risk of breast, colon, endometrial and other cancers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Practice active living - walking instead of driving short distances, taking the stairs, and short movement breaks in the office all add up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Protect your lungs and your environment every day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/04/550x309/Qubo_air_purifiers_1764836315867_1764836315992.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Use an air purifier and stay indoors." title="Use an air purifier and stay indoors."&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Use an air purifier and stay indoors. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not smoke, avoid secondhand smoke, and stay away from vaping. At home, ventilate your kitchen while cooking and avoid smoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If living in urban areas with high AQI, limit being outside and consider a well-fitting mask when outdoors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleaner air means less direct contact between carcinogens and your airway lining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Prioritise sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/06/original/13450_1762414204319.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Use a sleep mask to block out harsh lights in the morning when you sleep.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aim for at least 7 to 8 hours of regular, good-quality sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Night after night of short or irregular sleep disrupts hormones such as cortisol, insulin and melatonin, which play roles in cell growth and repair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Reduce stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/27/550x309/Music_streaming_apps_1764228314124_1764228314324.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Listen to music to calm down and de-stress.

(Picture credit: Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Build a simple wind-down routine: dim screens and avoid screens an hour or two before sleeping, read, stretch or meditate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Healthy stress outlets like walking, listening to music, talking to a friend or journaling also reduce the pull of coping habits such as smoking, binge eating or drinking that increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;The state has higher rates of flu hospitalizations, emergency room visits and positive tests than it did at this time last year, state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said. People who haven’t gotten their flu shots should do so now, particularly since it takes two weeks to develop full immunity after vaccination, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is absolutely here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus activity is still low, Herlihy said. Viruses often peak at different times, which is good for the health care system because it limits the number of people getting sick at once, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries have also had an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evere-flu-strain-h3n2-us-response-outbreaks-canada-uk-rcna243431"&gt;early start to the flu season&lt;/a&gt;, but experts are waiting for further data from overseas before projecting if the virus will peak early, Herlihy said. Even if it does, though, the season often includes a long tail following the peak, or a second wave with a different virus subtype, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we reach the peak, the best-case scenario is we’re halfway through the season,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number and demographics of people who need hospital care for respiratory viruses doesn’t look unusual as of early December, said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth. The &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/vaccine-rates-fall-as-2025-marks-worst-flu-year-on-record/news-story/f344d7a3fa69d1af469de0d1c7a457ba"&gt;Southern Hemisphere did have a more-severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; over what we experience as summer, however, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So far, the numbers don’t look out of the ordinary, but we’re at the beginning,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;National experts have warned that this flu season could be severe, though not enough data has come in to know for certain. A flu subtype called H3N2 picked up seven mutations since last respiratory season. Countries have surveillance systems to look for any new mutations in flu viruses, though most end up being unimportant, said May Chu, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to remain alert,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early data from the United Kingdom and Japan suggest this flu season could be severe again, because immune systems haven’t encountered the variant known as subclade K before and it arrived too late to include in this year’s shots, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, said in a news conference. But the shot is still worth getting, even with imperfect protection, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lot better than nothing, and it’s the best thing you can do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Last season was the most severe for children since the 2009 swine flu pandemic. The CDC determined &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html"&gt;279 children died of flu complications&lt;/a&gt; and children’s hospitals reported &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33419/Rare-neurological-flu-complication-strikes-at?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;unusual neurological complications in kids&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom were unvaccinated. The government doesn’t track adult flu deaths precisely, but produced a broad estimate of somewhere between 38,000 and 99,000 in the most recent season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data doesn’t yet show whether subclade K is more severe than other types of H3N2, Herlihy said. It wouldn’t have to be to cause a severe season, however – if more people get the flu, the number of severe cases and deaths also will rise, even without a change in virulence, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of this is a numbers game,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the mutated variant, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season?utm_source=General+Interest&amp;amp;utm_campaign=240dcacfee-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_11_19_06_15&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-240dcacfee-465918388"&gt;early data from the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; suggests the vaccine is between 30% and 40% effective in preventing hospitalization in adults and about 70% effective in children. That suggests vaccine effectiveness is on the lower end of the normal range, Herlihy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25% of eligible Coloradans have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu vaccine this year&lt;/a&gt;, compared to 27% at the same time last year. The drop was sharper for COVID-19, from about 14% to 11%. Anyone 6 months or older who doesn’t have a medical contraindication, such as a severe allergy to the vaccine ingredients, can get both shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, vaccination rates also appear to be down. IQVIA, a health data company, estimated pharmacies and long-term care facilities provided about 27% fewer COVID-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IQVIA-Adult-Vx-Trends-FINAL.pdf"&gt;between early August and mid-November&lt;/a&gt; than they did during the same period last year. Flu shots dropped more modestly, by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These numbers aren’t just statistics. They represent real gaps in protection,” Dr. Bob Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said during a news conference Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When the brain's typical wiring patterns shift from the norm, it leads to psychotic disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="184295" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers have identified 'brainquakes' that disrupt the brain's connectivity in people who live with these conditions and experience debilitating psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping out the role these brainquakes play, the research team hopes to get a better understanding of common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-psychosis-may-be-fundamentally-flawed-study-finds"&gt;brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps a step closer to treatment interventions that can help manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint Where Extreme Moods of Bipolar Disorder Exist in Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, these brainquakes are an imbalance between the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2021.07.008"&gt;redundancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01070-0"&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt; of brain networks, whereby brain cell circuits process either shared or complementary information, respectively. Redundancy makes the brain more robust, while synergy allows it to extract more information from related inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of the people with psychotic disorders were noticeably &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-reveals-how-often-cannabis-triggers-psychotic-episodes"&gt;more unbalanced&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found, showing more irregular and random connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions," Qiang Li, a &lt;span&gt;computational&lt;/span&gt; neuroscientist at the TReNDS (Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science) Center in Atlanta, and colleagues &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed detailed brain scans of 1,111 participants, including 288 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;with schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, 183 with bipolar disorder, and 640 healthy controls. &lt;span&gt;Each scan lasted about five minutes, with the analysis tuned to find higher-order (more complex) interactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg" alt="Brain regions" class="wp-image-184298 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains-600x500.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers mapped brain domains and the communications between them.

At the moment, it's not clear if these disruptions are helping to drive psychotic disorders or are something that's a consequence of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is such a sophisticated network system that it makes picking apart the causes of conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder very challenging, though progress is being made. We're getting better at identifying people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-new-blood-test-predicts-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;at a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of these conditions, for example, through biomarkers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know about some of the triggers that can cause psychotic episodes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-potency-cannabis-linked-to-dramatically-higher-risk-of-psychotic-episodes"&gt;high-potency cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these discoveries tells us a bit more about what the brain is doing when it takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-discovery-helps-explain-how-cannabis-triggers-psychosis"&gt;a few steps outside of reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the latest figures, as many &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/psychosis/"&gt;as 3 in 100 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US will have a psychotic episode at some point in their lives – and while there are ways of managing these conditions, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-new-schizophrenia-treatment-in-decades-a-much-needed-alternative"&gt;continue to work&lt;/a&gt; on finding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-drugs-may-have-been-off-target-for-decades-study-finds"&gt;more effective treatments&lt;/a&gt; with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Locals who swarmed out to investigate the specimen described elephantine legs, a fish-like tail and a long neck stretched across the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quickly dubbed a sea monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographs published at the time reveal that much of the monster’s carcass had collapsed, leaving only the head mostly intact. Its eyes were small, its forehead bulbous; its jaws formed a duck-like beak. Sensational accounts were plastered across newspapers from California to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this “monster” reveals how genuine scientific mysteries feed fear of the unknown, spawning myths and misinformation. The rotting corpse has, over the last 100 years, stoked arguments between creationists and evolutionary biologists. But together with the remains of stranded marine animals more recently found on the beaches of California, the long-ago discovery has also helped scientists understand the biology of an elusive deep-sea whale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-94amudz6" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_94amudz6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barton Warren Evermann, then director of the California Academy of Sciences, visited the specimen on the beach and identified it as a beaked whale — a little-studied group of whales with dolphin-like heads — and had the specimen sent to the academy. Scientists there later confirmed the creature was a Baird’s beaked whale, Berardius bairdii, publishing their findings in 1929 in the Journal of Mammalogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Cruz sea monster shows how decay can mislead even careful observers. Decomposing whales can form a tubular shape known as a “whale sock,” said Moe Flannery, ornithology and mammalogy collections manager at the California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a decaying whale carcass hits the beach, injury to the body, as well as gas released when microbes digest the tissues and gut contents, can cause the sock to transform into weird shapes. “All the bones fall out, and the skin just kind of flows around,” Flannery said.&lt;/p&gt;

It was initially speculated that the whale was a plesiosaur. (Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This likely explains why witnesses spoke of the monster’s long neck. The Santa Cruz Evening News reported that a local resident and twice-president of the National History Society of British Columbia by the name of E.L. Wallace suggested it was a plesiosaur — a long-necked, predatory marine reptile from the age of the dinosaurs. According to the news article, Wallace speculated that the beast had been preserved for eons in glacial ice that recently melted.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;But Wallace’s identity is a mystery. In a post on Instagram, the California Academy of Sciences noted that there are no records that he existed or was president of the British Columbia society. Still, his erroneous identification thrust the decaying remains into the heart of sea monster lore — Scotland’s mythical Loch Ness Monster has been claimed to be a plesiosaur that somehow escaped extinction — and into the war between creationism and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monster washed up just a couple of months before the Scopes Monkey Trial, in which a Tennessee teacher was accused of violating a state law that banned teaching about human evolution. For creationists, the existence of modern plesiosaurs would support claims that the Earth has only existed for a few thousand years, and that people and dinosaurs coexisted — the modern young-earth creationist website Genesis Park includes a post on the Santa Cruz sea monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real science behind the monster is less outlandish — but still mysterious. Today, the creature’s preserved skull resides at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. It isn’t on public display, but is available to scientists conducting research. “We’re like a library, but instead of books, we have specimens,” said Flannery, who showed the remains to Bay Area News Group in early November.&lt;/p&gt;

(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection includes bones from two Baird’s beaked whales that washed onto the San Francisco and Point Reyes coasts in 2003 and 2016. Although the more recent carcasses were more complete when they were found, only a few bones were collected. The species can grow to 35 feet long and weigh over 26,000 pounds, making storage of entire specimens difficult.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;While these whales are massive, they are notoriously elusive: “What’s amazing to me is that you can have an animal that is 25 feet long, basically bigger than anything that lives on land, and we know basically zero about it,” said Ari Friedlaender, a marine ecologist at UC Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedlaender has seen only a handful of Baird’s beaked whales in 15 years of studying marine life in California. Rather than go searching for the whales, Friedlaender collaborates with other researchers who monitor whale sounds through an underwater microphone sitting at the end of a 32-mile cable in Monterey Bay. When the team is notified that Baird’s beaked whales are in the area, all hands are on deck. “We’ll drop everything we’re doing and try and get out there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strandings like the one in 1925 provide a rare opportunity to study a whale’s age, diet, health and causes of death using bone and teeth samples. In a statement, the Academy of Sciences noted that “all marine mammal stranding activities are conducted under authorization by the National Marine Fisheries Service through a stranding agreement issued to the California Academy of Sciences and an MMPA/ESA permit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a huge amount we can learn from them. There’s almost no ceiling on how valuable an individual like this is,” said Friedlaender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What scientists do know is that the species is particularly social, typically traveling in groups of five to 20. They live and feed in deep water, diving a mile down to hunt for prey including squid, octopus and rockfish. Sometimes, they will remain underwater for over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re very cryptic,” said Friedlaender. “They’re at the surface very infrequently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Cruz sea monster story shines a light on human psychology, highlighting how readily the unfamiliar is transformed into mythical tales. “When something this big washes up that you’ve never seen before and you have no perspective for what it is, ‘a monster’ seems very appropriate,” Friedlander said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also illustrates how people use monster stories to rationalize their fears and represent challenging problems facing society, according to Michael Chemers, director of the Center for Monster Studies at UC Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that people fear most is the unknown, and the sea represents the deep unknown,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s especially important to pay attention to brain-related changes as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all cognitive changes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, some are. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Gregory Day" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Gregory Day&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral neurologist and dementia specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida, defines dementia as a “change in memory and thinking. So, something that’s different from before — and for me to consider it as dementia, it needs to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is only expected to become more common in this country; recent research predicts 42% of American adults over 55 will have dementia in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding the signs of the disease and getting an early diagnosis, individuals and caretakers can better plan and prepare for the future, and potentially make decisions about care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis can also help folks potentially get access to treatments that can help slow the progression of certain forms of dementia, experts told HuffPost. (Dementia is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most common type.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early signs of dementia are important to know but can “run the gamut,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stephanie Nothelle" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nothelle&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, but there tend to be a few that often present first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Short-term memory loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the thing that people often think about is short-term memory loss, and that really is common,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the same thing as momentarily forgetting the word you want to use or a one-off absentminded moment, like forgetting to grab your hat before going out for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s something like “having a conversation with someone and then a couple hours later, not remembering the details of that conversation,” explained Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago, said that it’s also common for folks with short-term memory loss to repeat themselves in conversations and ask “the same questions frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A hard time holding on to things that they’ve learned recently. That’s a short-term memory issue,” Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Day, there are some real-world, practical issues he tends to look for as potential memory red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for people who have made mistakes, maybe with medications, where they wouldn’t have before [such as forgetting to take it or taking a double dose], perhaps some difficulty keeping track of appointments and keeping the days straight, needing more reminders for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short-term memory loss could also look like missing appointments or showing up on the wrong day or having difficulty finding their way along a familiar route, Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally more forgetful than others and have been that way all of their lives. That’s not worrisome. Instead, Day is concerned with “changes from before that are consistent or starting to become consistent, that are beginning to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble with the ‘planning part of your brain.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for people to experience trouble with “executive functioning,” which Nothelle describes as the “planning part of your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if you have a complex task, [for example] you have to plan a dinner party and you’re having a hard time doing everything involved ... there’s all these little logistics and things to keep track of when planning something like a dinner party,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have to remember your guest’s dietary restrictions, plan out a menu, shop for ingredients, cook, arrange serving dishes, clean, make cocktails and choose a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not able to do that anymore, that can be a sign that there’s something going on,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;While dementia can present in many different ways, short-term memory loss and personality changes are among the early signs of the disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personality changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way that I have seen it manifest is people will have changes in their mood or their personality,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a loved one who used to be very outgoing is now more shy or vice versa. Or maybe someone is more apathetic or, perhaps, more impulsive than they used to be. This isn’t normal aging or an older person just not having a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all just reflections of subtle changes in the brain,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consistent trouble finding the right word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint and reason people seek medical attention is word-finding difficulty, Day said. “Occasional difficulty coming up with a name, fine,” said Day. It’s also normal to sometimes forget the name of a common object, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s inconsistent, not a concern, but when this is an everyday thing and maybe even when it’s interrupting conversation, now that’s a sign of much more prominent word-finding difficulty that would warrant evaluation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Susceptibility to financial scams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that we need to be really, really aware of, and unfortunately just gets more and more common, is susceptibility to financial scams,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with dementia are at increased risk, and scammers know that, so they tend to prey on older individuals in the middle of the afternoon,” added Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is shame involved with falling for a scam, but scammers are getting smarter and sneakier, making it easier and easier to fall for the trick, noted Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you have a loved one who falls for one of these scams, it’s worth inquiring about their cognitive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is common, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy lifestyle habits &lt;a href="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can not only slow the progression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;can not only slow the progression&lt;/a&gt; of dementia but can also help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, genetics put them at higher risk of developing dementia, but “even in people where there is a genetic component, there’s good evidence to say that all of the following still make an impact, and maybe make an even bigger impact,” Fleisher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, folks should follow the advice from their doctors when it comes to maintaining a healthy body — these habits also help maintain a healthy brain, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important things that I think about ... well, we should be screening for high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar problems, and treating or addressing those problems when they exist,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should also prioritize a good night’s sleep, he said, and manage things like sleep apnea — “addressing that and treating that effectively can really improve brain health and brain function, and, I think, decrease the risk of dementia in the future,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then there’s the day-to-day things, good brain housekeeping things, we all know we should be doing,” Day said. This includes exercising, eating a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and veggies, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alcohol-link-serious-illnesses_l_68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563?origin=life-featured" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="limiting (or not drinking) alcohol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;limiting (or not drinking) alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and quitting smoking. It’s also helpful to spend time with other people, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can sometimes seem daunting. If you’re reading a long list of things and you’re not doing any of them, you don’t have to start doing them all immediately,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take that small step forward ... introduce a 20-minute walk three times a week — you don’t have to start training for a marathon,” Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are positive steps towards brain health, and if the goal is to reduce the future risk of dementia, I think each of those steps matters and can be helpful for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a cure for dementia, these changes can help people who are diagnosed, Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to use everything at our disposal to slow down progression so people can live longer and live better and have better quality of life in that time,” Fleisher said. “There are countless examples of people living well with dementia. I think that stigma of getting this diagnosis and that being ‘the end,’ that is not where we are in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia are living rich, full lives because they’re empowered by knowledge and helpful health care teams, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPMy1KclcyWng4WHBERlpfZlpydTVCaE8zdXo4S05Vc09pNTU0cGRsT09jYnpNQ3pVLUNELWxsV0F2SE55TzVodlo4V1I2M0s3eDBvempmV1RiaG9SRy1KdURpaEtoSlVxQzAzeHZrU2k5M2V6c044LUtQd0RMODBETkJfX2pMWkhUek9EVDV6T1JRZEU5T0Jr0gGcAUFVX3lxTE0xRW9pQVAwVG1Cd3ZhZUZGTnFOb2N4WEg5NENTYjAyazE1WmhpWV9iYnp3UE1LaTZyRmM4RFhnVDI2dVBuOHJKRTlaU3RSOUhNYUswQnFVMVhrVHRDd2tZZHUySkM3T21PYUd4WktOOGRSNkl1SmZKLTZGTkFBb3poYUlSckYxSUhyT3dLY0RXX0FiLV8wVDNTb2RiRg</guid></item><item><title>睡眠或锻炼对健康更重要吗？新研究权衡- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/12/08/getting-enough-sleep-may-be-the-key-to-staying-healthy-new-research-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[�6a�z{hR�~�1�&amp;amp;�PG�?��c`0��0-���t�=^�������+��g��,���eY�5-�K�gq�: V�El ,�����=����?�ُ��_j_��jo�3vz��N����g�x�FHT#١��6��4�����;��~�����/����!R�F��g&amp;amp;��&amp;gt;p�T�z�JZS%����e��J�xὪW%uw�&amp;gt;I=���9rf�v�)�,�zf�������?�����T�2�N1�,���UB��x\�����  �!���%������` ��c ��2�(oʷc

&lt;p&gt;New archaeological research is turning a long-accepted idea about human evolution on its head—challenging the belief that meat was the cornerstone of early human diets and that plant foods only rose to prominence with the arrival of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a comprehensive study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10814-025-09214-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Archaeological Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, scientists present new evidence showing that early humans across multiple continents were gathering, cooking, and grinding wild plants tens of thousands of years before farming began. The data reveal a far more &lt;strong&gt;nutritionally diverse prehistoric diet&lt;/strong&gt; than previously understood, one that included a wide array of seeds, nuts, and starchy roots.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/humans-ate-plant-foods-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Early humans ate processed plant foods long before farming, new study shows" class="wp-image-53419" data-lazy-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/humans-ate-plant-foods-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/humans-ate-plant-foods-2.jpg" alt="Early humans ate processed plant foods long before farming, new study shows" class="wp-image-53419"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map of all archaeological sites with direct evidence for early plant food use, dating from ≥35 kya, as well as, Ohalo II; listed in chronological order. Credit: Florin, S.A., Ramsey, M.N., Journal of Archaeological Research (2025)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This new perspective disrupts the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/these-prehistoric-paintings-which-arent-human-hold-a-secret-that-could-rewrite-human-evolution/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74787" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; conventional narrative of human evolution&lt;/a&gt;, shaped largely around hunting and animal protein. Rather than viewing plant use as a &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/150-million-year-old-fossil-flight-secret/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80809" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secondary adaptation&lt;/a&gt; or late innovation, the study positions it as a central feature of &lt;strong&gt;human dietary flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;, predating agriculture by tens of millennia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Grinding Stones and Root Ovens: The Evidence Beneath Our Feet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by teams from the &lt;strong&gt;Australian National University&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;University of Toronto Mississauga&lt;/strong&gt;, draws on archaeological data from &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/evidence-prehistoric-humans-isle-of-skye/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79524" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prehistoric sites&lt;/a&gt; spanning Africa, the Levant, Southeast Asia, and Australia. These sites have yielded grinding stones, charred plant remains, and cooking tools—direct evidence of &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric plant food preparation&lt;/strong&gt; dating back at least &lt;strong&gt;35,000 years&lt;/strong&gt;, and possibly much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;Ohalo II&lt;/strong&gt;, a lakeside site in Israel dated to 23,000 years ago, archaeologists recovered &lt;strong&gt;grinding tools embedded with starch granules&lt;/strong&gt;, along with well-preserved remains of &lt;strong&gt;wild wheat, barley, and legumes&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other side of the world, in &lt;strong&gt;Madjedbebe&lt;/strong&gt;, Northern Australia, residues found on stone tools suggest the processing of yams, seeds, and other &lt;strong&gt;starchy wild plants&lt;/strong&gt; more than &lt;strong&gt;65,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;—the oldest known human site on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/2025/12/humans-ate-plant-foods-long-before-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;These findings&lt;/a&gt;—now compiled and analyzed in one of the most extensive global reviews to date—undermine the long-standing belief that early humans relied primarily on hunting large game. Instead, the evidence shows a deep, widespread tradition of &lt;strong&gt;plant-based subsistence strategies&lt;/strong&gt; well before domestication began.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Humans Couldn’t Live on Meat Alone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a biological ceiling to how much lean meat humans can digest. Without adequate fat or carbohydrates, high-protein diets can lead to a condition sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;rabbit starvation&lt;/strong&gt;, characterized by nausea, weakness, and eventual metabolic failure. This means early humans needed more than just protein—they needed a reliable source of &lt;strong&gt;complex carbohydrates and plant-based fats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plant foods—especially those that required processing—offered a dense, portable, and renewable source of energy. Roots, nuts, and seeds, once cooked or ground, could provide vital calories for mobile groups crossing harsh environments like &lt;strong&gt;deserts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;highlands&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;savannas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Ramsey et al. and Clarkson et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study authors also emphasize the &lt;strong&gt;technological innovations&lt;/strong&gt; that supported this dietary flexibility. Tools such as &lt;strong&gt;grinding stones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pounding implements&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;earth ovens&lt;/strong&gt; allowed early humans to unlock nutrients from otherwise indigestible or bitter plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than reacting to food scarcity, these groups appear to have had extensive knowledge of &lt;strong&gt;local flora&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the techniques needed to process it. The scale and diversity of these behaviors suggest a long-term adaptation rather than an opportunistic survival tactic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rethinking the “Broad Spectrum Revolution”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, archaeologists described the late pre-agricultural period as a &lt;strong&gt;“Broad Spectrum Revolution”&lt;/strong&gt;—a time when humans expanded their diets to include smaller game and plant foods, leading eventually to domestication. But this new research challenges that framing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a sudden dietary expansion, the study proposes that humans were &lt;strong&gt;always broad-spectrum foragers&lt;/strong&gt;—a strategy that likely defined our species from its earliest phases. To reflect this, the authors introduce a new term: the &lt;strong&gt;“Broad Spectrum Species.”&lt;/strong&gt; In this framework, &lt;strong&gt;diverse plant consumption&lt;/strong&gt; is not a precursor to farming, but a long-standing evolutionary advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This adaptability may explain why &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, unlike other hominins, successfully migrated into such a wide range of ecosystems. The ability to harness both &lt;strong&gt;animal protein and wild carbohydrates&lt;/strong&gt; allowed for survival in regions where one or the other alone would not have sufficed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, roughly &lt;strong&gt;80% of the global human diet&lt;/strong&gt; consists of plant-based foods. This is often viewed as a byproduct of modern agriculture, but the research suggests otherwise. Our dependence on plants runs deeper—it’s rooted in tens of thousands of years of innovation, selection, and trial-and-error with wild resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one in five people in a German cohort had long COVID in 2022&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and around one in seven people in the United States were affected by long COVID by late 2023&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This translates to a significant burden on healthcare and the economy — the syndrome is estimated to cost the world economy US$1 trillion every year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From many conversations, I know what a great burden these illnesses represent for those affected and their families,” said Dorothee Bär, the German Federal Research Minister, in a press release announcing the funding. “There are still no simple solutions or therapies for ME/CFS and post-viral autoimmune diseases, and previous scientific studies demonstrate the complexity of the disease mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really major funding,” says Rafael Mikolajczyk, an epidemiologist at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, agrees, saying it’s “a great step in the right direction”. Long COVID has become politicized and “less of a priority for governments around the world,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What research is the money expected to support?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German government aims to fund research into a wide variety of post-infectious diseases, including Long COVID and ME/CFS. It also aims to cover a range of topics, including the pathophysiology and immunology of the conditions, diagnostics and biomarkers, mental health and neurology, and long-term consequences on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The language is deliberately broad, says Al-Aly, who under the Biden administration co-chaired the committee that created the US’s &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/storage/2022/06/Towards-a-Patient-Driven-National-Research-Action-Plan.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/storage/2022/06/Towards-a-Patient-Driven-National-Research-Action-Plan.pdf" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;National Research Action Plan for Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;. “You don’t want to shackle your scientists with a very narrow scope,” he says. He applauds the funding for including all post-infectious conditions, which share many commonalities, and for embracing a variety of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the German funding is not yet allocated, the next step is for scientists and patients to be brought in to shape exactly how the money will be spent, says Ulrike Protzer, a virologist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00995-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_50843280.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Long COVID activists fought Trump team’s research cuts and won ― for now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fundamental challenge for managing conditions like long COVID is to identify the mechanisms operating in each long COVID patient, says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut. Only then can they be recruited into clinical trials of medications that will treat these root causes. That means link biomarker studies to clinical trials, says Al-Aly – like giving antivirals primarily to people with persistent viral infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisreen Alwan, a public health specialist at the University of Southampton, UK, also wants to see more research characterising the public health burden of post-infection conditions. “How do we quantify the burden of acute infections in terms of chronic disease? What are the pathways to prevention? How can we address the risk factors?” She compares viral infections to outdoor air pollution, the impacts of which on cardiovascular health have now been quantified — spurring efforts to cut pollution levels. “that's where we should be heading for acute viral infections,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A woman in a striped knitted sweater looks at the camera from behind a cart loaded with medication bottles in her apartment." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Long-COVID advocates and researchers in the United States managed to revive some of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00703-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00703-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Joe Klamar/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened with previous research drives?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One example gaining scientific attention is the BK virus, a common childhood infection that typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms before becoming permanently dormant in the urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea6124" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research published in Science Advances by Dr Simon Baker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and colleagues at the University of York has highlighted how this virus, present in most people since childhood, may cause specific DNA damage that increases the risk of bladder cancer years or even decades later. After the initial infection, the virus settles quietly in the kidney, bladder, and ureter, where it remains inactive in individuals with strong immunity. However, when the immune system becomes weakened, such as during chronic illness or after organ transplantation, the virus can reactivate. The newly identified DNA damage linked to this reactivation offers important clues about how bladder cancer may develop even when tumours show no remaining trace of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study links childhood virus to DNA damage and bladder cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BK virus typically remains dormant in the kidney after being acquired as a child. This might be an especially stressful moment for kidney transplant recipients. Although BK virus infections do not cause visible symptoms, kidney transplant recipients who require immunosuppressants have provided valuable insights about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunosuppressants can cause dormant BK virus to reactivate and harm the kidneys, ureter, and bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In laboratory investigations with human urinary tract tissue, the scientists detected DNA damage patterns generated by the cell's antiviral defences following controlled exposure to BK virus, a childhood infection previously identified as lying latent in the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the struggle against the BK virus, friendly fire from enzymes designed to kill the virus can inflict collateral damage to the cells' own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information supports the idea that an individual's antiviral response to BK virus infection generates DNA alterations that can lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current bladder cancer preventive efforts encourage people to quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a new option to potentially prevent bladder cancer by identifying and controlling the BK virus earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon said, “This is a major shift in our thinking about the origins of bladder cancers. Because kidney transplant recipients are affected by the BK virus and are over three times more likely to develop bladder cancer, we suspected that the BK virus was involved, but didn’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can now see how BK virus may contribute to bladder cancer, in transplant recipients and the general population, and explain why tumours show no trace of the virus years later. It gives us motivation to seek prevention strategies for both bladder cancer and the kidney damage caused by BK virus. With support from Kidney Research UK and York Against Cancer, our lab is developing new ways to control BK virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bladder cancer symptoms include more frequent and painful urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, incontinence and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the causes of BK virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/conditions-symptoms/bk-virus/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kidney Research UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, BKN has increased over the years, most likely due to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more powerful anti-rejection medications used now increase the chance of contracting infections, particularly viral ones. Better infection diagnosis has also contributed to the increase in rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 6% of persons who have had kidney transplants will develop BKN within five years of the transplant, with the great majority occurring within the first two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;BK virus treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/conditions-symptoms/bk-virus/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kidney Research UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, BK infection is indicative of excessive immunosuppression. Currently, the primary treatment is to gradually reduce the potency of the medicines used to suppress a person's immune system, which may often control the virus without causing kidney transplant rejection. Antiviral medications may also be administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can take weeks to notice the benefits of these medicines; therefore, blood tests may be ordered to track improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the virus is found early, these therapies may be effective before kidney function is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxPdmJjMUlxYUZVR3kzTjVUS3Q1RFFWMnRja2FaZTd3YjB2UldLZkNyRzlxeWR2aE1XckxycnE4NDUxN2V5R2N0LWstMFM3c3hDcWRhbEVadmFXSTNaZkdKTGpaUzZVaWFRcUIyMk9LQ3RWZXo3QWc3QTJEc3VENU5uRWVDMVAyX2hOVVZCVTRzLU1fQzdTWkJLbnlLdEFvZzZuRWxwZzlzUTJ3ZUpMZ2Y4SDdieUZpV3BHazVIaWJGdER6Rmg4Y2hoRVVoRGxrNlFLS3RrVC1sZ043WXVZaHRrZFNTUnJHbjhzcTdsYlBfaEg0NWlpU3hwQmVLZC0zczlyWU5KcHZtdjJGMTN1X1c0elFuUkw</guid></item><item><title>美国男子接受受感染肾脏后死于狂犬病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/us-man-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-infected-kidney</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A recipient of a kidney transplant presented a medical mystery when he died from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2017.91"&gt;rabies&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 only weeks after his surgery in an Ohio hospital, despite having had no documented contact with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close investigation by the CDC revealed the cause: The Michigan man's donor kidney was infected by the deadly  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; – only the fourth time rabies has been transmitted via transplanted organs in the US since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, the CDC says, highlights the need for stronger guidance for transplant teams where the donor has a history of exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rabies-is-a-deadly-unpredictable-threat-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabies Is a Deadly, Unpredictable Threat. Here's How to Protect Yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral pathogen that spreads typically via the saliva of infected animals, usually through bites or scratches. Capable of infecting all mammals, including humans, the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms appear; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0711"&gt;fewer than 50&lt;/a&gt; cases of survival have been documented worldwide, with medical specialists rarely succeeding in keeping patients alive despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaf157"&gt;extreme measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt; most often occurs from dog bites, but any infected mammal can transmit the disease. The donor in this case, an Idaho man, had been found unresponsive after a presumed cardiac arrest in early December 2024, around five weeks after being scratched by a skunk in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one suspected the involvement of rabies at the time. So as the man was an organ donor, his heart, lungs, left kidney, and corneas were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five weeks after receiving the kidney, the Michigan patient developed symptoms consistent with rabies. Doctors sent samples of his saliva, skin, and other fluids to the CDC, which detected rabies virus RNA in some of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the recipient had no history of animal exposure, investigators turned back to the donor. A stored serum sample from the Idaho man tested negative for rabies  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, but an archived biopsy of his kidney was positive for rabies virus RNA, confirming the organ as the source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan recipient died on the seventh day after hospitalization, but he may have saved other lives. The donor's heart and lungs were used for training at a Maryland research facility and did not pose a risk, but three other patients had received corneal grafts from the donor's corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors immediately removed the transplanted corneas and prescribed the patients a course of highly effective Post-exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP – human rabies antibodies plus a vaccine given before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials assessed 357 possible contacts of both the donor and the kidney recipient. In total, 46 people – including healthcare workers, community contacts, and the cornea recipients – were advised to receive PEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events highlights a vulnerability in the current donor system. While the donor's risk assessment interview documented the skunk scratch, his symptoms hadn't been recognized as consistent with rabies, so his skunk encounter wasn't raised as a testable rabies risk until after the kidney recipient had died as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since rabies testing on donor organs is not routine, and no one raised any red flags, the transplants took place as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies can take weeks to months to become symptomatic after transmission.

Human peripheral blood samples (32 ml) were collected from donors in BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tubes containing Sodium Heparin/Ficoll (BD Biosciences). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation at 1600&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min at room temperature (20–22 °C), followed by three washing steps with PBS and 10% FBS (LabTech) and centrifuged at 520 RCF for 10 min after each wash.

PBMCs were subsequently stimulated with 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L2630) for 4 h (37 °C, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). For the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation experiments, human PBMCs isolated as above (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; per condition) pre-incubated with TMAO (100 μM), PF06650833 (0.5 μM) or vehicle as indicated for 30 min were then stimulated with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 79346) and 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, I0634) for 4 h. Next, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min), and supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until further use. IL-6 and TNF were measured in the media diluted 1:10 in RPMI-1640 using the DuoSet ELISA kits (R&amp;amp;D, DY206 and DY210, respectively) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For PMA/ionomycin TNF measurements, the media were undiluted.

The following day, media were discarded and cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI-1640 containing 100 μM TMA, or RPMI-1640 vehicle for 30 min. PBMCs were then stimulated with LPS (1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for up to 60 min (times indicated in the corresponding figure legends). At the end of the stimulation, PBMCs were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, F8775) at room temperature for 20 min. Phosphorylation of IRAK1 (at Thr209) or NF-κBp65 (at Ser536) was determined in fixed PBMCs using commercially available ELISA kits (LSBio, LS-F1401-1 or LS-F891-1, respectively) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Readings were normalized to the levels of total IRAK1 protein determined in sister wells, which were treated identically. The dose-dependent impact of TMA (see corresponding figures) on phosphorylation levels of IRAK1 or NF-κBp65 upon LPS (1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) stimulation of PBMCs (for 10 min or 15 min, respectively) was also determined using the commercially available kits from LSBio as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Cell-based assays in primary human hepatocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes were commercially sourced (Innoprot) and cultured with hepatocytes medium (Innoprot) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% hepatocytes growth supplement (mixture of growth factors, hormones and proteins necessary for culture of primary hepatocytes) and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and streptomycin.

In this experiment, the effect of palmitic acid and TMA on IRAK1, IRAK4, NF-κBp65, IKKαβ, SAPK/JNK and p38MAPK activity was analysed. In a second experiment, the effect of TMA (0.1 mM, 30 min) pre-treatment plus co-administration during vehicle or palmitic acid exposure for 4 h on insulin action and on IL-6 release was tested. Insulin action was evaluated by measuring p&lt;sup&gt;Ser473&lt;/sup&gt;Akt1/Akt1 after insulin (100 nM, 10 min) stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;Thr209&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK1, total IRAK1, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser536&lt;/sup&gt;NF-κBp65, total NF-κBp65, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser473&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1, total AKT1 and GAPDH (as an endogenous control) were measured with specific colourimetric cell-based ELISA Kits (Assay Biotechnology Company, CytoGlow IRAK1 (CBP1425), CytoGlow NF-κBp65 (CBP1633) and CytoGlow AKT1 (CBP1490), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For data analysis, the optical density of target proteins (read at 450 nm) was normalized with cell nuclei crystal violet staining (read at 595 nm), which was proportional to cell counts. The analysis of cell-based assays was performed in a blind manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;Thr345/Ser346&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK4/IRAK4, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser176/180&lt;/sup&gt;IKKαβ/IKKβ, p&lt;sup&gt;Thr183/Tyr185&lt;/sup&gt;SAPK/JNK and p&lt;sup&gt;Thr180/Tyr182&lt;/sup&gt;p38MAPK/p38MAPK were determined by western blot. In brief, hepatocyte proteins were directly extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cellular debris and lipids were eliminated by centrifugation of the solubilized samples at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, recovering the soluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the RC/DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). RIPA protein extracts (20 μg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by conventional procedures. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against the following proteins: p&lt;sup&gt;Thr345/Ser346&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK4 (11927), IRAK4 (4363), p&lt;sup&gt;Ser176/180&lt;/sup&gt;IKKαβ (2694), IKKβ (8943), p&lt;sup&gt;Thr183/Tyr185&lt;/sup&gt;SAPK/JNK (4668), SAPK/JNK (9258), p&lt;sup&gt;Thr180/Tyr182&lt;/sup&gt;p38MAPK (9215) and p38MAPK (9212), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and β-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence, and quantification of protein expression was performed using Scion Image software. IL-6 concentration in hepatocyte media was measured using Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;amp;D Systems, D6050). All experiments were performed with at least three sample replicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19"&gt;Mouse models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Longitudinal HFD feeding in mice&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the University of Oxford. Male mice from a C57BL/6J inbred strain were bred in our animal facility by using a stock originating from The Jackson Laboratory. At 5 weeks of age, groups of eight to ten mice were transferred to a 40% w/w HFD (65% kcal) (Special Diets Services, 824155b), containing 32% lard and 8% corn oil, whereas control groups remained on a normal carbohydrate (CHD) diet containing 5% fat, 19% protein and 3.5% fibre (B&amp;amp;K rat and mouse pelleted diet, B&amp;amp;K Universal) for up to 6 months.

For each sample, 10 μg of total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by in vitro transcription to generate biotin-labelled complementary RNA (cRNA). The cRNA samples were then assessed for yield and integrity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. After fragmentation, individual cRNA preparations were hybridized to the microarrays using a temperature-controlled Affymetrix hybridization oven. Post-hybridization washing and staining were carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Finally, the arrays were scanned at a wavelength of 560 nm with an Agilent scanner (Affymetrix).

Quantification and integrity analysis of total RNA were performed by analysing 1 µl of each sample in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 mg total RNA using a Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed with the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems) using Mesa Fast qPCR (Eurogentec) for detection according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

To analyse the insulin signalling pathway, mice were allocated to either a saline-injected subgroup or an insulin-injected subgroup so that both subgroups were matched in terms of body weight and fat mass. They then received 1 mU insulin per g body weight (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk) or an equal volume of saline solution. Then, 3 min after injection, the mice were killed and their liver was dissected. A total of 30 mg of liver was homogenized in 680 µl of RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 containing 1% BSA:p-Akt Ser473 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, 4060), total Akt (1:1,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 9272S), p-NF-κB (1:3,000; AbCam, ab86299) and total NF-κB p65 (1:3,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 8242). Insulin-induced p-Akt/total Akt corresponds to the ratio between p-Akt/Akt in insulin-treated mice and p-Akt/Akt in saline-treated mice. For these western blots, the membranes were stripped and re-probed with a β-actin antibody as a loading control. In separate densitometric analyses, we additionally corrected total Akt levels with β-actin and subsequently used this ratio to correct p-Akt, so as to take into account total protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29"&gt;

                                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A horse was euthanized in Lancaster County last month after testing positive for equine herpesvirus, an infectious disease that can be fatal for domestic horses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Equine Disease Communication Center, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture reported that three horses from an unnamed Lancaster County farm tested positive for equine herpesvirus Nov. 27. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The horses were suffering from the neurologic form of the disease, equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, which can damage the spinal cord and prove fatal. It is typically spread through particles in the air or contaminated surfaces. The disease does not affect humans; however, people can inadvertently spread the disease from one horse to another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The State Department of Agriculture reported that one horse at the Lancaster County farm had to be euthanized due to the severity of the disease. The other horses have had to undergo quarantine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Equine Disease Communication Center said it is monitoring a large number of equine herpesvirus cases connected to an outbreak that originated at a Women’s Professional Rodeo Association event in Waco, Texas, in November. So far, at least 60 cases of equine herpesvirus linked to that outbreak have been reported in eight states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cases of equine herpesvirus in Lancaster County have not been connected to the outbreak in Texas, according to the report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Pennsylvania Equine Council, signs of equine herpesvirus in an animal can include a fever of unknown origin, nasal discharge or coughing, lethargy and neurological signs such as stumbling or loss of coordination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond when contacted for additional information Sunday. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

One, two, a few, several? If you’ve taught your algorithm that you’re open to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-treatment-natural-remedy-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;alternative wellness solutions&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is likely more than zero. Perhaps you’ve been made to bear witness to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgD_LOx_5q/?igsh=bmRic3doZDdhYnR0"&gt;long, gnarly, brown ropes&lt;/a&gt; laid out on paper towels. Maybe you’ve seen a pile of what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIhAtuozWtM/?igsh=MXhld2V3a2s5eHRtZQ%3D%3D"&gt;spaghetti squash&lt;/a&gt; floating in a toilet. You may have been treated to pics of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-_wZlOJAq/?igsh=YWJpbHNrN3F0b2Zy"&gt;shriveled, dried-apricot–like bits&lt;/a&gt; harvested from a stranger’s feces. Given the many poop posts, you’d be forgiven for believing that the entire internet-using population is teeming with intestinal worms, which these posters say they’ve expelled with “parasite cleanses” before snapping a pic and slapping up a Reel or TikTok to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitatlk3001g3b78fp5ujh0w@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;Over the summer, supermodel &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/heidi-klum-parasite-cleanse-update.html"&gt;Heidi Klum&lt;/a&gt; unwittingly stoked parasite panic by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/heidi-klum-project-runway-return-routine-d0292c92"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;she was undertaking her first cleanse. “Everything I’m getting on my Instagram feed at the moment is about worms and parasites,” Klum said in the interview. “I heard that you’re supposed to do this once a year, and I’ve never done it. So I feel like I’m really behind. I don’t know what the heck is going to come out.” By November, Klum had cleansed, but the results were unclear. “So many people asked me, too, like, ‘What happened?’” she told &lt;a href="https://people.com/heidi-klum-reveals-results-worm-cleanse-exclusive-11853373"&gt;&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m like, ‘I don’t even know if anything happened!’” There had been no smoking gun, no writhing toilet of expelled creatures — but also no statement of regret. In fact, Klum exclaimed that “it just felt good,” since any parasites that might have been there “were leaving the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswc2000c3b782y5l3mv5@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;Klum had embarked on the endeavor repeating an adage often spouted by those in the cleanse community: &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; has parasites, and they just don’t know it. A common stat bandied about is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8GXs4qwrw"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; percent of the population. Wild as the figure may sound, the notion has just enough plausibility to pass many folks’ b.s. detectors. Don’t tiny, imperceptible mites live on our eyelashes? Don’t dogs get worms, scooting their butts on the carpet for relief? Is it then so crazy to think that wriggling menaces may have colonized our colons, too? Toss in the ardent proselytizing of online “experts” and those eye-popping photos, and you can see how someone might be swayed. It also doesn’t hurt that cleanses are made to seem “natural,” almost spa-like, consisting of earthy stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z8OQGW/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B004Z8OQGW&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=7JegY&amp;amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=6KPVXF5QRJN01398T2RC&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=3F7kw&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=0c0d1fdb-5bee-4c2e-ba3a-5d1ec68e16ff&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;black walnut, wormwood, clove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Cleanse-Tincture-Wormwood-Burdock/dp/B0DYDFHTF1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;burdock root&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Advanced-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B078NCFVVJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=27PCYLMKMUKHC&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wYdlgiKKHJg2VkdNBBYI0w-zh4UHUI-lVfekSxUs-YY4ORxdPEXkc4YmqF_49QOgnnlQHOYkfl7fVd64TPCJW5jIHpzBlv3eysd_uHA6rsli1iJZGHg4TGX7FuAPpQMrIdXfHgarnOzZ6yHaIb4IJxABR6oykJY03_vGDV2ycV6MQVD1BNxNDlGc2X13QeaNwhwHLIGCy9svUMx2ykF482ucP6zRcwnXbYS1E4RnuCV9Y_uRWXI0hEBAmOKozcxAy2oRBafe_br3Beo0Y9p1OIsxAbsEmypirC1YQs62_F4.YhXy1H9ugtPt4SkwftJj1VwVUjUJ-tyjrLz_B988TwQ&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Bfor%2Bhumans&amp;amp;qid=1763860877&amp;amp;s=hpc&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Chpc%2C100&amp;amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But trying to dissuade cleanse believers often only deepens their conviction. Disavowal by the medical community is viewed not as scientific sensemaking but as, at best, dogmatic myopia, and at worst, evidence of a shady allegiance to Big Pharma — a desire to keep you sick so they can sell you bogus cures. As is true of many facets of American life these days, parasite mania seems to be a disagreement between two realities: one in which the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;medical Establishment is the utmost health authority (or at least it was until recently), and one in which &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; care is purveyed by the truth tellers this same Establishment shuns.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s more complicated than, say, vaccine hesitancy, in which one side is demonstrably correct and the other side refuses to believe it. With intestinal worms, we face a paradoxical truth: They are both less common and more common than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswj7000g3b788jnj1z5k@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“A lot of the people who feel they are infected with parasites are not,” says Dr. Daniel Griffin, a clinical instructor of medicine and infectious-disease specialist at Columbia and president of &lt;a href="https://parasiteswithoutborders.com/our-mission/"&gt;Parasites Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, an advocacy organization dedicated to addressing global parasitic illness. “But the other side,” he continues, “is that people out there actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; having issues related to parasites but are not being diagnosed.” The double-edged sword of parasitic infection is that its symptoms — diarrhea, bloating, nausea, gas — are common enough that one could attribute them to anything from indigestion to a hangover, but these symptoms are also common enough that, if someone told you everyone has worms and you believed them, those symptoms might be enough to convince you that you have them, too. Ask a roomful of people if they’ve had diarrhea, bloating, nausea, or gas in the last month, and 90 percent are likely to raise their hand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswkq000h3b78w4umiswm@published" data-word-count="171"&gt;Parasites Without Borders’ work makes clear that the scope of the problem varies by region. A &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the global population has some form of intestinal worm, known as a helminth, though that jumps to as high as 50 percent in tropical and subtropical regions. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Most&lt;/a&gt; helminths spread via human feces, especially in places where people defecate outside; when feces contains worm eggs, the soil it touches becomes contaminated, and if that soil is used to grow food, the parasite spreads. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Hookworms and strongyloides&lt;/a&gt;, however, can latch onto a host through the soles of their feet if walked on barefoot; tapeworms and trichinella can enter your body through undercooked meat; and flukes can be caught by ingesting contaminated water or fish. The most common global helminth is &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;, a roundworm that affects 1 billion people worldwide. While helminths are generally not deadly, if allowed to proliferate, some can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;bowel obstruction, inflammation, and chronic malnutrition&lt;/a&gt; in children; if the host is pregnant, some worms can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;detrimental&lt;/a&gt; to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;

Pinworms live in the digestive tract and can be diagnosed using the “tape test”: After the suspected host falls asleep, pinworms venture out to lay eggs, and a piece of tape is placed on the anus to capture them. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21137-pinworms"&gt;Two doses of an anti-parasitic&lt;/a&gt; and a load of laundry later (to rid bedsheets and clothes of eggs), the host is cured. But treatment requires diagnosis, and hosts don’t always know they have pinworms — around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6522669/#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20have%20also%20been,seek%20medical%20advice%20(4)."&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; percent of cases are asymptomatic. Even if symptoms are present, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Parasitology/comments/1behxom/did_my_pinworms_really_dissapear_by_themselves/"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.pinworms-care-instructions.ut3181"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; may be too embarrassed to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

They can be hostile. Most doctors, to be honest, will put delusional parasitosis at the top of their differential, and things just go south from there.” In other words, even if you’re right, telling a GP you have worms and refusing to entertain other possibilities might get you written off as just another internet faddist or maybe even someone with a mental-health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswq6000k3b78b8yo8vkd@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Delusional parasitosis is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541021/#:~:text=Delusions%20of%20parasitosis%20is%20a,primary%20presentation%20or%20secondary%20presentation."&gt;usually secondary&lt;/a&gt; to another psychiatric condition, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and while recorded cases are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6861047/"&gt;exceedingly rare&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated that many people with the condition go undiagnosed since they don’t visit a mental-health professional to discuss it. Instead, because they are certain they have a parasite, they see a medical doctor. “You can imagine how challenging that can be for many physicians,” says &lt;a href="https://manhattancbt.com/paul-greene-phd/"&gt;Paul Greene&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Manhattan Center for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, who has expertise in health anxiety. “They have to rule out the presence of parasites, but they’re really dealing with a psychiatric condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

To the wide, unregulated, FDA-unapproved world of parasite cleanses, sold on Amazon, on Etsy, and by countless independent cleanse purveyors. While it’s difficult to gauge exactly how many people use them, Amazon reviews give some indication: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Digestive-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B016LBZSDK/ref=sr_1_9?crid=8UWUS5TVYSG0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TjZyHd6WUmsyC_ZhdTaJ5AA6gmGZNtIRxUTlu1RjDMgYWq1nsnt2h3bls-YZJXI5HcxaXeYEc9TLRs3udtHQJ9lgNyBvvZf9xaymnokZ-qUk9kekeKMpuxtPmlzl1aRQIRukcm5giHG4UPAtEQrvcpEP-umJz7MSmwZovYm82XytqqORIHWGL_9atoMMXzlEGvc9KrLrFdyYRm2AihJfnLZGkXE5boZy3xvkMWmvWcukg8a1vNWB0oC3q5KgIBfMAuzLOITe90rjrV6ZO8CQFR_4FAEut1tITcWXLTH-NKE.f-zwkLpvOr3bfZhzxStDLJ-FIQ1VhSNOR0ponF-_h-4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse&amp;amp;qid=1764078199&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Caps%2C146&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;ParaGuard&lt;/a&gt; ($29.90), one of the most popular options, had 30,451 reviews at press time. Interestingly, some of these clearly parasite-invoking options don’t actually use the word &lt;em&gt;parasite&lt;/em&gt; in their product descriptions, most likely because the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/questions-and-answers-health-claims-food-labeling"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; supplement manufacturers from making medical claims related to treating disease. Many people, however, opt for cleanses they read about in online testimonials or hear about via word of mouth — which is precisely how Shannon Nesbitt, of Kauai, found her favorite cleanse, &lt;a href="https://www.thesanctuaryholisticwellness.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor4YE9VCG3-NPwnNdgV8b8NwdTa99vkZlvqs8KAhlyqZ0g03_jg"&gt;Sanctuary Holistic Wellness&lt;/a&gt; ($377). “My friend did it,” says Nesbitt, who is 55, “and she’s vegan, and she had all these worms come out — so I figured if she has them, I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have them.” Nesbitt suffered from constipation and, after her friend’s experience, wondered if parasites might be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

It was recommended that the cleanse be conducted around the time of a full moon. The psyllium husk was to be taken only with Concord grape juice. One day, Nesbitt ingested a mixture of olive oil, ruby-red grapefruit juice, and Epsom salts before lying on one side, per the instructions; this was to purge gallstones, and she says she passed hundreds the following day. Then there were the worms: “I was surprised,” Nesbitt says. “There were these big, long, white worms, and a lot of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/liver-fluke"&gt;liver flukes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

A cleanse isn’t a onetime medical treatment so much as a long-term self-care routine.&lt;/p&gt;

I messaged her to talk. She replied, but I was confused when she referred me to her husband, Christian — until it turned out that he isn’t just a fellow fan of parasite cleanses but actually recommends them as part of his health-coaching business, &lt;a href="https://www.healingunited.today/home"&gt;Healing United&lt;/a&gt;, which he runs alongside his business partner, a primary-care doctor in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

And you kind of go, &lt;em&gt;If that’s in me, maybe it’s not the only one&lt;/em&gt;.” Elliot went to a naturopath, where he underwent two stool tests that came back negative for parasites; still, he tried her worm protocol. “I couldn’t make it all the way,” he says. “It was two weeks of suffering. I was in so much pain from the die-off.” (In the cleanse world, this refers to an extinction burst of toxins released as parasites and bacteria gradually die inside of you.) Another cleanse he tried induced “one hot-fire bowel movement, but no worms came out that I could see.”&lt;/p&gt;

He turned to the practitioners he’d been working with at Healing United, which, he says, was initially founded as a means of detoxing people injured by COVID vaccines. (Other topics Elliot touched on during our chat: chemtrails, changing the MMR vaccine schedule, and the potential dangers of fluoride.) Ultimately, Elliot and his team landed on a complex program of tinctures, herbs, fiber, “binders” (a material that attaches to dying parasites’ toxins to help flush them out, like clay), and three weeks of daily enemas. He says the results are startling. “I had a client two weeks ago who told me, ‘I just passed what looked like a bowl full of angel-hair pasta.’” Elliot says he himself passed “a bowlful” of pinworms (is a bowl the standard unit of worm measurement?), along with many red, marble-size liver flukes.&lt;/p&gt;

Turpentine, castor oil, these are wildly effective at poisoning. Tapeworms especially don’t like turpentine; they hate it.” He also mentions the benefits of clay, charcoal, and a half-dozen essential oils.&lt;/p&gt;

While he concedes that emergency services and trauma care are worthwhile uses of traditional medicine, he’s philosophically opposed to its other applications. “It sounds hyperbolic, but it’s anti-human. It’s symptom, symptom, symptom. ‘Don’t bother me with why this is happening, I just want to treat your symptom,’ which leads to another symptom and another. The model of pharmaceuticals is chemical intervention, and they’re trying to figure out how much poison they can give you without giving you a side effect or killing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

(A recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DND8NkEMQFj/?igsh=MXU0cnFpeWM1ZmdpMQ%3D%3D"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; was titled “Parasite Cleanses are Not a Real Thing,” with the caption, “I cannot believe how y’all want to waste your money with these online grifters.”) When we speak, I tell her about turpentine enemas.&lt;/p&gt;

And if I did that cleanse and got really sick, that person is not going to take any responsibility for me because they’re not a medical professional. They don’t see the end result of what they’re doing.” (The website of Elliot’s company mentions that “a doctor and a coach” are available for “Code Red” calls should any unpleasant symptoms arise — but nowhere does it recommend simply going to the ER if a Code Red situation should occur.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxzs00133b78893np9v1@published" data-word-count="169"&gt;“Mucus,” Wallace says. “Undigested food. Intestinal lining. You ever notice how none of the ‘worms’ are moving?” Dr. Griffin told me something similar — that sloughed-off bits of intestine and fibrous vegetables that don’t get fully broken down can look like worms, provided you don’t know what worms look like. None of the photos he’s seen online or unsolicited specimens he’s viewed in person show segments on the worms, which is characteristic of tapeworms, and he’s yet to see any that are moving, the way pinworms would be. The Mayo Clinic also has an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/expert-answers/gallbladder-cleanse/faq-20058134#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20a%20gallbladder,below%20and%20resubmit%20the%20form."&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; for those hundreds of “gallstones” Nesbitt passed: Because most gallstone cleanses involve olive oil, what cleansers are seeing is just globs of “oil, juice, and other materials.” Wallace continues, “Normal people are not passing these things; it’s likely a result of the cleanse — just not in the way they think. Not to mention that half the time online they don’t show a picture of what came out; they just &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; it came out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy2u00153b78i7s781r2@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Griffin had an answer for this: “Possibly because the cleanse has accidentally corrected a dysbiosis,” he says, referring to an imbalance of microorganisms in the gut. “In their head, they think, &lt;em&gt;I feel better because I treated my parasite&lt;/em&gt;. The reality is they might feel better because they’ve improved their microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;

They want to use it for COVID, for cancer. It’s like, this is its time to shine, people.” (Ivermectin’s star turn began during the pandemic, when a rash of skeptics began using the dewormer, which is generally used in livestock, to treat COVID against the advice of doctors.) When Wallace says “they,” she seems to mean some variation on &lt;em&gt;people who don’t trust science&lt;/em&gt;. Without ever mentioning them by name, I get the feeling that we’re talking about adherents to and peddlers within the MAHA movement, who, alongside their own legitimately worm-bedeviled leader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., believe they’ll Make America Healthy Again.&lt;/p&gt;

But that really doesn’t matter to these people. They go off personal narrative and appeal to emotion. And that’s effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

Surely others are fed up with America’s exploitive medical industrial complex and are looking for a way around it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy8l00193b78r87ra042@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;“I think some of it is distrust of the health-care system,” says Wallace, seeming to intuit my thoughts, “and this idea that doctors just want to make money by peddling pharmaceuticals. But if you see a doctor for an anti-parasitic, yes, the visit might cost money, but you’d take a couple doses of generic medication. Whereas if you go on Instagram and buy months of this regimen, that’s way more money.” Wallace also acknowledges that internet medicine may be the only kind some people can access: “Maybe they don’t have insurance, so these wellness fads are something they do in lieu of going to the doctor. They think they’re really doing something good.” Or maybe there are, as she says, “just a lot of fringe ideas online. I mean, there’s a whole Facebook group for people who drink urine for health reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;

We’re told constantly that our bodies are full of things we can’t see: forever chemicals, microplastics, phthalates, Bisphenol A, mercury, lead. We don’t know where our food comes from; it just shows up in the grocery store in a way that feels both mundane and sinister. Who touched it on its way there? &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; touched it? I ask Griffin what he thinks about it all. What would possess someone to believe they were crawling with worms?&lt;/p&gt;

                Research shows our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age, because of changes in metabolism.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a drink or two at a holiday party went down the hatch with no problems. Now, it's a recipe for misery the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Christmas&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Chicago Medicine says it's a common lament as people enter middle age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You are not alone," Christmas says. "I am in that age range too and absolutely, [drinks] need to be spread out or it's all going to go straight to my head and I will need to sleep half the day away the next day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are physiological explanations for why our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age.  For one thing,&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18090653/" target="_blank"&gt;  studies show &lt;/a&gt;the liver enzymes that break down alcohol become less efficient. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That means that our bodies metabolize alcohol a little bit differently," she says. "We also lose more muscle as we get older, and that muscle is replaced by fatty tissue."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That's important, because muscle stores water and that water dilutes alcohol in our blood, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3542/johannes-thrul" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Thrul&lt;/a&gt;, an alcohol and substance abuse researcher and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He says having less muscle mass means alcohol will hang around in our bodies longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What this means is that the same drink that previously maybe felt just fine now leads to a higher blood alcohol level," Thrul says. "You feel the effects for longer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These changes happen to both men and women as they enter middle age. But for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5398547/perimenopause-menopause-symptoms-hrt-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;women in perimenopause,&lt;/a&gt; alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms that come with hormonal fluctuations — like mood swings and irritability, says Christmas, who directs the Menopause Program and Center for Women's Integrated Health at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol already is known to be a depressant," she says. "It can all also increase baseline anxiety symptoms. Alcohol can disrupt sleep too. If you're already experiencing all of those symptoms, it's just that much more compounded."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While worse hangovers as you age might not seem like a good thing, think of it as your body nudging you in the right direction. Cutting back is a good idea, says &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/kenneth-koncilja/4269493" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ken Koncilja&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician with the Cleveland Clinic, because the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5245794/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;risks of drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt; increase with age. That includes an&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; increased risk of cancer, &lt;/a&gt;liver disease, worsened high blood pressure, memory problems and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol use can cause dementia," he says. It can also interfere with many medications and lead to balance problems and more falls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Koncilja says he makes it a point to discuss the benefits of cutting back with his patients. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These conversations about alcohol use — being proactive in people with people in their 50s and 60s — has a huge impact on their health and wellbeing when they're in their 80s and 90s," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Johannes Thrul of Johns Hopkins says many people don't realize that alcohol is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/not-just-a-hangover--the-surgeon-generals-advisory-on-alcohol-and-cancer-risk.h00-159776445.html" target="_blank"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; — in the same category as tobacco and asbestos. "Every drink you have essentially increases your cancer risk for multiple types of cancer," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thrul says while the healthiest option is to not drink at all, even small changes to cut back can offer health benefits. For example, during holiday parties, he says try alternating alcoholic drinks with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/09/nx-s1-5251653/looking-to-have-fun-without-alcohol-this-guy-has-ideas-that-may-help" target="_blank"&gt;mocktails or other non-alcoholic options&lt;/a&gt;. And make sure to drink plenty of water to help your body metabolize the alcohol you do imbibe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Why don't you just give it a try and see how it feels?" Thrul says. "Because you might be surprised how good it actually is when you sleep better, you have less anxiety the next day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says your body will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

It's fairly uniform in colour, the surface looks smooth, there’s no abnormal growth or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/inflammation" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; there,” he explained. But cancer doesn’t start suddenly it, begins with tiny, harmless-looking polyps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We think that most cancers in the colon start off as little polyps or growths. They can start off super small, but if left in your colon long enough, they tend to get bigger and bigger,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the years, that small polyp can become significantly larger. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;After a few years, that small polyp can start looking like this,” he added, showing how it grows into a large mass that begins to interfere with normal bowel function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How do polyps turn into colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these growths expand, they can cause several symptoms. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to Dr Salhab, “It starts causing problems like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/laparoscopic-surgeon-warns-women-not-to-ignore-abdominal-pain-reveals-5-serious-health-issues-it-could-indicate-101757230928239.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="abdominal pain"&gt;abdominal pain&lt;/a&gt;, bleeding, a change in bowel habits resulting in constipation or more frequent bowel movements because the stool is trying to make its way past it and you’re not really emptying your colon the way you should.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news? When discovered early, these polyps are completely treatable. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The key is to catch it when it’s small like this because it’s easily removable and curable, and it will never turn into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/cancer" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; once it’s removed,” he emphasised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gastroenterologists can remove these polyps during a routine colonoscopy, often during the same appointment in which they’re discovered. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;We have tools we can use in the colonoscopy to turn something like this and remove it, and we can close up the little cut after we remove it, and then your colon is as good as new,” Dr Salhab explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

Multivitamins have quietly become part of our daily lives and rituals, as they’re an easy way to get one’s fill of important vitamins to support their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this habit isn’t for no reason at all — multivitamins do provide a combination of essential vitamins and minerals to fill nutritional gaps when diet alone isn't enough, acting as "nutritional insurance" for overall health, energy, and immune support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top Supplements for Men's Health Over 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do these pills really make a difference — or are we all popping them for nothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve often asked this ourselves when we haven’t gotten visible results despite sticking to our routine. But no more — new research from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/multivitamins-improve-memory-and-slow-cognitive-aging" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; gives clearer, evidence-based answers. The findings of the research suggest that daily multivitamins are not a universal “health fix,” but they may offer real benefits in specific groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who all fall in those groups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the new research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recently published set of studies under the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS), researchers analyzed data from over 5,000 older adults and found evidence that a daily multivitamin may help slow cognitive aging and preserve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the COSMOS-Clinic subcohort — 573 participants who underwent detailed in-person cognitive assessments over two years — showed modest but statistically significant benefits in global cognition and episodic memory for those taking multivitamins compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combining results with two other arms of the trial (which used telephone- and web-based cognitive testing), the meta-analysis confirmed consistent benefits across all three studies. On average, daily multivitamin use was associated with a “slowing” of cognitive aging by around two years compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So what does that mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, older individuals who took a multivitamin performed slightly better on memory tests and had a slower decline in overall cognition over a period of 2–3 years compared to those taking a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts involved in the study note that the findings are “exciting,” suggesting a multivitamin could be an accessible, affordable way to support brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits the most from multivitamins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the new findings of the aforementioned study, multivitamins appear most useful for older adults, particularly those whose diets may be lacking or whose bodies might not absorb nutrients as efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/daily-multivitamin-may-improve-memory-in-older-adults/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;earlier trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 3,500 adults aged over 60 found memory improvements after a year of daily multivitamin use. The multivitamin effect was strongest among the participants with existing cardiovascular disease, which implied that underlying health conditions or nutritional deficits may make the supplement more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, experts suggest that in older age, factors like reduced absorption, less varied diet, or underlying health concerns may contribute to mild micronutrient deficiencies, which might make supplements even more useful than for younger, healthy adults eating balanced diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, multivitamins are likely to help when there’s a genuine need — primarily age-related or diet-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily, if you are 60 or older, or worried about memory or cognitive aging, especially if you don’t eat a very balanced diet, a daily multivitamin could offer small but meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, if your diet is already rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and essential nutrients, the added benefit of a multivitamin may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: think of multivitamins as a supplement instead of treating them as a substitute. Rather, focus first on diet quality, physical activity, mental stimulation, and overall healthy living. However, if you decide to take multivitamins, make sure to choose a well-balanced supplement (covering essential vitamins and minerals), and consult a healthcare professional beforehand — especially if you have existing health conditions or take other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>7种常见的对肾脏有害的常规食物，以及应该吃什么-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/7-commonly-consumed-regular-foods-that-are-harmful-for-the-kidneys-and-what-to-eat-instead/photostory/125831737.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news-stories/10-common-habits-may-harm-your-kidneys"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, sugar contributes to obesity. Obesity can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure and diabetes, the two leading causes of kidney disease. As per a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439375/"&gt;PMC study&lt;/a&gt;, sugar consumption, especially in the form of fructose, has been hypothesized to cause kidney disease. It links excessive sugar intake, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), to higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk through mechanisms like elevated uric acid, obesity, diabetes, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healthy Alternatives: &lt;/b&gt;Dates, jaggery, dhaga mishri, and fruits like mango, chikoo, banana, or custard apple make for a healthier option to try. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:47:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>流感来得早，病例比去年增加了五倍-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/flu-comes-early-and-hits-hard-with-five-times-more-cases-than-last-year/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Amid a sharp rise in flu cases around the country that has seen &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/six-year-old-boy-dies-of-flu-complications-in-second-case-this-week/"&gt;three children die&lt;/a&gt; from complications of the disease, the Health Ministry’s Epidemic Control Team called an emergency meeting late Sunday night to discuss possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of the flu in Israel has started earlier this year, and is five times greater than during the same period last year, the Ynet news site reported, citing figures from Maccabi Healthcare Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, about 25 percent of PCR samples for respiratory viruses tested positive for Influenza A, compared to 5% last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The report said that in the week ending November 29, the Center for Disease Control recorded 394 new Influenza A cases in 14 hospitals. Children accounted for 163 of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, two babies were hospitalized in critical condition at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, with one being ventilated. At Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center, a toddler was also placed on a life-support system due to complications from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Flu comes early and hits hard, with five times more cases than last year"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The report also noted a steep rise in Influenza A among preschool-age children (ages 3 to 6) in November, with 59% of those tested for respiratory viruses found testing positive for that strain of the flu. Among school-age children (ages 6 to 18), about 50% of tests were positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Influenza A(H3N2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant subtype of this year’s influenza is A(H3N2). Infected people may experience symptoms such as fever, coughing, and sore throat, similar to those of other types of flu; however, A(H3N2) strains can lead to more severe respiratory problems and be fatal in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization reported that Influenza A continues to increase worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A woman gets her flu vaccine shot on September 5, 2023. (Clalit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, less than 15% of people in Israeli healthcare funds have been vaccinated against seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the children who died of the flu over the past two weeks had not received flu vaccinations, while one had received a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Prof. Ariel Tenenbaum, head of Hadassah’s pediatric department, urged people to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine will prevent children from being in a life-threatening condition,” Tenenbaum said.&lt;/p&gt;

It beats in rhythm with the world around us.” Here’s an exclusive interview:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this recognition from the American Heart Association mean to you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a great privilege, a very distinguished recognition of the work. To be selected amongst thousands of cardiologists every year is a unique privilege. I'm delighted, but equally delighted for what this means for the area of science that I'm involved in. It recognizes the work linked to science research, but also to translational research- the underpinning of whatever we do in cardiology. It's evidence-based. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The recognition is really an acknowledgment of the science that goes into decision making in the area of cardiology and a link between the work that I've done in the environment space.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;A lot of it is underpinned by the fact that we use research methodology to succumb to conclusions about the world around us, as well as the world within us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can you elaborate on the impact of environmental risk factors, specifically air pollution on cardiovascular diseases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is the second leading cause of global mortality right after hypertension which is the leading cause. It doesn't include any other environmental variable. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Just the math of this means that if you add together all the known knowns, and we know very little about environmental risk factors, then that's a part of it that really should be a clarion call for waking up, particularly in India, which is in the crosshairs of multiple environmental exposures.&lt;/span&gt; Air pollution is singularly the most important problem that we currently face and are going to face in the years to come. More than 60% of deaths attributable to air pollution are those that have led to cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When examined in that lens of why this is important for the subcontinent, it is a massive and a very important actionable area of health. Everyone’s entitled to good, clean air, clean water, and clean food. There should be an unmitigated attempt to curb exposure to air pollution, particularly in vulnerable communities, such as children. Early exposure during childhood causes permanent damage to your lung capacity or sets you up for future problems. Since it’s not a problem that individuals can solve alone, it's changes at policy and governmental level that are vital. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In light of the fact that this is such a humongous human tragedy, there needs to be a no-tolerance policy, and all hands on deck in terms of solving the problem.&lt;/span&gt; Also, air pollution costs India enormously. The economic ramifications in terms of sick days, hospitalisations and deaths are massive on a productivity frontier too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s your involvement at policy level?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I have helped position the US policy as part of the committee called the scientific advisory committee (SAC) and the Environmental Protection Agency, which formulates climate policy.&lt;/span&gt; I collaborate with researchers to try to come up with useful experiments or quasi-natural experiments that could inform or guide policy. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I would be delighted to be engaged in any capacity with the Indian government, as I care deeply about the environment, particularly in parts of the world where policy actions or changes could have a significant impact on population health.&lt;/span&gt; The biggest point of convergence that shouldn't take any convincing for everybody is children's health. I hope that children's health is a rallying cry for people to unite in their opposition to anything detrimental to kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the most prevalent risk factors of CVD?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading cause of mortality and death worldwide is hypertension. Cardiovascular diseases have overtaken cancers as the leading cause of global mortality. One of the reasons for that is a growing epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. India, unfortunately, is the grand center for diabetes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is because of an incredible transition, both in terms of transitioning to nutrient heavy foods, changes in dietary patterns, changes in physical activity, densely populated cities that provide little room for recreation, lack of exercise, lack of education, and a profound shift and appetite, and the way people eat.&lt;/span&gt; It's just a massive problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US is no different. We are seeing a tsunami of obesity and diabetes. Smoking rates have gone down, but there's been an uptick in practices like vaping. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and elevation in LDL cholesterol, are driving heart disease globally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to reduce CVD and live long with a healthy heart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To stem or reduce cardiovascular disease prevalence, there needs to be paid to address not just the risk factors, but also primordial prevention- referring to an area where you don't allow these risk factors to begin in the first place.&lt;/span&gt; For example, to prevent the onset of hypertension or diabetes. And that really begins at the kindergarten level with education. It should be a huge priority from childhood. Also, educating families and how they feed their kids, what they consume in school and physical activity. You build good habits like physical exercises in school. It should be mandatory. People should understand that good food is about intelligent choices. Like a transition from eating a carbohydrate-rich diet to a protein rich diet. That should be the real focus because in the long run, that's the most cost effective way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association has a big push on primordial prevention. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you sleep well, do good physical activity, don't smoke, control hypertension, eat a good diet and are not obese- that should give you a fairly good lifespan and healthspan.&lt;/span&gt; It’s a good recipe for longevity in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Any next generation therapies for CVD and any innovative approaches for imaging.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;We are at a very interesting crossroads in medicine- at a confluence of artificial intelligence and genetic technologies, which are really going to redefine the era of medicine.&lt;/span&gt; Diseases that would have, essentially, relegated you to premature death, with no options are now becoming curable. There are some cardiac conditions, like amyloidosis that can now be completely solved. But these are expensive treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a larger population perspective, the previous century practices work best like eating less, walking more, and eating more plant based foods. I would say, these are the three fundamental requisites for good cardiovascular health. Prevent yourself from getting to be a diabetic, obese, and hypertensive. These are all connected risk factors that can be solved by healthy dietary practices and exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to offset the genetic predisposition that South Asians face?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetically speaking we are all the same. The genome is 99.5% or more similar. What's different is the genetic environment interactions-meaning the epigenomic responses or the responses to environmental triggers. For instance, if a South Asian is exposed to a high fat diet, they respond very differently than somebody in Europe or China. This is the epigenomic framework, where genes are expressed differently based on the environment you are placed in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anything that you might like to add on the young people, getting more cardiovascular diseases than was earlier seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s very tragic and not based on traditional risk factors. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is where I think there should be a lot of attention on setting up a large registry of such patients where we are able to collect tissue samples, bio-bank specimens, and a very detailed history on patients.&lt;/span&gt; I believe that environmental exposures of these patients might be very important. What might be singularly different about these patients might be an increase in environmental exposures. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;There are many parts of India, as well as in North America, that have high exposure to lead, cadmium, arsenic, and other toxic metals, as well as chemicals and large amounts of plastic, which are ubiquitous and all around you.&lt;/span&gt; This is compounded by profound, high levels of air pollution. In conjunction with other risk factors, this can be very dangerous. It's a huge problem, very unbelievably disturbing. When you're at the peak of your livelihood, it’s medically and economically catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The duvet is pulled neatly into place, the pillows are arranged with care, and the perfectly made bed becomes a symbol of order and discipline. Across generations, this simple act has been encouraged as a marker of responsibility, productivity, and self-control. From military training to parenting advice and bestselling self-help books, making the bed has been framed as a small but meaningful accomplishment that sets the tone for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, emerging research suggests that this universally accepted habit may be hiding an unexpected drawback. While it appears harmless and even beneficial, it could be creating conditions that quietly undermine your respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

With more people spending extended time at home, conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinus issues are increasingly being linked to pollutants and allergens inside the home. Bedrooms, where people spend roughly a third of their lives, are especially important in this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the traditional practice of making the bed every morning takes an unexpected turn. A growing body of scientific evidence highlights how tightly made bedding may be fostering an environment ideal for dust mite survival. A widely discussed study conducted at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/about/news/messy-bedroom-could-spell-end-for-creepy-crawlies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kingston University in the United Kingdom &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;revealed that leaving your bed unmade during the day could significantly reduce dust mite populations. Led by environmental building scientist Dr Stephen Pretlove, the research examined how heat and moisture trapped in bedding influence dust mite growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A freshly made bed traps the warmth and humidity generated during sleep. These conditions allow dust mites, which feed on dead skin cells, to thrive. When the bed is left unmade, with sheets exposed to airflow and natural evaporation, moisture levels fall and the microclimate becomes less favourable for mite survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Pretlove noted, allowing a bed to remain open during the day helps moisture evaporate from the mattress and bedding materials. This creates an environment that disrupts dust mite activity and reduces their ability to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why dust mites pose a serious health concern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dust mites are among the most common indoor allergens worldwide. Although invisible to the naked eye, their waste particles can trigger a variety of allergic reactions. Symptoms may range from mild nasal irritation and sneezing to more significant respiratory issues, particularly in people with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/dust-mites" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, bedding and pillows are some of the most concentrated sources of dust mite allergens in the home. An average bed may host up to 1.5 million mites, creating a continual source of allergen exposure night after night. Reducing dust mite levels is therefore crucial for households with asthma sufferers, young children, older adults, or individuals with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden link between bed-making habits and dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that a tidy bed equates to a cleaner sleeping environment. In reality, the opposite may be true. When you sleep, your body releases moisture through sweat and respiration. The average adult emits roughly one litre of fluid each night. If you immediately make the bed in the morning, this moisture becomes trapped under layers of sheets, blankets, and duvets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With limited ventilation, particularly during colder months when windows remain closed, this trapped moisture creates a warm and humid microclimate ideal for dust mite survival and reproduction. Indoor heating systems further complicate the issue by drying the air outside the bedding while leaving the inside warm and insulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies, including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasise the importance of reducing humidity and improving airflow to control indoor allergens. However, few people consider how their bed-making routine influences these environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bed-making tips that help control dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts do not suggest abandoning cleanliness or household routines. Instead, they recommend a more thoughtful approach to bed-making. Rather than immediately arranging your bedding after waking, allow the sheets and mattress to air out for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull back the duvet, open the windows if possible, and leave the bed exposed to moving air. This helps disperse moisture, lowers humidity, and reduces the hospitable environment that dust mites rely on. Of course, this practice should complement other hygienic habits such as washing bedding every one to two weeks in hot water, vacuuming the mattress regularly, and using dust-mite-resistant covers on pillows and mattresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing importance of indoor air quality in multi use bedrooms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern lifestyles have blurred the boundaries between living, working, and sleeping spaces. With more people using bedrooms for multiple activities, the quality of the indoor environment matters more than ever. Allowing your bed to breathe is a low-cost, practical step that can improve air quality and reduce allergen levels. It is not about rejecting cleanliness but about adapting an old habit to align with new scientific understanding. The tradition of making the bed every morning has been deeply ingrained for generations. Yet as research continues to highlight the importance of indoor air quality, small adjustments to this habit could have meaningful benefits for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bed unmade for a few hours allows natural airflow to do what it does best. It dries the bedding, disrupts the activity of dust mites, and creates a healthier sleeping environment. By rethinking this everyday ritual, you may be reducing an invisible risk that has quietly affected millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬对毛毯的热爱是您从未见过的- DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/198488-golden-retriever-blanket-video</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs love every little thing they own. Once they fall in love with something, there is no way they would ever leave it. The same can be seen in this clip shared by a dog owner. Here, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Trooper is seen wagging his tail with delight at the sight of his favorite blanket. The hilarious video left viewers in splits, and people commented on how cute the dog is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-loves-his-blankie-a-bit-too-much-in-adorable-video"&gt;Golden Retriever loves his blankie a bit too much in adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think dogs love only their toys, think again, as this specific video proves otherwise. In a video shared by @trooperatdavidcorrycars, Trooper the Golden Retriever can’t contain his excitement when he sees his favorite blankie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video begins with Trooper heading toward a room, wagging his tail enthusiastically. He gets happier as his human wraps a blanket around him. The fur baby then grabs a toy and snuggles into the blanket, happily playing with it. A hilarious moment shows him entering a room with his eyes covered by the blanket and bonking his head on the wall. Even as the ladies pet him, he refuses to &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/191062-doberman-blankie-dog-instagram-video"&gt;leave his blanket&lt;/a&gt; for a second. His constantly wagging tail perfectly shows how happy he is with his favorite thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post’s caption jokingly talks about the little head bump the dog had, stating, “Might have to take a trip to the service department for that head bump”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video left viewers amused, and many shared their heartfelt reactions in the comments. Most viewers talked about how the dog bonked his head on the wall, with one saying, “I almost heard the little whoops as he bonked the wall”. Meanwhile, others couldn’t stop praising the dog’s fun antics, calling him “cute” and “adorable” as his tail wagged nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
