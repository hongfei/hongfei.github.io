&lt;p&gt;The news just keeps getting worse for “forever chemicals.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These man-made substances — designed to repel oil, water and stains — can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;thousands of everyday items&lt;/a&gt;, from nonstick pans and fast-food wrappers to waterproof jackets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have already linked them to a laundry list of health problems, including &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/usc-study-shows-how-pfas-disrupt-healthy-function-in-human-liver-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;liver damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/exposure-to-pfas-associated-with-increased-blood-lipids-possible-cvd-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/21/inescapable-forever-chemicals-hurt-pregnancy-odds-warning-to-women/"&gt;fertility troubles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/health/forever-chemicals-may-triple-risk-of-infant-death-new-study/"&gt;birth defects&lt;/a&gt; and several types of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/forever-chemicals-linked-to-liver-cancer-in-first-human-study/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forever chemicals don’t break down easily, accumulating in the environment and the human body over time.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;luchschenF – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025007445?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that people exposed to two major environmental toxins — perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — are more likely to be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, or MS. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chronic autoimmune disease attacks the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including numbness, muscle weakness, trouble walking, vision problems, extreme fatigue, pain and cognitive difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“People with the highest concentrations of PFOS and PCBs had approximately twice as high odds of being diagnosed with MS, compared with those with the lowest concentrations,” Kim Kultima, who led the study, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-exposure-pfas-pcbs-linked-higher.html#goog_rewarded" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that forever chemicals can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105018118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interfere with the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, either weakening it or sending it into overdrive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That immune disruption has been tied to autoimmune diseases beyond MS, including &lt;a href="https://www.jrheum.org/content/52/Suppl_1/123" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12170615/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11209830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Difficulty walking is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of multiple sclerosis. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Kultima and her team analyzed blood samples from 900 people in Sweden recently diagnosed with MS and compared them with samples from people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured toxin levels in each group, then used statistical models to see how strongly chemical exposure lined up with the odds of developing MS. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because people are typically exposed to multiple chemicals at once, the team also looked at how combined exposure affected their risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could then see that an increase in total exposure was linked to higher odds of MS, even after adjusting for previously known lifestyle and genetic risk factors,” said Aina Vaivade, the study’s first author. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also dug into genetics, looking at how inherited traits might interact with chemical exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In earlier studies, people carrying a certain gene variant were thought to have a lower risk of developing MS. However, the new research found that those same people had higher odds of MS if they were also exposed to elevated levels of PFOS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that there is a complex interaction between inheritance and environmental exposure linked to the odds of MS,” Kultima said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We therefore think it is important to understand how environmental contaminants interact with hereditary factors, as this can provide new knowledge about the genesis of MS and could also be relevant for other diseases,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects the brain and spinal chord, disrupting communication with the rest of the body.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Valerii Apetroaiei – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study focused on people with MS, it adds to mounting evidence that these chemicals pose serious long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They seep into the soil, water and air — and studies show nearly all Americans have &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/understanding-ms/what-is-ms/who-gets-ms/how-many-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measurable levels in their blood&lt;/a&gt;, including newborns.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Even more troubling, the toxins don’t break down easily, allowing them to linger in the environment, and inside the human body, for an unknown amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why PCBs, despite being &lt;a href="https://ecology.wa.gov/blog/january-2024/polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs-were-banned-45-years-ago-why-are-they-still-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;banned in the US since 1979&lt;/a&gt;, are still found in the environment and older products. PFAS, meanwhile, remain widely used today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure, such as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/health/new-tool-can-remove-99-of-a-forever-chemical-from-water/"&gt;filtering drinking water&lt;/a&gt; and steering clear of nonstick cookware and grease-resistant food packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking for “PFAS-free” labels and choosing fresh, unpackaged foods can further help cut down contact with these chemicals both at home and in your everyday diet.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s not unusual for a 20-something to text Mom in a panic from the doctor’s office, seeking help answering a question. And patients of any age can struggle to recall all their medicines — or forget to mention a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the most out of a doctor’s visit requires some advance preparation. Even the professionals plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really hard — even for me as a doctor going to see my own family doctor — to remember the things that I wanted to bring up,” said Dr. Sarah Nosal, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “The worst is when you’ve had that moment with your doctor” only to recall another problem after walking out, she said. “You’ve lost that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her top tip: Bring a list of symptoms and questions to show at the start of the visit. The first item should be your top concern, but seeing the full list helps your doctor prioritize what’s most medically urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m actually going to be able to see, is there a red flag?” explained Nosal, who has some advice about prepping for a typical primary care visit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Your primary care doctor monitors your overall health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some illnesses require specialists like a cardiologist or rheumatologist. But regardless of your age or how healthy you are, research has long shown that a relationship with a primary care provider is important for overall health. It might be a family physician like Nosal, who cares for all ages, or an internist. Some patients choose gynecologists, geriatricians, or have a primary care team that includes nurse practitioners or physician assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary care is more than preventive checkups to help avoid illness, such as vaccinations, cancer screenings or health advice. It also includes detecting and treating common problems like high blood pressure, and helping to find and coordinate specialty care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That ongoing relationship also helps me know your ‘normal,’” Nosal explained. “If something’s different or changes or you feel off, when you tell me that information and I also have known you over time, we can really figure out together what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Quiz your family before the appointment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults navigating health care on their own for the first time may need help filling out forms with their personal medical history. Have you ever had general anesthesia? Is your tetanus shot up to date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still have access to the patient portal at your former pediatrician’s office, you can see records of vaccinations and prior illnesses, or you may have to request them or quiz parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all ages, family medical history is critical — and needs regular updating. Ask what diseases your close relatives have had and how they fared. For example, if Type 2 diabetes runs in the family, or Grandma had a stroke, or someone had cancer at a young age, that information could help tailor your preventive care, Nosal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fill out your paperwork ahead of the visit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out paperwork from home makes it easier to check medicine bottles for the name and dose. Include both prescription and over-the-counter medicines, pills or creams — and don’t forget vitamins and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are the latter important? Some can interact with prescription medicines. Nosal cited some patients whose longtime treatments quit working after they started taking turmeric, a spice also sold as a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also before your visit, check if the doctor received records of recent lab tests, hospitalizations or visits to other health providers, since electronic medical records aren’t always automatically shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Keep a running list of questions before a doctor visit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms are bad enough to prompt an urgent visit. But if you’ve got a checkup coming, whether it’s routine or to follow up on health problems, start a list of questions in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice a pain when you move a certain way? Or chatting with a friend who just got a colonoscopy and wonder if you’re due? Pop those on your list right away, before you forget — and be specific in describing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosal keeps a running list on her phone and, ahead of visits with her own doctor, sends it as a heads-up through her patient portal. Patients also can include their list on visit check-in forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to address the most urgent questions first, rather than patients running out of time before raising a key concern. Nosal said questions about mental or sexual health and wellness especially tend to come up at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the medium, “please bring that list,” she said. “That’s the most critical of all pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;It’s OK to ask again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may know to ask questions about treatments, such as how well they work and what side effects to expect. But it’s also important to understand why a doctor makes a particular diagnosis or, conversely, isn’t as worried about a symptom as you might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to say, “Explain to me what else could be going on,” Nosal advised. “What would be the next step? How would you evaluate that for me, to know if it’s this or that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most health advocacy groups also advise bringing along a friend or relative, especially if you have serious or multiple health problems. They can help ask questions and take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are 20 or you are 85, you will not remember everything from your medical visit,” Nosal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Both of those things are innate in simply having a body ... by virtue of being alive, you are allowed [both],” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we moralize food, we trigger all sorts of dangerous thoughts and behavior patterns in people,” she continued. &lt;/span&gt;This includes eating disorders, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="major long-term health complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;major long-term health complications&lt;/a&gt; like heart damage, hair growth issues, brain damage, lethargy and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Instead of creating these negative connections, trainers in her gym don’t mention food. If the holidays do come up, they try to focus on positive aspects like, “go have fun and enjoy the bounty, go feel the joy ... that’s the primary purpose of your body ― to experience joy,” Royse said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Royse added that people already have these damaging thoughts on their own around the holidays, as a result of years of toxic messaging in media where people are pushed to be thinner. She encourages her clients to challenge these connections they and others have made, and move instead toward body and food neutrality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Food doesn’t need to be an emotional or moral experience. You are allowed to just have it,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keefe also noted that shaming yourself for what you ate can have an additional physical consequences. As a result of the stress hormones you release through that thought pattern, you can experience &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="stomach pains and digestive problems" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;stomach pains and digestive problems&lt;/a&gt; (along with so many other issues like headaches, heart palpitations and more).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; “You’re really making yourself suffer twice,” she said.

This process, also known as mindful eating, is where you pay close attention to your food ― mentally noticing how it tastes and how enjoyable it feels to eat it. It also has you listen to your natural hunger and fullness cues. Food is not something you’ve “earned” and there is absolutely no expectation that you need to “work it off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Royse said she specifically tries to drink more water (one glass per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/holiday-drink-recipes_n_5a2818d8e4b02d3bfc3774ae" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="holiday cocktail" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5a2818d8e4b02d3bfc3774ae" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;holiday cocktail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and take more walks, not as a penalty but as a way to counteract any physical discomfort she might be feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keefe enjoys whatever holiday foods she wants, while also prioritizing nutrition. She chooses fruits and vegetables when she can, noting that the holidays don’t necessarily mean you have to only eat rich foods or only stick to the veggie tray. She has also seen clients make themselves sick trying to preemptively offset the holidays’ physical impact.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They exhaust themselves with exercise in anticipation or in reaction to how they’ve eaten during the holidays. Their overall health declines ... their bodies are under enormous stress,” she said. “Treat your body kindly.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re struggling with an eating disorder, call the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/find-help-support" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Eating Disorder Association hotline" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/find-help-support" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Eating Disorder Association hotline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; at 1-800-931-2237.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOeEhWeHNsUVZRY1FnX3BaRm9oZ0M0emJlQmFtbThNVnB0UGpMNUpyMWZrUjk0NmlPNGpoMW1GVzR4YTN2MWJVaktLT1pQcnliVkFXV3JwZy1zVFo4TTlBZF9USzlfdmpmcnk5MnRHT1Y5NVB2ZVNMMTZIOXB0VVNfcFhiSFk4NkJTY0l3MdIBkgFBVV95cUxPTmN5QTh4RHJjTHk2cWRFcmlRVE42ZXUwUlA2RnN1eWtzM3NuSVBBMUVXcTc5b1MwczRRWjVHTGJkS2c0M1pCT19zcjUwRmowYXBQVHBzX25jcXhVVzIzUVpQQVRMbWhJOWdxYUZSRG1RakQ2SFczTWhLSW9qcHVsRE4wdUpLMG1UQUFPQU1taFZyUQ</guid></item><item><title>“即将离职”的9岁儿童将“一夜之间”变成了父母不认识的愤怒的人。然后得到令人震惊的诊断（独家） - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/outgoing-9-old-changes-overnight-103000223.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Loos&lt;/p&gt; Crystal Loos' daughter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Crystal Loos noticed that her daughter was acting differently — the once bubbly child became reserved and angry, pulling back from friends, school and the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was utter terror, like she wasn't herself," the mother tells PEOPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After searching for answers, Loos' daughter finally got a diagnosis that changed everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2023, Crystal Loos began noticing that her daughter wasn’t acting like her normal self. Her once bubbly elementary schooler seemed distracted and pulled away from school, her friends and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois mother of three tells PEOPLE that her daughter, Lacy Mae, stopped eating foods that she used to enjoy, and, at the time, Loos thought it was depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this, she was the happiest, funniest, most outgoing child ever. She never had any issues," Loos, 30, shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in July 2024, there was a "complete overnight change," and the then-9-year-old was no longer “herself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lacy Mae was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, Loos knew deep down it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They tried to put her on SSRIs, they tried to get her into a psychiatrist, psychologist, everything," she says. "But I just felt that there was something deeper going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Loos&lt;/p&gt; Crystal Loos' daughter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The night in July came, and it was like she had a psychotic break that night, and she was banging on my door. She was begging to go to the hospital," Loos continues. "She knew something was wrong, but she didn't know what, because she couldn't even explain to me what was going on. It was just like she didn't have control over her brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos describes a period of time where her young daughter wouldn't sleep, felt paranoid and constantly begged to be taken to the hospital to figure out what was wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was utter terror, like she wasn't herself. She had dilated pupils. You looked at her, and she just wasn't the same kid, like, it was like something took over her," Loos says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they "had gone to multiple hospitals," nearly everyone agreed that it was just depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, Loos’ daughter begged to be admitted to a psych ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's 10 years old, so that's crazy, obviously, but she just wanted her health to get fixed," Loos says. "She begged, begged, begged to be admitted. She was, at this point, suicidal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had to sometimes hold her down because she was trying to hurt herself or us. Sometimes we would have to lock her and us in a room together so that she wouldn't. She was more of a danger to herself than us," she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos, who was recently postpartum when Lacy Mae's health took a turn, says her parents then stepped in to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Loos&lt;/p&gt; Crystal Loos' daughter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, she did have to move in with my parents because I had a newborn baby, and then I also have a 5-year-old, and my 5-year-old was just terrified of her," she says. "He was just absolutely terrified because she was screaming. Rage is what I could describe her. She had so much rage in her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos’ daughter refused to eat, refused to go to school, and ended up missing most of fourth grade. While many people believed the new baby could have caused Lacy Mae's personality change, Loos noted that it was much deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm like, ‘You guys don't get it. She was running away from home. She was trying to jump out of moving cars, like just complete psychosis.’ It was nothing like I've ever seen before. Especially as a child and in my childhood, I never had any issues before this," she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Lacy Mae was admitted to a behavioral health unit. During that time, Loos turned to various Facebook mom groups for support, asking if anyone else had ever experienced something similar. A few people mentioned that it could be PANS/PANDAS, so Loos got to work researching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went to the psychiatrist at the children's hospital, and I literally begged. I was bawling at him. I said, 'She has something wrong with her. I think this is what it is: PANS /PANDAS. Can we do any further workup?' They refused to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/pans.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stanford University School of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) is a clinical diagnosis for children who "have a dramatic – sometimes overnight – onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms" characterized by the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCD) or eating restrictions. They may also have symptoms of depression, behavioral regression, irritability, anxiety, sleep issues, and difficulty with schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) is a subset of PANS, and has five distinct criteria for diagnosis, including "abrupt 'overnight' OCD or dramatic, disabling tics; a relapsing-remitting, episodic symptom course; young age at onset (average of 6–7 years); presence of neurologic abnormalities;" and a recent streptococcal infection, such as strep throat, peri-anal strep or scarlet fever, per the &lt;a href="https://www.pandasppn.org/what-are-pans-pandas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PANDAS Physicains Network.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PANDAS Physicains Network. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t an official test to diagnose PANS/PANDAS, making it hard for medical professionals to determine it as the root cause of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Loos took her daughter out of the psych ward and searched for a doctor who specialized in PANS/PANDAS. They eventually contacted Indiana-based specialist Dr. Antoine, and in September 2024, after in-depth blood work, Lacy Mae was officially diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was put on antibiotics and received IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) to help her immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Loos&lt;/p&gt; Crystal Loos and her daughter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She had different infections in her body that were mistakenly attacking her brain. She had several different infections," Loos shares. "She had a tick-borne illness. She had mycoplasma, plasma pneumonia, and these are all things that Dr. Antoine checked for. That's how we figured out what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He put her on antibiotics to kill these infections, and then he put her on antibiotics to regulate her immune system, and then the IVIG, that's also to regulate the immune system, and then different supplements just to get her immune system back to normal so that it attacks the infection rather than attacking her brain,” Loos adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, treatment began to work, and by December of 2024, Loos says they started to “see her again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Loos admits the tween "still had a lot of episodes after that,” the severity of those episodes decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was having just so much anxiety through all this because I was like, I don't know what to do," she shares. "I can't even describe how bad it was. It was literally like a living hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy Mae was also put on an anti-psychotic to help calm her down, and now, just over one year after her diagnosis, Loos says the 10-year-old is "99%" herself again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She does have some setbacks and a little bit of anxiety here and there, but for the most part, ever since we found Dr. Antoine and got on the right medication, she has been thriving, and life is pretty much back to normal for the most part," Loos says. "She goes to school. She plays sports. She plays with her friends, which she hasn't done for a while. Now she's completely back to living life and enjoying life again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos recently shared a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crysrenae/video/7580132165707451662" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; showing the difference in her daughter to raise awareness of PANS/PANDAS. The video went viral, amassing over 45 million views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that parents have since reached out to share their own stories about how their children changed seemingly without cause. She’s been able to connect them with resources and talk them through what they’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want parents to get answers. I want them to know that this is a thing and something to look into if your child has similar symptoms. I wish I would have found it sooner, before our life got really hard with it," she tells PEOPLE. "It's really amazing, because I've gotten so many messages and people, saying the kindest things and that they've been through it, and they know how it feels, and they're so grateful that I'm spreading awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we were going through this, I was really struggling because I didn't feel like I could find other parents that were dealing with this," she continues. "It’s very, very lonely, and you want to find any information you can, and there's just not a lot out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos wants to educate people on PANS/PANDAS since it's a diagnosis that "is not widely known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I think it's honestly not a rare diagnosis.

        &lt;p&gt;Want to visualize radioactive particles? You don’t need a boatload of lab equipment. Just a cloud chamber. And [Curious Scientist] is showing off an &lt;a href="https://curiousscientist.tech/blog/diy-cloud-chamber-with-hv-grid" target="_blank"&gt;improved miniature cloud chamber&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to replicate using a 3D printer and common components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build uses a Peltier module, a CPU cooler, an aluminum plate, thermal paste, and headlight film. The high voltage comes from a sacrificed mosquito swatter. The power input for the whole system is any 12V supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud chamber was high tech back in 1911 when physicist Charles T. R. Wilson made ionizing radiation visible by creating trails of tiny liquid droplets in a supersaturated vapor of alcohol or water. Charged particles pass through, leaving visible condensation trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-885801"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the post, the cost of everything is under $100. He hasn’t made the 3D printed parts freely available, but there are enough pictures that you can probably work it out yourself. Besides, you’d almost certainly have to rework it for your particular jar, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a cloud chamber’s construction isn’t a state secret. We’ve seen some fancy &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/09/desk-top-peltier-powered-cloud-chamber-uses-desktop-parts/"&gt;Peltier-based designs&lt;/a&gt;. If you manage your expectations, you can build one for even less using a &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/02/11/maybe-the-simplest-cloud-chamber/"&gt;plastic bottle and ingenuity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	            &lt;/div&gt;

He loves his humans and life in general, and as far as Golden Retrievers go, he’s as loyal as they come. Anyone who meets Boone can tell instantly that he takes his role as a family member very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine his surprise when his family betrayed that loyalty by having a backyard photo shoot without him. There they were, dressed nicely and standing arm in arm in front of the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-loses-ball-bushes-120000740.html" data-ylk="slk:bushes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;bushes&lt;/a&gt;—and where was 5-year-old Boone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the house, dramatically making a scene in the window for all to see! Boone made sure his humans could not miss how he was feeling about the obvious oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluffy Golden Retriever spotted his humans out in the yard and clearly felt like he belonged out there, too. He propped himself up at the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/goldendoodle-conducts-neighborhood-trash-truck-watch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:window;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;window &lt;/a&gt;and performed his best air bicycle routine against the glass, desperately trying to get their attention.

You forgot me!” or “How dare you leave me out of the photo—I make everything better!” And he’s not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let's Check in With the Comment Section&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TikTok video, recently shared by @golden_boy_boone, quickly captured viewers’ attention. Many of the Golden Retriever’s fans were flabbergasted that he’d intentionally been left out of the portrait. @blah asked, “Now, why would you leave him out?” while @feegs23 summed it up perfectly with a simple, “How rude!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of Boone’s fellow four-legged TikTok stars also took his side. @RebaandDolly declared, “Rude! Your family photo is missing the main character!” while @Mygoldennuggettito exclaimed, “What!!! Get him out there now!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not being in the actual photo, Boone let everyone know that he was the star of the show, nonetheless!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/golden-retriever-left-out-of-family-photo-everyone-upset" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PawNation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PawNation&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 20, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; section.

There are questions about what happens over Christmas when everyone meets up and it's easier for the virus to infect older people who are more at risk. There are also signs a different strain of flu - H1N1 - is picking up in Europe and may lead to an increase in cases here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But a "broadly typical flu season" is probably not the sense you'd get from watching or reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Statistical artistry was used to compare an early flu season to one that started much later allowing claims of flu cases being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-ready-double-whammy-winter-fludemic-strikes/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"an incredible 10 times higher"&lt;/a&gt; than in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was technically true, but is like saying your train to Glasgow got you there in record time… but the journey time was identical, you just booked an earlier train. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;NHS England was not the first organisation to start calling it superflu, but Prof Meghana Pandit, national medical director at NHS England, did label it an "&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8r30787e76o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;unprecedented wave of super flu&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It has been suggested by the British Medical Association that flu has been used to scaremonger while resident doctors were deciding whether to continue their strike action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Superflu isn't a scientific description and the BBC Health Team has not found any expert who thinks it is an accurate one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I don't think it's a helpful term, there isn't a particularly unusual set of symptoms, there's no indication of it being associated with exceptional severity, exceptionally rapid spread or exceptional health impact," says Prof Fraser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One of the UK's top flu scientists, Prof Nicola Lewis, the director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, said the virus was "not particularly unusual" and that she saw "no evidence" the virus was "particularly different" and superflu "wouldn't be my description".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The former deputy chief medical officer for England through the pandemic, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7405275742994919424/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7405516492009676800%29&amp;amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7406388088220065792%29&amp;amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287405516492009676800%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29&amp;amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287406388088220065792%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm very unclear what is meant by the rather silly term of 'superflu'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Crying wolf?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Persuading people to get the flu vaccine saves lives and last winter the jabs were estimated to have kept around 100,000 people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-prevented-around-100000-hospital-admissions" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;out of hospital&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, experts have started to question whether the escalation in language used since the Covid pandemic could harm trust in official health advice.

(Emily Mesner / ADN)  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Over a roughly three-year period beginning in March 2020, 1,564 Alaskans died from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;That’s according to a new report from the Alaska Department of Health, which provides a detailed review of data on how the state fared dealing with the coronavirus between March 2020 and the end of the the federal public health emergency in May 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“This report ... represents the first comprehensive, retrospective analysis that brings together epidemiological data across the full course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alaska,” Department of Health spokesperson Shirley Sakaye wrote in an emailed response to questions. “While the pandemic’s impacts extended far beyond what can be captured in an epidemiological summary, this report provides a consolidated, data-driven account of Alaska’s COVID-19 experience.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Epidemiologists looked at death records, hospitalizations, demographics, infections, vaccination rates and public health responses, producing an analysis that evaluates the different phases that played out as Alaska weathered the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The 1,564 COVID deaths equates to 1 in every 500 Alaska residents during the period of review, they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“Seventy-four percent of those who died and were eligible for COVID-19 vaccine had opted not to receive it‚" states the &lt;a href="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/rr2025_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/rr2025_01.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, published earlier in December by the state’s Section of Epidemiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The report provides a chronological review of how the virus impacted Alaska, broken down into seven distinct phases determined by developments in the public health response and viral mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“Over time, it became clear that simply aggregating numbers across multiple years did not adequately reflect the reality of the pandemic, because the context was continually changing,” Sakaye wrote of the impetus for the analysis. “To better capture that complexity, the report organizes Alaska’s experience into distinct pandemic ‘eras.’ This approach more accurately reflects how conditions, risks and public health responses shifted over time. One of the key takeaways is that a pandemic is not a single event, but an extended and evolving experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=550" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=188 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=275 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=528 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=704 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/5JXCHUDALFCUHG7YEEKUQRGDQA.JPG?auth=c7b441b4e7af06abc7c6aa84512ad058eba54ec36bb85d1cdecf593ef0e2de49&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=990 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;A sign taped to the front door of The Kobuk on W.

(Emily Mesner / ADN) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Alaska’s former chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, who helmed the state’s response to the coronavirus, said the report is valuable for public health officials and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“I think it’s really for the future,” said Zink, who no longer works for the state. During the pandemic, she said, she regularly consulted old epidemiological reports on Alaska’s response to previous epidemics like influenza, which informed public health measures to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Zink did not author the new coronavirus report but did review it and provide feedback. She said she&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found the delineation between phases to be particularly useful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The first era, for example, was the “pandemic onset,” from March until May 2020, a time when the state saw a low number of cases and people were still largely obeying government public health orders such as business closures, physical distancing and limited travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“Alaska’s geographic location and the implementation of (non-pharmaceutical interventions) prior to the first detected case prevented widespread community transmission. This resulted in a smaller initial COVID-19 wave and lower rates of morbidity and mortality compared to many areas in the contiguous U.S. for the same period,” wrote report author Katherine Newell with the Alaska Section of Epidemiology, who no longer works for the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Alaska started seeing more infections in the summer of 2020, as prevention measures started to be relaxed in some jurisdictions. The state and its health care partners were aggressive about virus testing for critical infrastructure employees, travelers and the public. By August of that year, Alaska was “the most tested state (per capita) in the nation,” according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=552" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=189 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=276 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=529 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=706 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/QQKJFM5KP5FT5NPQYKLOAYLVI4.JPG?auth=908993083eb641378f9ecdec67f2547790e68019e4608ac0660b731b980018ef&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=993 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Avii Mafuao receives a COVID-19 test at a drive-through testing site at 4810 C Street in Anchorage on Jan. 8, 2022.

Even though Asians and Pacific Islanders are assessed as part of the same group, the Pacific Islander community in Alaska fared far worse, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The report does not explain the reasons for the disparities. Zink said many of the patterns that played out from the coronavirus mirror trends from other diseases that have spread through Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“Alaska Natives have worse health outcomes,” Zink said, offering several socioeconomic factors that likely play a role, including household overcrowding, lack of water and sewer infrastructure in many communities, and inconsistent access to emergency medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;But, she added, much about the coronavirus’s transmissibility and pathology is still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“I don’t want to pretend we know what we don’t know,” Zink said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="adn-article-body__h3"&gt;Delta devastation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Once vaccines arrived, Alaska vaccinated early and rapidly.

Those who died were overwhelmingly older: The median age of death during the delta era was 75. They were also overwhelmingly unvaccinated: 80% of those who died, 575 people, “were unvaccinated against COVID-19 at the time of their death,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;In that same six-month period, 2,021 Alaskans were hospitalized because of COVID-19, putting “unprecedented strain on staff and bed capacity” at hospitals around the state, and prompting officials to coordinate bringing more than 400 health care workers up from outside to assist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;When the omicron variant replaced delta as the dominant strain, it proved far more transmissible, but less potent.

The author steers away from attributing COVID-19 deaths that might have technically been caused by factors like heart disease, underlying conditions or drug overdoses, but were exacerbated by pandemic conditions like social isolation or restricted health care access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“These excess deaths reflect the broader consequences of the pandemic on the public’s health. Further research is necessary to fully understand the factors driving excess mortality and the broader public health impact of the pandemic in Alaska,” the report states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Fully vaccinated Alaskans still got sick with COVID-19 and some, particularly those who were older or in poor health, still succumbed to the disease. But one of the repeated conclusions in the analysis is that the state’s early vaccine uptake helped protect residents during the later waves of highly transmissible variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“Based on the significant difference in age-adjusted mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, high vaccine uptake during this era likely saved numerous lives in Alaska,” the report notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Correction:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; This story and headline have been updated to clarify that 1 in 500 Alaskans died from COVID-19 during pandemic, not that 1 in 500 Alaskan deaths during pandemic was from COVID-19.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:article-html-block-XZPCKSSMAFCDHH26Q55VTZQV4I" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-XZPCKSSMAFCDHH26Q55VTZQV4I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="adn-article-body__html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:article-html-block-XZPCKSSMAFCDHH26Q55VTZQV4I" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-XZPCKSSMAFCDHH26Q55VTZQV4I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 23:15:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPSjFaSm45Zzl1X25HRE1xZC10T1RNQW42MUpYWWx2SzBJQW8tZVFGWkRLejlYYjhzTUQ1MUg3NUw3cEVkS2RoczJYOGwtamVLei1FdWdVX29HX25ZWHN1NV9OZGNMTnBya0c3OW1XTjNfMFRScVg2Mk9nMlNUQ1FkbkNIbGhMSi1JN2VBMFdDWDhudlV1ZXhXdkJINHZvZHhmS2VsaS1UdUdVNm9yeVNtNC10R3UyUQ</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，随着年龄的增长，这种早晨的习惯可以支持您的骨骼健康- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-bone-health-study-11873585</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests morning tea drinkers may have stronger bones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea is linked to improved bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study excluded decaffeinated or herbal tea, but included all other varieties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis seems to be one of those often overlooked conditions that takes a back seat to more urgent ones, like heart disease and cancer. But in the bigger health picture, osteoporosis can also impact quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis is a disease that develops when your bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass decrease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s often referred to as a "silent" disease because it typically has no symptoms—until you break a bone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The risk of osteoporosis increases with age, especially after menopause. Based on the latest data, about 13% of U.S. adults over 50 were diagnosed with osteoporosis; this number jumps to almost 18% for those 65 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If we consider just women, 13% of those in the 50 to 64 age bracket had osteoporosis, and 27% of those aged 65 and over had the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors influence one’s risk for osteoporosis, many of them lifestyle-related. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercises-women-over-50-for-strong-bones-11833636" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight-bearing exercise&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and walking, may help prevent osteoporosis. Smoking and heavy alcohol use increase your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;what you eat also plays a role in bone health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that foods, like dairy, are rich in bone-supporting nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin D, some beverages have not yet locked in their bone-health status. Take coffee and tea, for example. Studies have been inconsistent in their results regarding coffee and tea consumption and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-every-week-for-stronger-bones-11853649" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; in postmenopausal women. That’s why researchers in Australia took a closer look at this topic, trying to clear up some of the confusion. They published their findings in &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew about 10 years of data from a 20-year study called the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), which included more than 9,700 women aged 65 and older. At clinical visits during years two, four, five and six of the study, the participants had their femoral neck and total hip bone mineral densities measured, which are common BMD measurement sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same clinical visits, participants also completed self-administered questionnaires regarding coffee and tea consumption. Specifically, for coffee, they were asked, "Do you currently drink regular coffee? If yes, on average, how many cups of regular coffee do you usually consume per day?" For tea consumption, participants were asked "Do you currently drink tea or iced tea (excluding herbal or decaffeinated varieties)? If yes, on average, how many cups of tea do you usually consume per day?"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics, which would be adjusted for during statistical analyses, were also collected, including age, BMI, cigarette smoking status, age at menopause, lifetime alcohol intake, lifetime physical activity and oral estrogen and steroid use. Medical histories were also taken, and weekly calcium and protein intake were calculated based on a 20-item dietary scale that participants completed at baseline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found no positive benefits of drinking coffee on bone mineral density. However, they did find potential negative effects on bone mineral density for those who drank more than five cups of coffee a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea drinkers, however, may have an advantage over coffee drinkers, as researchers found an association between tea consumption and higher total hip bone mineral density in older postmenopausal women.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note a few limitations to their study, starting with participants' self-reporting of coffee and tea consumption. Related to this, participants were not asked more detailed questions, like the size of their beverage cups and beverage strength. In addition, due to the length of follow-up (10 years) and the ages of the women, some died before the study’s end, and others were unable to finish due to health reasons. The dwindling participant pool may have weakened the study results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee and tea are some of the most widely consumed beverages globally. Because they’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt;, they contain antioxidants and the potential to lower inflammation and disease risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coffee has been linked with&lt;/a&gt; a healthier heart and brain, among other benefits. It might also boost your mood and give you more energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a regular tea sipper, you might even live longer and have a stronger immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The great thing about tea is that there’s a flavor for everyone. From green, black and white to jasmine, rooibos and mint, teas span the flavor spectrum—and they're all loaded with powerful plant compounds. If you want to go beyond traditional hot or iced tea, brew up some of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8050463/how-to-make-thai-iced-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Thai Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266309/warm-honey-green-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Warm Honey Green Tea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/berry-green-tea-smoothie-8746131" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Berry Green Tea Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bone health, other foods also have an influence. For example, you’re aware that dairy is good for your bones, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-protein-for-bone-health-11719674" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;canned salmon&lt;/a&gt; is also a great bone builder. There’s also evidence that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bone-health-mediterranean-diet-11711574" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, especially when combined with exercise, may help prevent osteoporosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-created-by-a-dietitian-11739365" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Check out our 30-Day Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;.

They look kind of dazed. They’re miserable. There’s a glassy look to their eyes,” he said.

While anyone of any age can be affected, H3N2 tends to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6c3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;There is concern that kids who are sick now with flu will spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“With schools going on break for a couple of weeks and family gatherings happening, it’s quite possible that some of the existing mixing of viruses amongst the school groups are going to change to a different population,” Budd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fdf" class="body-heading"&gt;Where is flu spreading? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-96f626"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1238" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg" alt="U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512050" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu activity is high or very high in 14 states — including Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey and South Carolina — as well as New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecda59" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu doesn’t need to be widespread, however, to be deadly. While the CDC’s latest report shows “minimal” flu activity in Wisconsin, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/121825.htm" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that a child in the state died of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3493" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/17/ncdhhs-announces-first-pediatric-flu-death-2025-26-season-urges-vaccination-children-6-months-and" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bac42a" class="body-graf"&gt;Those cases are likely not counted among the CDC’s latest report, which shows three pediatric flu deaths so far this year, as the data is current through Dec. 13. The CDC’s next flu update will release on Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c71f8" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2024-2025 flu season was particularly deadly, especially for children. According to the latest data, 288 children died of flu — tying a record set during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0029" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report published in September&lt;/a&gt; found that half of the children who died of flu last year were otherwise healthy. About 89% hadn’t received the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d434f" class="body-heading"&gt;Will the flu shot work this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1aecc" class="body-graf"&gt;The annual flu shot is notoriously imperfect when it comes to matching the exact strains of flu that circulate. This year, a strain called H3N2 subclade K emerged, making changes on the surface protein of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896c6d" class="body-graf"&gt;The surface protein is important because that’s what the body looks for to recognize whether it’s seen the virus before. If the protein looks even slightly different, the body may not be able to fight it off as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-571039" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s hard to predict how well this vaccine will ultimately work. Even though the strain has “drifted” a bit, the vaccines do contain protection against H3N2 virus in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9904a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve had past seasons where there have been what we call drifted viruses, which is how we would categorize this subclade K,” she said. “In some of those instances, there have been impacts on vaccine effectiveness, but there have also been seasons with drifted strains where we’ve seen the vaccine continue to provide protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9de3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s important for everyone, including children, to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7605af" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is still the primary preventive measure against flu, severe illness, and we absolutely continue to recommend it this year, even in light of the drifted strain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-527bf3" class="body-graf"&gt;Demand for Tamiflu, an antiviral used to help treat the flu, is slightly higher than it was this time last year, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research/flu-season-tracking-tamiflu-fills" target="_blank"&gt;according to GoodRx.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31e609" class="body-graf"&gt;People generally only get prescription antivirals when they’re sick enough to go to the doctor, not just because they tested positive for the flu, said Tori Marsh, senior director of research for GoodRx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e97017" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“What stands out this season is how early Tamiflu use is climbing,” she said. “When we see prescription antiviral use rise sooner than average, it often points to flu activity building earlier and potentially lasting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxORnhRcmJjVjJpVVlaM0N1S1hYeUxCazA0OFlfNnhQUVUzeXZlMTZmYjFPMl9wc0ZhMjRkdFNmbWFCWl9KVW9JbENONUlnRE5GYXhhRTMyZ05Ib28wSjlndG9xZ2VxUElWSVItMjV2Z3VHYlNIdjU2UHhvOUZjZHp1WWNWbEE3em1aVHlqSlVoSC1vRFhmVXhGR0tDTkdObXJORGZGQnhadU5lRm5O0gFWQVVfeXFMT3FFR0pETzRtRWdmV3N4cjVOLTJpU2UtTGNJNmVxWEhaWFh1U29BbnpwME1FQWVQS3dIckFiUXJfWlZoTi1od2h3UkphbVpxMzVEekIxQ0E</guid></item><item><title>随着流感开始蔓延，湾区学区近三分之一的孩子生病--《旧金山纪事报》</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/marin-flu-outbreak-schools-21252876.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration has awarded a $1.6 million, no-bid contract to a Danish university to study hepatitis B vaccinations on newborns in Africa that is raising ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual contract was awarded to scientists who have been cited by anti-vaccine activists and whose work has been questioned by leading public health experts. Some experts have suggested the research plan is unethical, because it will withhold vaccines that work from newborns at significant risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract did not undergo a customary ethics review, The Associated Press has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded the grant to a research team at the University of Southern Denmark that has been lauded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-12-18/pdf/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal notice posted this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s leaders is Christine Stabell Benn, a consultant for a Kennedy-appointed committee that recently voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;stop recommending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a dose of hepatitis B vaccine for all U.S. newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The study is to begin early next year in Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished West African nation where hepatitis B infection &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746078/#:~:text=Results:%20A%20total%20of%202715,enqu%C3%AAtes%20dans%20la%20population%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The researchers are funded for five years to study 14,000 newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s to be a randomized controlled trial, with some infants given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and some not. Children will be tracked for death, illness and long-term developmental outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children will be followed for less than two years to look for side effects, but the first 500 enrolled will be followed for five years to look for behavior and brain development problems. There is no placebo involved, according to a copy of the study protocol prepared earlier this year that was obtained by the AP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be passed from an infected mother to a baby. It also can be spread by other infected people a baby comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Research and widespread medical consensus holds that the hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns, so withholding it from some babies — in this case, Black babies — has raised ethical alarms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evidence is clear that the vaccine protects infants from developing liver disease and an early death. The well-documented infection risk far outweighs hypothetical concerns about side effects, said Dr. Boghuma K. Titanji, an Emory University infectious diseases doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called the study “unconscionable,” and said it likely will exacerbate existing vaccine hesitancy in Africa and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much potential for this to be a harmful study,” said Titanji, who is from Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benn did not respond to an email seeking comment about the proposal. An automatic response said she is out of the office until early January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the research team said the study “will be the first and likely the only one of its kind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said it takes advantage of an unusual window of opportunity: Guinea-Bissau doesn’t currently recommended a birth dose of the hep B vaccine, but the nation will be implementing universal vaccination of newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine skeptics and opponents have suggested that all the vaccine’s possible side effects were inadequately studied before the CDC began recommending it for newborns in 1991. Public health experts counter that over more than three decades no serious side effect has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award is highly unusual. The CDC did not announce a research funding opportunity and invite proposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was unsolicited and the award did not go through customary review, said a CDC official with knowledge of the decision. Department of Health and Human Services officials told CDC officials to approve it and said HHS would provide special funding for it, the CDC official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private communications channels, CDC staffers were expressing outrage about the award, said the official, who is not authorized to talk about it and spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those CDC scientists have compared the work to the infamous &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/30ba57133d6b47618eff042285b54d0e"&gt;Tuskegee Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which the agency oversaw in its later stages. In that decades-long study, health workers withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could track the horrible ravages of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Like Tuskegee, this study involves the prospect of researchers watching people grow ill when a medical intervention could have kept them healthy, Titanji echoed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is an apt comparison,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study’s researchers say the trial was approved by a national ethics committee in Guinea-Bissau. But it did not undergo a customary ethics review within the CDC, the agency official told the AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists noted questions have been raised in the past about research led by Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, in their &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this year, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling a 2017 study co-authored by Aaby and Benn “fundamentally flawed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several researchers had harsh words about the latest award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aaby and Benn are doing the Guinea-Bissau HBV vaccine depravation trial,” Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist, wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mac5tfh4722v" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Bluesky. “Did RFK Jr. just call up the first name in the antivax yellow pages?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/angierasmussen.bsky.social/post/3mablyin5is2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was giving taxpayers’ money to his “cronies” for a “grossly unethical study that will expose African babies to hep B for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Researchers found that GABAergic neurons in the BNST activate glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe, causing immediate arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DpMe neurons were removed, the arousal response weakened dramatically, proving they are essential for this stress-to-wake circuitry. These findings reveal how fear and anxiety can instantly disrupt sleep and point to new therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; BNST GABAergic neurons trigger fast arousal via DpMe glutamatergic neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing DpMe glutamatergic cells sharply reduced stress-induced wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this circuit may help treat stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional states and stress strongly influence sleep-wake regulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala and its related structures have long been implicated in regulating arousal. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers examined how GABAergic neurons in the BNST interact with glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe to induce rapid arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of BNST GABAergic neurons during NREM sleep resulted in immediate arousal, accompanied by a robust increase in DpMe neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, selective ablation of glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe significantly reduced this response, demonstrating their essential role in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to thoroughly describe a BNST-DpMe neural pathway mediating emotional signals to arousal centers. In addition, the findings offer novel insights into how mental stressors such as fear and anxiety can disrupt sleep and highlights potential therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI), a JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (JP 18H02595) (TS), Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory) 21K19287(TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (JP 21H05036) (TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 23H04941 (TS), AMED Moonshot Research and Development Program, Grant Number JP21zf0127005 (TS), JSPS Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research 22K213511(TS) and JST, CREST Grant Number JPMJCR24T4, JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A) 23H04941(TS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178162286"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;How does emotional stress wake the brain so quickly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: By activating a BNST-to-DpMe circuit that instantly shifts NREM sleep into wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163874"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Which neurons are required for this arousal response?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe are essential for transmitting the wake-up signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Why does this matter for insomnia?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It identifies a concrete neural pathway that may be overactive in stress-related sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this stress and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c575354534f5548497c495212484f4957495e5d125d5f12564c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Similarly, an aversive air-puff activated GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, suggesting engagement by emotionally salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ablation of GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons markedly attenuated arousal responses triggered by GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; stimulation, underscoring their essential role in this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed local input neurons to GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; cells, in situ hybridization identified few &lt;em&gt;Vgat-&lt;/em&gt;positive interneurons among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons may influence GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through noncanonical GABAergic mechanisms or via more complex local circuits beyond a simple disinhibition model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings delineate a previously uncharacterized BNST–DpMe circuit that allows emotionally relevant stimuli to override sleep and promote arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway may contribute to stress-related sleep disturbances and represents a potential target for therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders associated with emotional dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:15:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9FTzZXdm94cW9FRjRnMERibndvajdHQWszQm91SmdQVGowSExsaUxJbHhXN3h2U3JiQlZrTEZzOXJhbG55ZHJNYTUwaUxlc3pnNm12YVptcm5qMmtkdmUzdmdaNHBmT0w3VGc</guid></item><item><title>R.F.K.

But experts say this variant, called subclade K, has a number of mutations that don’t respond as well to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evqqr"&gt;“Symptom-wise, [there’s] nothing that we know that's different about this virus outside of the fact that it's just going to be able to infect more people and therefore we'll see more cases,” said Andy Pekosz, a virologist and professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95n2o"&gt;Still, Pekosz encouraged people to get vaccinated to prevent the most severe symptoms of the disease, and to guard against some of the other strains in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ao9j"&gt;As of mid-November, 3.4 million New Yorkers statewide had received their flu shots — about 5% fewer than had been vaccinated by that time last year, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="6q94h"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schools, kids on the front line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8u9br"&gt;The virus is also coursing its way through city schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9jsre"&gt;In New York City, nearly 500,000 children have received flu shots so far this season, representing a 6.5% drop compared to the same period last year, according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="29a9m"&gt;Parents have been telling Gothamist anecdotally that classrooms have been half-empty this week but the city Department of Education couldn’t immediately say if there’s been a significant, systemwide drop in attendance.

	Richard Eby knew things were getting bad when the schools shut down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Eby is a family medicine doctor based in Andrews, in West Texas. It’s a quiet town of 14,000, chock full of all-American touches — a Buffalo Wild Wings sits a few doors down from La Hacienda, a bottomless Mexican buffet with neon cacti on its facade and brightly colored &lt;em&gt;papel picado&lt;/em&gt; strung across its interior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Like many other towns nestled in Texas’ Permian Basin — of &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights &lt;/em&gt;fame — it is also unapologetically high-school-football-crazy: Andrews High School’s astroturfed Mustang Bowl, capacity 8,000, sits at the northwestern border of Mustang Drive, which forms a necklace around town. (The Mustangs, who have a long legacy of district championships tracing back to 1953, went 5-7 last year — though they refused to go down without notching three blowout wins against district rivals.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Come last January, there were new whispers around town. Eby had heard from colleagues that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Gaines County, 30 miles north. And by the end of the month, he’d seen a few cases himself.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That was, in some respects, to be expected. After a 2019 outbreak in West Texas, a couple more confirmed cases in the South in 2023, and given that neighboring counties’ school districts have some of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state —13 times the national average — Eby has gotten used to keeping the potentially life-threatening virus on his radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s always at the back of your mind,” he says.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But it wasn’t until some local schools started shutting down in the ensuing weeks that Eby realized how bad this outbreak could get. Something felt off to the pediatrician — he says that, at the time, he recalls the official case count being a dozen. “That just tells you how far undercounted the cases were,” Eby says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the months that followed, more than 750 measles cases were diagnosed — 414 in Gaines County alone. Ninety-nine patients were hospitalized for severe symptoms such as inability to breathe and inflammation in the brain. Two otherwise healthy, stone-cold-normal children died.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To pediatricians like Eby, the outbreaks meant every typically innocuous symptom in clinic — every cough or sniffle, every hive or wheal or welt — put him and his staff on high alert. That’s because measles can start as just a stuffy nose and a red dot on the abdomen, but the illness rapidly evolves into whole-body bumps and blisters accompanied by difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it produces a child so sleepy they can’t be woken up, or seizures that won’t stop, because of swelling in the brain. And it can all happen within days of the itch starting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So, Eby hasn’t been taking chances. “All of a sudden, a same-day appointment that’s on the schedule as a cough and rash,” he says, “you need to ask, ‘Did anyone clarify?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine — the kind where a previously largely-forgotten foe was now lurking in the community, in the waiting room, and in doctors’ minds — also felt a bit like a step back in time, Eby says. At various points during the outbreak, he found himself thinking, “Is every kid going to have measles for the next couple weeks?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine is also becoming the norm, and not just in Texas. Even as attention has turned elsewhere — shutdowns, boat strikes, Epstein — the measles outbreak continues to rage throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As of Dec. 2, almost 2,000 cases have been confirmed across 43 states. (The Centers for Disease Control is not publicly sharing the number of so-called probable cases — ones that were not tested. During previous international outbreaks, between 10 percent and 70 percent of cases were not tested.) That number is the highest in the United States since 1992. And after a summer lull, cases are climbing again: The week before Thanksgiving, the number of cases was the highest since May.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Should the spikes continue into January, the U.S. will lose its “measles-free” designation from the World Health Organization — a label achieved in 2000. That’s part of a larger trend: In November, the WHO stripped the Americas of its measles-free label amid historic outbreaks in both Canada and Mexico. (Mexican officials say their outbreak was seeded from Texas; Canadian officials say theirs started with an “internationally imported” case, but did not specify whether it was American.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“This loss represents a setback,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the region’s WHO oversight body, said of removing the measles-free label. “We call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccination/" id="auto-tag_vaccination" data-tag="vaccination"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases. Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To some domestic public health officials, the issue isn’t just that the outbreaks are a step backward. It’s that they’re entirely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Life has enough curveballs and trauma that to have a tragedy like someone passing away from a completely preventable disease — that’s just hard to believe,” James McDonald, pediatrician and commissioner of the New York Department of Health, says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s not just measles. Cases of whooping cough increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, above pre-pandemic highs. Hospitalizations from flu this past year were at the highest rates in more than a decade. In 2024, almost 4,000 infants were born with syphilis infections — a figure eight times higher than the 2015 number. “We’re still dealing with things that First World nations shouldn’t even be talking about,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But under the current Trump administration, health officials say, it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under them — from under public health, as an institution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have been the obvious, explicitly damaging measures. Take, for instance, the administration’s all-out assault on vaccines, which most recently, in early December, led the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to nix the decades-long recommendation to immunize all newborns against hepatitis B. The same day, a presidential memo directed Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to “review best practices” related to vaccines and update the childhood immunization schedule accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have also been less obvious measures. Billions of dollars in cuts to the CDC, buried in the fine print of federal budgets. Billions more public health dollars to states clawed back, hidden in cases winding their way through the federal courts. Mass layoffs to the epidemiologists, and lab workers  and data collectors responsible for responding to, diagnosing, and tracking disease outbreaks in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Taken together, experts worry that the steps to hamstring the CDC (and other state departments) have imperiled the public’s health for political purposes. These actions are “seeding doubt …[and] hijacking resources away from families…[with] significant consequences,” says Susan Kressly, pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the meantime, the measles outbreak is “continuing to grow,” she adds, “with no end in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="code-lavender" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Code Lavender&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Somewhere in Lubbock, Texas, stashed away in the corner of a hospital closet, there’s a cart stocked to the teeth with lavender-scented products. There are rollerballs and brushes. There are sachets and steamers. There are lavender-colored journals and pens, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The cart — and the team of counselors, chaplains, peer coaches, and therapy dogs that accompany it — was borne out of necessity during the Covid pandemic, says Shannon Bates, chief nursing officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital. The goal, she says, was to use aromatherapy, reflection, dialogue, and community to combat the “secondary trauma response” associated with death after death from that virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For a while after the height of the pandemic, the cart got less mileage. But during the measles outbreak, the Covenant team has been pulling it out again. That’s partially because, in some ways, the script has flipped on clinical staff. With the unavoidable, politically charged conversations around vaccines that accompany the outbreak, “it’s kind of the opposite of Covid, where everyone was the health-care hero,” Bates says. “Now, you’re seen as the bad guy, the one who can’t be trusted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s also because, in addition to staff enduring rhetoric around health workers that’s ranged from distrust to resentment, they’ve witnessed firsthand just how harmful the measles outbreak can be. In February, a six-year-old girl died after being admitted to Covenant — the nation’s first death from the outbreak. That “definitely has taken a toll on staff,” Bates says. Since then, she adds, “we have done some proactive rounding.” In other words, rather than waiting for someone to ask for a rollerball or a sachet, they’ve taken to roaming the halls with the cart, the chaplains, and the puppies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Summer Davies also recalls the start of the outbreak, when the first call came in. It was the early afternoon, just after the team finished rounding. Davies, a pediatrician and associate professor at Texas Tech University, was patched through to a doctor who told her the child had a fever, and a rash, and needed to be admitted precautionarily. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘I don’t know, maybe it’s not measles,’” Davies says. That changed within moments of seeing just how sick the child was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Davies was there when the six-year-old died, too — an experience she calls “devastating.” The death stuck with her: Long after it happened, she and her colleagues wondered, “Could we have done something different to help that child?”

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Amid the circumstances, Davies says her hospital, as well as the county and state public health departments, was incredibly supportive. “We have had people…advocating for us, taking all of the right steps, making sure we’re safe and that patients are safe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Off the wards, though, things were harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As the outbreak raged, federal agencies&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; ignored pleas for help&lt;/a&gt; from Texas officials. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, wrote in emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; just days after&lt;/a&gt; children with measles started getting hospitalized. “We weren’t allowed to do anything,” a CDC official told &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;. It took weeks until any agency officials dispatched to Texas — at which point HHS pressured them to highlight Vitamin A, rather than vaccines, as a solution to the outbreak. (In multiple interviews since January, Secretary Kennedy has claimed that Vitamin A can reduce measles deaths. Studies have consistently found that the salve demonstrates no effect in the greater than 99 percent of Americans who have adequate levels of the vitamin.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“As a health-care professional, that’s scary to hear,” Davies says of being all but abandoned by the federal government. “[But] it makes a big difference to feel supported by your hospital system,” she adds, “to know that they’re in our corner, if nobody else is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Then there are the anti-vax politics — including &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;baseless allegations&lt;/a&gt; made by Robert Malone, a pathologist turned biotechnology executive, on his personal Substack. Malone’s influencer era kicked off in part thanks to a 2021 Joe Rogan interview in which he claimed, without evidence, that antacids cured his case of Covid and that the vaccine could cause narcolepsy. When it came to measles, he claimed that the two deaths from measles were the hospitals’ fault, the result of “medical mismanagement” rather than anything to do with vaccination. Those allegations were never refuted by the administration. And two months after they were posted, Secretary Kennedy appointed Malone as vice chair of the CDC vaccine advisory committee. “It’s impossible not to read some of those comments,” Davies says. Since then, though, she’s tried to stop reading the news.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Despite it all, Davies and her colleagues have pressed on. “We’ve really had tunnel vision: Let’s take care of our patients and do our job, boots on the ground,” she says. And on Aug. 18, the Texas outbreak was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	While that means Covenant’s staff can breathe a little easier — for now — in hindsight, Davies says, “it makes it even harder to know [that] this could have been prevented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Likewise, her experience has made her fear for colleagues across the country. “With the nature of the disease and the high mortality rate from it,” Davies says, “more kids will die.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="purposeful-chaos" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;‘Purposeful chaos’&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Across the country, Davies’ compatriots are steeling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at University of Kansas Medical Center, every child with a cough is “very high stakes” right now. “It’s only a matter of time” until an outbreak happens in his state, too, Hawkinson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Alexandra Cvijanovich, pediatrician at Presbyterian Medical Group in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in today’s environment, “well child checks aren’t always well child checks.” Cvijanovich isn’t leaving any stones unturned: “I always worry: When am I going to have a child in my waiting room who has measles?” she says. The level of vigilance is in part from a deadly measles case she saw during residency that she described as  “the worst death of my pediatric career.” The current outbreak, Cvijanovich says, “has brought back all those memories.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	And to Douglas Fleck, pediatrician and medical director of quality at University Hospital Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s in Ashtabula, Ohio, even figuring out where to put sick patients is “straight-up a challenge.” Fleck doesn’t want to put them in the waiting room because “we take an oath to do no harm,” he says. But he also doesn’t want to turn them away, since that could lead patients who already distrust the health-care system to become even more entrenched. As a result, “we’re dusting off the Covid playbook,” Fleck says — doing as much as they can by telehealth, triaging patients in the parking lot, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Try as they may, all three doctors know their clinics may need help should things get out of hand. But ever since the first days of Trump’s second term, whether counties and states will have the resources to do so remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	One of the earliest threats came on March 24, when HHS summarily terminated $11 billion  in funding to states under the premise that those dollars, initially granted during Covid, were “no longer necessary…now that the pandemic is over,” according to a notice issued by the agency. That “immediately triggered chaos for State and local health jurisdictions,” according to an April 1 lawsuit brought by nearly two dozen states against HHS and RFK Jr. In May, a district court judge ruled in favor of the states; by July, HHS had appealed that ruling. As of this writing , the case continues to snake its way through the courts.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to Sameer Vohra, pediatrician and director of the Illinois Department of Health, HHS’ logic is nonsensical. All the public health measures required to combat Covid — promoting vaccination, purchasing essential equipment, expanding labs, conducting contact tracing, assisting localities during outbreaks — serve as “infrastructure to allow us to be prepared for future emergencies as well,” Vohra says. His state saw nearly $500 million disappear overnight, $125 million of which had already been allocated. “This will have a debilitating impact,” Vohra says , should the federal government win its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In New York, commissioner McDonald is reckoning with similar whiplash. In the immediate aftermath of the clawback, they laid off the majority of contract employees needed to support the department’s efforts. Other states, like Utah and Maine, likewise were forced to fire dozens of employees — further intensifying public health workforce shortages that the federal Government Accountability Office, in January , described as so severe as to threaten the nation’s ability to “conduct key public health functions…[and]respond to emergencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Nationally, public health is really being threatened,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Simultaneously, at the federal level, HHS — the backstop for states in situations of crisis — is roiling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In late March, HHS slashed over 10,000 jobs, closed half its regional offices, and shuttered entire divisions, like those responsible for ensuring workplace safety standards, monitoring levels of environmental toxins, and supporting children with birth defects. National databases upon which public health departments, researchers, and clinicians depend are also fading to black as the data collectors are fired. Some of the gold-standard labs responsible for performing testing on illnesses like measles were shuttered, smack in the middle of the measles outbreak. And the disease detectives responsible for on-the-ground response in places like Texas were gutted, too. Which is perhaps in part why Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, heard crickets in response to her pleas for help in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It is unheard of that, in an active outbreak, [CDC] just says, ‘No…we’re not going to send people,’” Demetre Daskalakis, physician and former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says. “[But] I don’t know who’s left.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“[They] are paralyzing the organization,” Daskalakis adds in reference to the federal government’s actions. “It is purposeful chaos.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For doctors like Fleck in Ashtabula, it’s hard not to notice all of this — or, what it means about how the administration sees public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s hard to feel we’re being supported,” Fleck says. “Actions speak louder than words…and I think there are a lot of actions that they’re taking that raise a red flag.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Still, Fleck will keep seeing the kids with the fevers, the coughs, the rashes. He’ll keep juggling the safety of that child with the others in the waiting room. And, even as it seems the scales are increasingly tilted against him, he’ll keep doing what he does. Because, for kids’ sake, there’s no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Day by day,” Fleck says, “patient by patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;The research, published in the &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343"&gt;journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed dietary habits and health outcomes among tens of thousands of people and found that those who regularly consumed high-fat cheese were less likely to develop dementia than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers examined data from more than 27,000 participants and found that people who consumed high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of all-cause dementia.

Low-fat cheese, low-fat cream, and other low-fat dairy products showed no significant association with dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Cheeses that met the study’s criteria included soft cheeses such as brie and camembert, hard cheeses like cheddar, and semi-soft varieties including Gouda and Gruyère.

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers also observed that participants who consumed more high-fat cheese tended to have a lower prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, and were less likely to use lipid-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She noted that the study focused on a Swedish population, where cheese is more often eaten on its own rather than as part of heavily processed meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Experts emphasized that while the findings are notable, high-fat foods should still be consumed in moderation due to their potential impact on cholesterol and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 224 people are in quarantine amid an outbreak that has sickened 144 people. Most are unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, or CHD, which Kennedy led from&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Kennedy,as%20an%20afterthought." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt; to 2024, produces a daily stream of articles and videos stoking fear about vaccines and falsely suggesting that the risks associated with vaccine-preventable diseases are exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the South Carolina outbreak this month, when more than 200 people were in quarantine, CHD published an article circulating anti-vaccine tropes and arguing that criticism of Kennedy over the spread of measles was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The article says CHD’s chief scientific officer “questioned whether measles needs to be prevented in the first place”. It quoted the host of a CHD.TV show saying it was “absurd” to blame Kennedy for outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CHD did not respond to a Guardian request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As measles spread through the US this year, Kennedy has made statements that undermined confidence in the measles vaccine and the public health response, experts said. In one interview with CBS, he said “people should get the measles vaccine”, but then raised concerns &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=553" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about whether it was adequately safety-tested&lt;/a&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HVk-14n-VRE?t=2020" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;appearance in Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, he said the vaccine waned in effectiveness and was “leaky”, and suggested the case counts in the US were not so bad, compared with larger numbers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR,97%25%20effective%20against%20measles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, is 97% effective. Most people do not experience side-effects and those that do occur are usually mild, like a fever or soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HHS and CDC continue to support strong measles containment through active monitoring and coordination with state and local health departments,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy, said in an email, adding that the US was faring better than Mexico and Canada in its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective protection against measles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said the article published by CHD this month was just the latest example of how the group was working off a familiar anti-vaccine playbook to defend Kennedy, downplay the dangers of disease and exaggerate the risks of vaccines – making it seem that it was worse to get vaccinated than to get sick, when the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These kinds of posts served multiple purposes, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco, who has tracked CHD and Kennedy for years. They were trying to convince themselves and people on the ground that measles was not so bad, while also defending Kennedy and themselves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nobody wants to believe that they’re hurting children,” Reiss said. “They will be blamed for this, and they will be rightly blamed for this, because most of the cases are in the unvaccinated and they have been promoting anti-vaccine misinformation for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said Kennedy’s leadership had hurt efforts to contain measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if he’s not responsible for the actual start of the outbreak, he is most certainly responsible for the spread of the outbreak,” said Amy Pisani, CEO of the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not the first time CHD has mobilized this year around an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year, CHD encouraged people not to get vaccinated and traveled there to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce videos&lt;/a&gt; saying measles wasn’t so dangerous. “Measles is not a grave threat to America’s children,” Mary Holland, chief executive officer, said in one article. It also published videos, articles and social media posts suggesting that the people who died of measles died of something else. Kennedy later echoed CHD’s assertions, suggesting that one child’s death &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263#:~:text=He%20said%20the,two%20weeks%20before.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may have been caused by some other reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She got over the measles, according to her parents, and according to the medical reports, I saw a report on it today, the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection,” he told CBS News. He told Fox News her death was caused by pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pneumonia is one of many possible &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOw7CVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFIbnYyYmtEZGp3bXgzTGNXc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHkxc2DG-fVqPatJsatp4v9fzapThbI32mxsh5PoW4PeLNsqAJVvKvVaSEs6d_aem_CRs2YmnIynERUz7ACplVbw#:~:text=Other%20measles%20symptoms%20may%20include%20small%20spots%20in%20the%20cheek%20area%20inside%20the%20mouth%2C%20diarrhea%20and%20ear%20infection.%20Measles%20can%20lead%20to%20pneumonia%2C%20swelling%20of%20the%20brain%2C%20deafness%2C%20intellectual%20disability%20and%20death." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complications of measles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Those false assertions become a distraction from the reality that vaccines can help keep children alive and protected from disease, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The group’s work is notable at a time when a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cdc-social-media-silence-during-2025-measles-outbreak-left-void-filled-news-media-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found what researchers called an emerging online “health communication void” around measles. They said the CDC had posted just 10 times about measles across three social media platforms between January and August, far less than the average of 45.8 posts during that time frame in the past four years. From 2021 to 2024, 82% of posts promoted routine or “catch-up” measles vaccination, but not a single post from 2025 emphasized routine vaccination, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By contrast, they found CHD posted 101 times about measles on X alone during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In South Carolina, 18 more people have been reported infected since 12 December. State health officials said this week that children from four schools remained in quarantine, and some would be quarantined until 2 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMXliTjl5X3dCejQ5UVNzTnhXXzVJa3FfSURhUTFzOTE5VVJZdlBTdWkzQ3pCOEVVRURsazdlcXhLSEhEb2JoNUcycU00d2xVTElyRTFINVE5SUR3QWV2WEdLMXdtYVZncnFoY21vS0hxNjI1cS1CcDhDdWRXQUlZSGJGYUtWcGppS0R2LW4wNEhnREpG</guid></item><item><title>大约90%的人报告器官移植后的性格变化–为什么？ - IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/around-90-percent-of-people-report-personality-changes-after-an-organ-transplant-why-81969</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strange phenomenon that’s gaining doctors’ attention is the way in which &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/iflscience-we-have-questions-can-transplants-change-your-personality-80631" target="_blank"&gt;organ transplants can change your personality&lt;/a&gt;. A particularly &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-donor-organs-transfer-memory-heart-transplant-patients-report-strange-personality-changes-77153" target="_blank"&gt;unusual case study&lt;/a&gt; involved a woman who, having lived a mostly vegetarian life, found herself suddenly drawn to Kentucky Fried Chicken after receiving a donor heart from someone who loved nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taste changes have been reported among people receiving bone marrow transplants, too, such as the person who went from hating pickles to loving them, and another who switched from white wine to red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplant changes aren’t limited to dietary preferences, either. People have reported a change in preferences for everything from food to music, art, and sexual orientation. So, why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/health-and-medicine/about-us/people/adam-taylor" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, Professor and Director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre at Lancaster University, UK, has questions about, too. Writing for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-an-organ-transplant-really-change-someones-personality-228923" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, he explains how the placebo effect could be a contributing factor as the overwhelming joy of getting a second shot at life leads to a fresh perspective. There is, however, reason to believe that some of these changes could run deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that donor organs are capable of influencing what’s going in the body for many people,” Taylor told IFLScience. “People report these personality changes (sometimes not a complete personality change but little changes) and it's feasible that – because of a transplanted organ – you are going to have changes in your physiology, and those changes in physiology then influence other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality changes have been reported among heart transplant patients, which is a particularly interesting organ to consider. There’s the capacity for a kind of placebo effect, as many cultures consider the heart to be more than just a big pump, forming a part of who we are from bravery to our capacity to love (“she had a heart of stone,” etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart is also a great candidate for altering our physiology, however. Its chambers release peptide hormones that work with our kidneys to regulate fluid in the body, but it can also influence our hypothalamus, acting on our "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-actually-is-fear-find-out-more-in-issue-39-of-curious-out-now-80703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fight or flight&lt;/a&gt;" response and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fn7qhAxPCKs??si=ibI62NXvAC3aAxRO&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the brain requires exposure to various hormones and signalling molecules,” said Taylor. “If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example Taylor gives is that of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antidepressants-all-you-need-to-know-from-serotonin-to-psychedelics-73941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; – often touted as the “happiness molecule”. Most people think it’s all about the brain, but in truth, the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut and it has a systemic effect across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies are reporting somewhere in the region of 90 percent of people who undergo organ transplantation notice a change in personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be said that no organ is an island, and our constituent parts are as interconnected and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/social-frailty-is-a-strong-predictor-of-dementia-but-two-ingredients-can-put-the-brakes-on-cognitive-decline-81659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;interdependent&lt;/a&gt; as we are. It would almost be more surprising, then, if it were possible to replace an organ without noticing some kind of change in your body and in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve a lot still to learn about how much of these self-reported changes are rooted in physiology, or if certain organs are more likely to result in personality changes than others. But with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/organ-transplants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;organ transplants&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, early research suggests we’re going to have a lot more data to work from going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's absolutely something that requires more investigation,” said Taylor. “The problem is that so many more people are now [experiencing this phenomenon] that we're only just beginning to get enough [data] to be able to look at it, but it's definitely a thing. Early studies are reporting somewhere &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3943/5/1/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;in the region of 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people who undergo organ transplantation notice a change in personality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just a heads up if anyone gets my heart: if you don’t like pickles, you soon will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like learning about human anatomy?
