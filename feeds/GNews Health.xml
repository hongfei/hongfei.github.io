			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A man reaching for a protein bar in a shop." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.

But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168676" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

But nearly all of the 10 panelists bucked medical consensus on the drugs’ safety and emphasized what they said were risks of taking the drugs while pregnant — such as causing autism, miscarriages or birth defects. In some cases, they claimed that antidepressants don’t work at all and that depression goes away on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d91b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Three of the 10 panelists were from outside the United States. Another runs a clinic to help people taper off of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-705f71" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were really rousing concerns about safety that are not evidence-based or established and not at all balanced with concerns about the risks of untreated depression,” said Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28e326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Payne, director of the Reproductive Psychiatry Research Program at the University of Virginia, said, “I’m disappointed that the FDA brought people in from outside of the United States when there’s so many experts here in the United States who truly know this [medical] literature inside and out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecf419" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that the claim that the panel was one-sided was “insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers who dedicate their expertise to these panels.” The spokesperson added that FDA Commissioner Martin Makary “has an interest in ensuring policies reflect the latest gold standard science and protect public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb248a" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-ssri-antidepressants-children-doctors-risks-studies-rcna192722" target="_blank"&gt;called for a probe into the risks of antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-children-dire-chronic-disease-health-report-rcna208544" target="_blank"&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” report in May&lt;/a&gt; claimed there were “potentially major long-term repercussions” associated with use of the drugs in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d89ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel discussion focused on a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft. The medications increase levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9556e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists often advise women who are taking SSRIs to continue doing so during pregnancy, since the risks of untreated depression tend to outweigh the potential risks of the medication to mother and child. However, the decision is a personal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-053b05" class="body-graf"&gt;For ethical reasons, there are no randomized-control trials of SSRIs in pregnant women, meaning data on potential risks mostly comes from observational studies and drug registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b232c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some babies born to mothers taking SSRIs may develop symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability or difficulty eating or sleeping that resolve quickly — what’s known as “neonatal adaptation syndrome.” The symptoms may be caused by medication in the babies’ systems or withdrawal from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c32b66" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain studies have also found a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543237/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly elevated risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy, though others have found &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1656691" target="_blank"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no convincing evidence to suggest that SSRIs are linked to autism or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89ccc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Well-controlled studies continue to not find an association,” Payne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2e139" class="body-graf"&gt;Women with histories of depression are also at an increased risk of symptoms’ recurring during pregnancy, and depression can come with its own risks — including thoughts of self-harm or low birth weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1398cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing a pregnant individual could do for herself and her baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt, a perinatal psychiatrist at UMass Chan Medical School, who wasn’t part of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2da935" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to raising concerns about side effects, several panelists questioned the efficacy of antidepressants or suggested that data favoring the use of SSRIs was manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810182" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s been said that SSRIs help people who are severely depressed. They don’t,” said David Healy, an FDA panelist and fellow at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96fb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Goldberg and other psychiatrists said that’s simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1816ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can say the moon landing was faked. Conspiracy theories abound in our world. But there is not a doubt about whether SSRIs work,” said Goldberg, a past president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology who has previously consulted for pharmaceutical companies. He said he was invited to join the FDA panel but declined because the language of the invitation suggested it wouldn’t be a fair discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c6621" class="body-graf"&gt;Healy, the panelist, also claimed that some people “recover spontaneously” from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b538fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another panelist, psychologist Roger McFillin — who hosts a podcast that challenges conventional mental health advice — suggested that depression wasn’t an illness but rather a product of “women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely.” He added, without evidence, that many women feel coerced into taking antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78bd4e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists who weren’t part of the discussion broadly decried those characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0874d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“I have never, ever, ever, ever heard of a third party pushing a prescription in pregnancy,” Goldberg said. However, he said he is aware of some obstetrician-gynecologists who aren’t as familiar with SSRIs who have wrongly told pregnant patients to stop taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26af8" class="body-graf"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday that SSRIs can be lifesaving for some pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-792417" class="body-graf"&gt;“Today’s FDA panel on SSRIs and pregnancy was alarmingly unbalanced and did not adequately acknowledge the harms of untreated perinatal mood disorders in pregnancy,” it said. “On a panel of 10 experts, only one spoke to the importance of SSRIs in pregnancy as a critical tool, among others, in preventing the potentially devastating effects of anxiety and depression when left untreated during pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0dfc4f" class="body-graf"&gt;One panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, a psychiatrist and an OB-GYN at the University of Florida College of Medicine, was the most vocal advocate for using SSRIs, often pushing back against others’ assessments of the risks. Psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel praised her science-backed commentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c96" class="body-graf"&gt;“All of us can find a study that agrees with exactly what we think,” Roussos-Ross told the panel. “But we need to look at the data very objectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032c36" class="body-graf"&gt;Several psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel said they worry that the discussion could lead to regulatory action that makes it harder to access SSRIs.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study is one of the first to examine how these chemicals may disrupt the body's metabolism in ways that increase diabetes risk - particularly in diverse US populations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the researchers used data from BioMe, an electronic health record-linked biobank of more than 65,000 patients seeking primary care at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an initial analysis, 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were selected with this group made up of 33 percent African Americans, 33 percent Hispanics, and 33 percent Whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients were then compared to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood plasma samples collected from the individuals before they were diagnosed with diabetes or given the all-clear were used to assess PFAS levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then applied Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to the samples. This statistical method is used to analyze the effects of mixtures of chemical exposures on a health outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By using WQS, the team were able to see how PFAS levels in the blood were linked to patients developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolic alterations, such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, are key contributors to the development of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes, often linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, disrupt the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyperglycemia occurs when the level of sugar in your blood gets too high. Chronic or persistent hyperglycemia can lead to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of hyperglycemia include feeling thirsty, frequent urination, tiredness and breath that smells fruity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for type 2 typically involves taking insulin several times a day, either by injection or through a pump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say the new findings underscore the importance of regulating PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author, Dr Damaskini Valvi, said: 'Findings can help us design more effective interventions for the early prevention of type 2 diabetes in the future, taking into account individuals' exposures to environmental chemicals along with other well-known genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors implicated in diabetes development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mounting research suggests that PFAS are a risk factor for several chronic diseases, such as obesity, liver disease, and diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public water systems have four years to implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their water, under orders made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beginning in 2029, the EPA will police levels of six types of PFAS in drinking water - PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, and PFBS - and systems with unacceptable levels, will be required to notify the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that US counties where drinking water surpassed this level - such as Nassau, Suffolk, and Rockland in New York and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e0-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, Orange, and Riverside counties in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e1-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - had a higher incidence of digestive, endocrine, respiratory, and mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increases in incidence rates ranged from slightly elevated, at two percent, to 'substantially elevated' at 33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mount Sinai team are now calling for studies involving larger populations, expanding over the life course, in order to better understand the health impacts of PFAS across the lifespan and at vulnerable life periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU (Island News) – COVID-19 activity is yet again on the rise in Hawaii, according to the latest report from the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH’s newest data showed activity at a medium activity level, meaning the virus is circulating at higher levels than would be expected based on historic trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test positivity rate was reported to be 12.4% as of July 19, which is up from 10.9% from the previous week. According to officials, the 7-day average of new cases also rose on all islands over the last month through July 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase reminds us that COVID-19 remains a health concern in the community. At the moment, COVID-19 is outpacing the flu and RSV in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospital admissions,” DOH stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH advises the public to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-3d6e4780-c743-4a74-a38e-43b05d92cb80" data-instance="#gallery-items-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Get the shot&lt;/strong&gt;: DOH encourages everyone age 6 months and older to get vaccinated during the current COVID-19 surge. DOH recommends the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine particularly for the following higher-risk populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children age 6 months to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals age 2 years to 64 years who are immunocompromised (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval of 2 months; and may receive additional doses in discussion with their healthcare provider)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults age 65 years or older (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval 2 of months)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stay home when sick&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay home if you’re feeling sick and return to usual activities only if fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medicines, and symptoms are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Cover your cough&lt;/strong&gt;: Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze helps stop the spread of germs that make you and others sick. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Clean your hands after coughing or sneezing by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Mask up&lt;/strong&gt;: Properly wearing a well-fitted mask when you have or are recovering from COVID-19 symptoms and are indoors with other people can help prevent spread of illness to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Get a test&lt;/strong&gt;: Take a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms and might need treatment because you are at higher risk for severe infection. Many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, but treatments differ. Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 can prevent hospitalization and death. Treatment works best when taken as soon as possible after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;View additional strategies on how to reduce COVID-19 and other respiratory disease spread, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Could frequent use of some cold and allergy medications, and many other common drugs, like those for anxiety, increase your risk of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore that question and why, as you age, you need to change what's in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware of it, but patients are most likely not. Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications could increase your risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We've known about the risk of memory, thinking disorders with these medications for decades,” said Tulane Neurologist Dr. Michele Longo, who has a special interest in memory disorders and sees patients at the UMC Healthy Brain Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medications fall into two classes:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First: Anticholinergic drugs, like some sleep aids and antihistamines like Benadryl, and prescriptions for overactive bladder, asthma, COPD, sleep aids, and motion sickness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second: benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been around for a long time. They are probably one of the more commonly prescribed medications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that when you stop taking the benzos, memory issues tend to go back to normal, but strong anticholinergic drug use is consistently associated with an increased risk of dementia, even after you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons age makes a difference in the medication you take and how much of it you take is that as we get older, our systems slow down, allowing medications to stay in our bodies for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we have to reconsider, look at the medicines and say, ‘Alright, does the benefit of this medicine still outweigh the risks of that medicine?’ And that balance shifts as we age.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don't think that just because a drug is over-the-counter, it means there is no risk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that is marketed in the drug store to help with sleep. You know, I tell my patients to look for “PM.” If it says “PM,” we've got to look closely. Ask the pharmacist,” Dr. Longo recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, she says, bring a list of all the medications you take to your annual exam and let your doctor guide you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some doctors suggest that non-drowsy antihistamines, such as Claritin or Zyrtec, may be safer options for allergies, particularly for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

While HIV infection rates have remained fairly stable, syphilis shows the biggest increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 5 Americans live with such an infection at any given time, with health care costs estimated in the billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And with summer, rates tend to climb, which a &lt;a href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; using CDC data by Invigor Medical attributes to increased social activity, travel and sexual behavior when the weather’s warmer. But there are other factors, including varying levels of access to health care, different levels of sexual health education, differences in screening and its utilization and persistent social and economic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Invigor Medical reports chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, with more than 1.6 million new cases in 2023, especially prominent among young women. Gonorrhea cases nearly doubled in the decade, to roughly 595,000. Syphilis increased sixfold from 34,279 cases to more than 205,000, though that may be a little misleading. Before 2018, the CDC didn’t include late-stage or unknown stage syphilis in its counts. Even so, the report said if you exclude those cases, the count still tripled over the decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s all bad news. The good news, per the report, is the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections may be slowing. Per the report, “While syphilis infections remain at record highs, reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV have declined from their peak levels in previous years, signaling a promising shift in the trajectory of the nation’s STD burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Men-vs.-women-and-infection-rates" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Men vs. women and infection rates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The analysis found that women are about 10% more likely to be diagnosed with an STD, compared to men. Among those 13 and older, there were 902 reported infections per 100,000 women, compared to 819 per 100,000 men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap is most pronounced for adolescents and young adults, per the report, which said that there are biological differences that make women more susceptible, but it could also be a case of doing a better job of counting. Women are more likely to be screened and screened younger during routine reproductive health visits. Men tend to be tested if they have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="State-by-state-count" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;State by state count&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The highest counts of STDs are currently found in the South, with Louisiana and Mississippi reporting the highest rates at 1,201.6 and 1,084.5 cases per 100,000, respectively. Two other states also report STD rates above 1,000 per 100,000: Alaska (1066.6) and Georgia (1020.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1450" data-height="1200"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=662" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1324 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt; Invigor Medical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other Southern states in the top 10 are Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas, while New York and South Dakota also make that top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;New England states typically have the lowest STD rates, per the report. Vermont (241). New Hampshire (251.1) and Maine (276.6) have one-fourth the infection rate of those in the highest burden states. “New England states tend to be older and have less ethnic diversity, both of which are associated with lower STD risk,” per Invigor Medical. The region also tends to have higher median income and a lower uninsured rate, so it’s easier to get tested and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Filling out the bottom 10, Oregon ranks No. 41, Connecticut, No. 42 and Montana No. 43. Utah ranks No. 44 for states with highest rates of sexually transmitted disease, then Wyoming (No. 45), Idaho (No. 46), and West Virginia (No. 47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Utah-STD-numbers" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Utah STD numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, Utah had 429.6 newly reported STD cases per 100,000 residents, making it seventh-best in terms of having low STD rates. Nationally, there were 746.7 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of those cases in Utah, chlamydia accounted for 11,004, for a rate of 322 per 100,000, making its chlamydia rate seventh-lowest in the U.S. The national chlamydia rate was 492.2 per 100,000 with 1,648,568 new cases total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There were 77.9 new gonorrhea cases in Utah per 100,000 residents, eighth-lowest. In all, there were 2,664 new cases. Nationally, the 601,319 cases created a rate of 179.5 cases per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was sixth-lowest for syphilis, with a rate of 24.2 cases per 100,000 residents and 828 total cases. Nationally, the numbers were 205,371 cases and a rate of 61.3 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was 12th lowest for HIV, with 153 new cases, which came out to 5.5 cases per 100,000 residents. In the U.S. overall, the 38,793 cases reported created a rate of 13.7 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report includes 354 U.S. metro areas and all 50 states.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) is confirming a case of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of Naegleria fowleri--the scientific term for the amoeba--was identified the week of July 7th but the agency hasn't said where in the state it was found.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 started looking into these claims after reports circulated in local Facebook groups suggesting a child in the Midlands may have died from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 reached out to the Centers for Disease Control, local hospitals, several coroner's offices, and the state's environmental department, but no one could confirm a death or a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCDPH did confirm the case but said it's not required to be reported to their agency. "The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person's condition," SCDPH officials clarified in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The agency stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the amoeba are naturally occurring, there is no way to prevent them in lakes or rivers. The amoeba is only life-threatening if it goes up the nose and to the brain. It is not delay if ingested through the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says early symptoms of the amoeba infection include fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Those cases usually progress rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;More than 40% of U.S. adults are considered obese. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors and health experts say there are different types of fat. Some are more dangerous than others, so it's important to know what type you're carrying around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous fat is the type just beneath the skin that you can pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the more dangerous kind, visceral fat, is buried deep within the abdomen. It's typically stored around your belly and can wrap itself around your organs, trigger inflammation, and contribute to several health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visceral fat has shown to increase all major chronic diseases," said Julia Zumpano, registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of that deep belly fat can help you be healthier, and experts say being active is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're sitting at a desk all day and we're only doing 30 minutes of exercise, but we're doing it every day, it's still really not enough for most people," Zumpano explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say work movement into your daily life. Trying a walking desk, taking breaks to go for a walk, doing squats at your desk, wearing a weighted vest, taking the stairs, or parking further away all can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key? A healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Belly fat can be increased by artificial and sugary foods," said Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, be sure to steer away from sweets and toward whole foods, like lean sources of protein and fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plant-based diets, Mediterranean diets, have been shown to be very helpful when it comes to reducing inflammation and visceral fat," Zumpano added.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s something that will make you lose just a bit more faith in humanity—or at least reach for some hand wipes. New research shows that even in hospitals, a substantial number of people aren’t bothering to wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Surrey in England led the study, installing sensors near hospital toilet and sink pipes to keep track of people’s handwashing. Nearly half of toilet users skipped the sink after flushing, they found. The researchers say more effective strategies are needed to remind and convince people of the importance of handwashing, particularly in high-risk environments like hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have tried to analyze how rigorous people are about handwashing in hospitals and other settings, but they’ve been limited. Some have relied on asking people to self-report their hygiene habits, for instance, which &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136445"&gt;might incentivize&lt;/a&gt; more than a few to fudge the truth. The researchers decided to take a different approach. They connected sensors to toilet and sink pipes that could objectively and non-intrusively detect if and when they were being used. The sensors work by measuring the temperature in the pipes and nearby air; when either cold or hot water passes through the pipes, the temperature sharply changes relative to its surroundings, indicating use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers teamed up with the Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark to conduct their study (aptly named the “FLUSH. WASH. PROTECT.” study). For 19 weeks, they tracked people’s handwashing behaviors at two public restrooms in the hospital, ultimately recording more than 2,600 flushes. Nearly 44% of the time after flushing, people steered clear of handwashing. At times, non-adherence was even worse, with over 60% of people not handwashing during certain weeks. Non-handwashing was also more common at the start and end of the day and during typical meal times. The team &lt;a href="https://osf.io/befvt"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its findings last week on the Open Source Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“People may assume handwashing is second nature by now—especially in hospitals and post-covid-19—but our data paints a different picture,” said lead author Pablo Pereira-Doel, co-leader of the Human Insight Lab at the University of Surrey’s Business School, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091556"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low rates of handwashing can, of course, make it easier for doctors, patients, and visitors to inadvertently spread dangerous infections to already vulnerable people, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;drug-resistant superbugs.&lt;/a&gt; Some studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483670/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that certain interventions, like clear signs, can modestly boost handwashing at hospitals, at least temporarily. But given the results here, it’s likely we’ll need to do a lot more to consistently improve people’s hand hygiene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings are worrying but not surprising. Even simple behaviors like handwashing can lapse without reinforcement. In hospitals, lapses like these can have serious consequences—for patients and for the wider healthcare system. It’s time we moved beyond posters and hand gel stations to more effective behavioral strategies,” said study author Carrie Newlands, Lead for Clinical Skills at the University of Surrey’s School of Medicine, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wouldn’t blame you (or myself) for avoiding the standard handshake more often. And just in case anyone needs it, here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;proper technique&lt;/a&gt; for handwashing, courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Photographs have been circulating online for years that supposedly depict where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet. In the photographs, there is a clearly visible line between the two, and the water on each side of the line is a different color. This has led to online speculation that the two oceans actually don't mix at all. But is that really the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet off the southernmost tip of South America, between that continent and Antarctica. Prior to the Panama Canal, this was the passage most ships took to get from one ocean to the other since the passage to the north, through Canada, had too much hazardous ice. Islands litter this area of water, and it is here that the oceans not only meet, but also mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Much of our oceans are still a big mystery to us due to the challenges of oceanic exploration. The Atlantic Ocean cooling at a record speed, the long-term effects of glaciers melting, and even the type of sea life found in the great trenches are all mysteries to study. Despite the challenges, ocean science has been able to monitor where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet, mix, and what factors contribute to how fast they merge together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;David Merron Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are a few factors that influence the speed at which the two oceans mix. The Pacific Ocean is less salty than the Atlantic Ocean, which prevents them from mixing smoothly. The water between the islands off South America tends to be slower, which reduces the speed of the oceans mixing. However, the waters closer to Antarctica are rougher and the waves bigger, which actually speeds up the process further south. The two oceans will also blend together on the seafloor, where the daily changes of the tides influence their speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Climate change is having an effect on the rate at which the oceans mix. Human pollution has had a detrimental impact on the waters of the planet. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such impact that is clearly visible. Although a plastic-eating fungus is naturally helping to clean it up, it's not able to do so faster than we can pollute. Climate change has resulted in melting ice in Antarctica, which alters the density of the water and thus slows the rate at which the oceans mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the oceans actually do mix, why do we see two distinct colors where they meet? The most likely cause is the waters of two different temperatures coming together. The colder water around Antarctica meets up with the warmer water from the north, and there is a visible contrast when they come together. The saltier water of the Atlantic Ocean may also be a contributory factor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These days, if people online don't believe a photo is real, they assume it is created by AI. Given the increasingly realistic nature of AI images, it can be hard to tell what is real and what isn't — especially with new technology that will use AI to turn memories into photos. However, even before AI was everywhere, photos posted online could still be confusing and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A photo taken in 2007 that circulated around for years appeared to depict a permanent line in the water where two oceans met but never mixed. The photo — factchecked &lt;a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/two-oceans-meet/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by Snopes — was reportedly posted by University of California-Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences, Ken Bruland, during his research in the Gulf of Alaska. It caused a great deal of speculation online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What was seen was actually water with heavy sediment from glacial rivers meeting up with the ocean. This caused a difference in color and slowed down the waters blending together. It was not a permanent line, and the waters did eventually mix. &lt;/p&gt;

But why should you pay attention to these specific types of foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is one of our most important organs for our overall health—so taking care of it should be a top priority, according to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1407112998" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Leah Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian at NYU Langone Health. “The liver has many functions, but one of which is to eliminate wasteful substances from the body in the form of bile,” Kaufman says. “Therefore, it is important to keep your liver healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unhealthy liver can cause more health problems in the long run, so there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when taking care of it. She recommends &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-happens-when-you-stop-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;avoiding excess alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, high fatty foods, and simple sugars as the best way to keep your liver clean and functioning well. You’ll also want to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/brain-health-exercises" target="_blank"&gt;exercise regularly&lt;/a&gt; and pick healthy foods. Here are Kaufman's picks for the best, liver-friendly foods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman recommends including a variety of foods filled with antioxidants into your diet to help cleanse the liver and decrease toxins. Studies show that foods like blueberries are not only rich with antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals, but they also have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;inhibit the growth of cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens and Cruciferous Veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are another food that is rich in antioxidant properties, says Kaufman. Foods like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kale-juice" target="_blank"&gt;Kale&lt;/a&gt;, cabbage, and arugula are also great sources of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chlorophyll-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;, which is a natural compound that is known for its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;detox properties&lt;/a&gt; and ability to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;enhance liver function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous veggies, which include broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, are also known to boost liver health and protect the liver cells. A study done on mice shows that broccoli played a major role in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27672403/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing the risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are another food that Kaufman said is rich in antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals and help it cleanse out impurities from the body. Studies also show that tomatoes can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6308920/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of fatty liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis, scarring of the liver, or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman also recommends beets as an antioxidant-rich food you can turn to for your liver. Studies show that beet juice can protect the liver from &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free radical damage&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress. It can also &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the fat&lt;/a&gt; that might grow around the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From lowering cholesterol to lowering the risk of certain diseases, flaxseeds come with loads of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/flaxseeds" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman likes the food for your liver as it is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which studies show can help &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1098882324000327" target="_blank"&gt;reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; that may grow around the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon and Other Fatty Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another food rich in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; is fatty fish, which include salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and tuna. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3257651/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman agrees and especially recommends salmon for the liver. Known as the ultimate anti-aging beauty food (and a favorite amongst &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day#:~:text=Salmon%20is%20rich%20in%20DHA,and%20reducing%20inflammation%20and%20cholesterol." target="_blank"&gt;many celebs&lt;/a&gt;), salmon is known to be good for your brain and gut health while also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5019889/" target="_blank"&gt;lowering liver fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need more reason to justify your daily cup of joe, studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent many different types of liver diseases. One study done in 2016 shows that coffee can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862107/" target="_blank"&gt;lower the risk of fatty liver disease,&lt;/a&gt; and another study done in the same year shows that drinking two cups of coffee may help &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26806124/" target="_blank"&gt;protect from permanent liver damage&lt;/a&gt; if you’re already dealing with chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Olive Oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-cooking-oil" target="_blank"&gt;best cooking oils,&lt;/a&gt; and you can even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;drink it daily.&lt;/a&gt; Olive oil is a powerhouse and comes with many health benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; fighting diabetes, boosting heart and gut health, strengthening bones, and reducing high blood pressure. As for the liver, studies show that olive oil can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141573/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation and fat around the liver&lt;/a&gt; and lower elevated liver enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garlic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of adding flavor to any dish, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; is packed with minerals, sulfur compounds, vitamins A and C, and fiber to promote health and prevent disease. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;It is known&lt;/a&gt; to boost your immunity, protect against inflammation, may protect against certain cancers, and lower blood pressure. It also makes for one of the best liver detox foods out there. Studies show that garlic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;can help reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; around the organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk of liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus Fruits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you drink orange juice daily as part of your breakfast meal or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-reasons-why-lemon-water-is-the-perfect-start-to-your-day" target="_blank"&gt;drink water with lemon&lt;/a&gt;, citrus fruits are great for flushing out toxins in your liver. Studies show that drinking orange juice daily can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339791/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce your risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;so much nutritional value&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll find antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin E, and healthy fats to name just a few), and they make for a great snack option or added garnish to a meal. Some &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; include maintaining or lowering cholesterol levels, reducing inflammation, and helping us maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your liver, preliminary studies show that nuts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731785/#sec21" target="_blank"&gt;may have a positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on reducing the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. But more studies are needed to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:50:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5scjh1WG0zQ0VfRUZJWHFadXBGWEcwcE84Q3J0SGY0a0pLd1F0aU83MVpScVNrV25VYnF0MS1aN3BFeW5yX3hyQl90cTl1YXlVLTZRR1hRV1BVWmM0UDc4Rl8xZ3cxTkpZVkE</guid></item><item><title>自闭症掩蔽在大脑上留下痕迹-神经科学新闻 | Autism Masking Leaves a Mark on the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9VOEF5cUxEUkF0dF9VUjNQRmh5WHUyZ3pKeUNjalNzOFBTcFdlUkVKOTU3NWtLTDJBNUQwQUMyVU50RkJsTU9lZTZXd2YyQVI5X2pGLXQ5VWVuX3NUbDhIcW1yODVYTEZaTlNaWg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Some autistic teens mask their traits to “pass” as non-autistic in social settings, but a new study reveals the hidden cognitive toll. Using EEG, researchers found these teens show faster automatic responses to faces and dampened emotional reactivity, suggesting their brains may adapt to cope with social demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first direct evidence of how masking manifests in brain activity, shedding light on its mental cost. The findings could improve identification and support for autistic teens who go unnoticed in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Differences Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who mask autism show faster facial recognition and muted emotional response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Masking:&lt;/strong&gt; 44% of autistic teens in the study passed as non-autistic in classrooms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings highlight the need to better identify and support masked autistic teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Drexel University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some autistic teens often adopt behaviors to mask their diagnosis in social settings helping them be perceived — or “pass” — as non-autistic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers are able to observe brain functions that differ in those who “pass as non-autistic,” which could lead to a better understanding of the cognitive toll of this kind of masking, and of how these individuals could be more effectively supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brainwaves, researchers from Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute found that teens who pass as non-autistic in school settings showed faster automatic responses to faces and reduced emotional reactivity to subtle emotional facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111818"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg" alt="This shows heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could play a key role in ensuring autistic teens, who may not feel comfortable revealing their diagnosis, can still receive the support they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that their brains may be wired to quickly recognize social cues while dampening emotional responses, either as a preparatory or coping mechanism,” said Matthew Lerner, PhD, associate professor, leader of the Life Course Outcomes Research Program, and director of the Social Connections and Treatment Lab in the Autism Institute and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings offer the first direct evidence of how brain activity might differ in those who pass as non-autistic, shedding light on the hidden mental effort behind social masking in autism. The findings could reshape how we understand the mental toll of masking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports,&lt;/em&gt; revealed that 44% of community-recruited autistic teens passed as non-autistic in the classroom – meaning their teachers would not have noticed or identified them as autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were in the “passed as non-autistic” group showed faster initial brain response when looking at faces and showed less emotionally reactive brain response to subtle emotions in faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner explained that these findings reveal, for the first time, some of the ways in which autistic teens who pass as non-autistic process social information in unique ways, which differ both from non-autistic teens and autistic teens who do not pass as non-autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These datasets were collected as part of a larger National Institute of Mental Health-funded study examining factors impacting social outcomes in autistic teens. Importantly, this study focused on recruiting a broad population from the community, including those who did not necessarily have an autism diagnosis in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner added that this allowed for inclusion of teens who meet criteria for autism by formal diagnostic processes but may not otherwise have an existing diagnosis or supports in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team explained that the “passing as non-autistic” group was identified by looking at the difference between autism features as displayed in a gold-standard diagnostic setting and those displayed in classrooms (according to teachers) and at home (according to parents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allowed for more clearly defining what we mean by ‘passing,’ because those youth who did so both unambiguously met criteria for autism by gold-standard measures and did not show any significant hints of autism in the classroom according to their teachers,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EEG measurements were taken during a standardized procedure where participants were shown a set of faces and asked to rate their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their event-related potential responses — the small “blips” in the brainwave that indicate a brain’s response to stimuli (the faces) — provided information about how a person differentiates a face from a non-face object, and how a person regulates their emotional response to a stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this will spur greater inquiry into identifying autistic youth who are ‘passing as non-autistic,’ determining what cognitive efforts are involved in this, and developing improved ways to support the lives of those who are doing so,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1e12144a4d4d3f1b0d1a071a13511a1b0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annie Korp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annie Korp – Drexel University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-04801-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Automatic and affective processing of faces as mechanisms of passing as non-autistic in adolescence&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew D.

&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough drug is fighting brain cancer head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/02/fighting-glioblastoma-one-of-the-deadliest-forms-of-brain-cancer/"&gt;killing over 10,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; each year. There is no cure for the highly aggressive disease — many patients &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9265012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;survive just nine months&lt;/a&gt; after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and extending life via surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and radiation therapy and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) are &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recruiting glioblastoma patients&lt;/a&gt; for a trial of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab. Sold under the brand name Yervoy, the monoclonal antibody stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologists are optimistic since a 43-year-old UK father shows no signs of having a tumor — he took ipilimumab before his glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” said Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist leading the trial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We saw with Ben, the one patient recruited to the immunotherapy study, NeAT-GLIO, that he has had clear scans since having the treatment and the tumor hasn’t returned more than two and a half years later.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, killing over 10,000 Americans each year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Trotman met with Mulholland, who enrolled him in a clinical trial for ipilimumab. He was the first patient in the world — and the only person in the trial — to take the drug before glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” said Trotman’s wife, Emily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug, Ben underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months later, his scans are clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben and Emily Trotman wed in 2023, after he began his immunotherapy treatment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of UCLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay,” he added, “and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, months after his diagnosis, Ben married Emily. The couple welcomed a daughter, Mabel, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They enjoy taking her for walks along with their rescue dog, Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to live as normal a life as possible,” Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in a unique position of which there is no precedent and which comes with a great deal of uncertainty,” she continued. “We want to live each day as if it were our last, but we also want to plan for the future, which we hope to have.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to recruit 16 glioblastoma patients like Ben over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking ipilimumab, the trial participants will undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and perhaps surgery depending on the extent of their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland (left) is pictured with Dame Siobhain McDonagh, who raised funds for the new clinical trial of ipilimumab. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is being funded by Dame Siobhain McDonagh, a member of the British Parliament, whose sister died of glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma,” McDonagh said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that this new trial, with the same immunotherapy drug I received, is going ahead and others will have the opportunity to take part,” Ben said. “It will give people newly diagnosed with glioblastoma some hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

Just days later, he celebrated his 17th birthday in the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries after developing sepsis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1466049471406647" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aneurin Bevan University Health Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aneurin Bevan University Health Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as a "medical emergency" by the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12361-sepsis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis occurs when your immune system has a "dangerous reaction to an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-09-2020-who-calls-for-global-action-on-sepsis---cause-of-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis is the cause of one in five deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mullins, his experience with sepsis started after he did something many others do on a regular basis — popped a pimple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geraint Mullins&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I enjoy popping [pimples] - and when I popped it, it was just a normal [pimple]," Mullins, now 24, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nx3gzr1no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Mullins was left with a golfball-sized abscess on his neck, which he said developed "within a few days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he started feeling "very lethargic" and "quite out of it," Mullins went to his doctor, who sent him to the hospital to undergo surgery. The surgical procedure helped drain the abscess. However, the infection was still raging a week later, which led to a secondary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, he still has a scar on his neck. However, the outcome could have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very close to potentially not being here," he told the outlet. "If I wasn't as fit, I could have been dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Mullins said that he "knew absolutely nothing" about the possibility of the deadly illness. Now, he's committed to raising awareness about what sepsis looks like and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that some of the warning signs of sepsis include "slurred speech," "extreme shivering," "severe breathlessness," and "mottled" skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the WHO, "only half of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis "will completely recover.

So you really want to squeeze it just enough so you get a little tinge of blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, "Know when to pop and when to stop."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-popped-his-pimple-hospitalized-days-later-sepsis-11775701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB6aV9MalJHdGRjdmdrUHJLMFU4dWo4YXlGU0gzOEFMeEpPZjZLa0x0SWFjTEpNYnlTMUpaaUQ4TXNtRVMxU0JlVng5eUdPS01rblI2WXRJaS1abkp0TjMtVWU3bjBzdVpDZGFtVUV3dzlPS0tSVmlObkpWRktMQQ</guid></item><item><title>官员表示，拿骚县的狂犬病宣布“迫在眉睫的公共卫生威胁” -新闻日报 | Rabies in Nassau County declared 'imminent public health threat,' officials say - Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5aNW9zcENuVVdPZTF4Tjl1OWxnaW0talJiaVZvMm9JNHN3eURPcThWb1JTb1JJaTV0a0FxS3pBUF9SNUtoY2w3QU1sWF90aXdVcWNiVjd5ZGgyTlotNF9QQ2FlUV9RQ1FZVm1aVDFNdmc4NUg5akN6ei1SLTYxZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="continue-reading ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is now an "imminent public health threat" in Nassau County, officials said Monday, warning residents to stay away from wild animals and to protect their pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance shows the virus is circulating throughout the county, which has collected and confirmed 25 rabid animals since July 2024. That number includes both raccoons and feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid raccoons have also been discovered in Suffolk County this year, predominantly in the Amityville area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a rare but deadly disease that can be passed to humans by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have contact with a rabid animal but receive prompt treatment can avoid serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resurgence of rabies in Nassau County, with its high population density and after nearly a decade of absence, represents a serious and evolving public health concern," Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman said in a statement. "This declaration allows us to respond to prevent further spread and protect the health and safety of Nassau County residents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the declaration allows the county to secure resources and conduct activities to address and abate the threat, officials said. That includes spreading rabies vaccine baits in areas where infected animals have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is urged not to feed or touch wild animals, stray cats or dogs. In addition, it's important to make sure pets — including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses and livestock — are vaccinated against rabies, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Department of Health asks anyone whose pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal to contact them and report any dead, sick or abnormally acting animal by emailing rabies@nassaucountyny.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Rubin, an anesthesiologist who led the study, and others wrote: 'We demonstrated that an increase of 14 steps per minute during the intervention sessions increased the odds of an improvement in [endurance].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Older adults can increase their [steps per minute] and [steps per minute] can serve as a surrogate measure of activity intensity during walking interventions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Average adults walk about 100 to 130 steps per minute, according to estimates, while older and frail individuals walk about 82 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American also walks about 5,100 steps per day, well below the recommendation of 10,000 every 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, researchers recruited adults from 14 retirement homes near the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study defined a frail adult as an individual with weight loss, slowness, weakness, exhaustion and someone who undertook little physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants, only 35 percent were able to walk unaided with the remainder requiring a cane, walker, scooter or wheelchair at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were divided into two equal groups for walking sessions, the fast group or the relaxed group, with each led by a trained research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adults in the exercise group saw a greater improvement than those in the relaxed group (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the first three sessions, adults were asked to walk 45 minutes at a comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the next eight sessions, participants were asked to walk 40 minutes, and start and end each session with five minutes of stair tapping — stepping and quickly tapping the toes of each foot on the edge of a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the walking, those in the fast-walking group were also asked to increase their intensity until they reached 70 percent of their heart rate maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart rate maximum is the highest number of times the heart can beat in one minute during strenuous physical activity. It is calculated using the formula of 220 minus someone's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in the study, their maximum heart rate would be around 147 beats per minute and 70 percent of this would be 103 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the remaining sessions, participants were asked to walk for 35 minutes but begin each session with a 10-minute warm up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But those in the exercise group were asked to incrementally increase their speed during the walking sessions to 'as fast as they safely could.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants' walking was tracked using an activPAL tracker that was strapped onto their thigh, which measured steps and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were able to stop to rest during the exercises, but this stopped the timer, which would not restart until they began to walk again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that among those in the relaxed group, their steps decreased during the study from 82 to 77 steps per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, those in the exercise group saw this rise from 86 to 100 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete the six-minute walk test at the start and end of the study to measure their endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the relaxed group, participants saw a slight improvement, with the distance they walked increasing from 836 to 869 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, however, those in the exercise group saw the distance they walked increase from 843 to 1,033 feet per session - a 10 percent rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, the average American adult can walk around 2,100 feet in six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'The overall exercise dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) between the two groups only differed with respect to the intensity component as frequency and duration were kept constant between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thus, prefrail and frail older adults engaged in walking interventions can derive further improvement in their functional outcomes by increasing [steps per minute] during a fixed volume of walking exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He urged Republicans to pressure the White House to constrain Kennedy “or fire him”. If Americans die unnecessarily, Bloomberg said, Senate Republicans will pay at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The upheaval in vaccine policy comes as the CDC is tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an historic&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak that began in an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;under-vaccinated community&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. More than 1,300 confirmed measles cases have been reported since mid-July – though experts believe the true tally is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;far higher&lt;/a&gt;. That is the worst case count &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 1992&lt;/a&gt; at only halfway through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. A supremely effective vaccine, preventing 97% of cases with two doses, meant it was nevertheless eliminated in 2000. Experts now believe the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two healthy children and an adult.

	&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches, which are about 89% water, outshine their stone-fruit counterparts like plums and nectarines in terms of hydration, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). They also pack in similar antioxidant benefits with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watermelon and cantaloupe top the charts for highest water content, but peaches follow closely behind, according to the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fruits that hydrate while also providing electrolytes can help the body better replace and retain fluids than water alone, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuzzy fruits offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of these nutrients help support digestion, heart health, and immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A medium raw peach contains about 285 milligrams of potassium, an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in nerve function, muscle contraction, fluid balance, heart health, and blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more potassium than many popular electrolyte supplements and about 8.4% of the daily recommended intake for men and 11% recommended for women, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. residents consume too little potassium, which increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Peaches offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients, according to reports. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;alter_photo – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches are also heart-healthy options thanks to their antioxidant content. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They contain flavonoids, which help lower the risk of heart disease and support memory and cognition, and carotenoids, which can help fight inflammation and protect and restore skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early studies have indicated that the antioxidants can have potential anti-cancer effects, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth (not pictured), a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flavonoids and carotenoids also give peaches their distinct color.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches combine two groups of pigments that you don’t often see together in other fruits and vegetables,” Mary Ann Lila, a distinguished professor in the Plants for Human Health Institute at North Carolina State University, told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw peaches with their skin also provide about 4% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin A and 13% of the daily vitamin C needed, plus a few grams of fiber to aid digestion and gut health, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those trying to limit sugar intake, pairing peaches – which contain up to 13 grams of natural sugar – with protein or healthy fats is key.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pavel Lysenko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach helps slow down sugar absorption and stabilizes blood sugar levels, added Sheth, who’s also a certified diabetes care and education specialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can add chopped peaches to your morning toast with nut butter or into your cereal or yogurt bowl, blend it into a smoothie or try grilling peaches with a sprinkle of spice,” she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

COVID-related emergency room visits for young kids are also the highest they've been since March, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;COVID-19 cases are growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C., as of July 15, 2025, the CDC says. / Credit: CBS News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook told "CBS Mornings" Monday this is typical of what we've come to understand about summer spikes in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now know that there's a winter spike and then there's a summer spike," he said. "And every year, I just looked last night, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that's the good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, people shouldn't ignore the increases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it strikes you, especially for the vulnerable, and we're talking about very young children under age of 4, the elderly, people who are immunocompromised — there are millions of people who are immunocompromised out there — they can really get sick," LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New COVID variants Nimbus and Stratus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest COVID variants, nicknamed Nimbus and Stratus, are "no more deadly" than &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous variants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous variants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on previous variants, like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-variant-nb181-1-in-3-cases-cdc/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NB.1.8.1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from earlier this year, for example, also did not show more severe illness compared to previous variants. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, too, including respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccines that were made for this season do cover the current variants, so that's good news," LaPook said. "I think the bottom line here is: Don't be blasé. It's the summer, people have all sorts of things. Be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I get a COVID vaccine booster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps protect you;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps protect you&lt;/a&gt; from "severe illness, hospitalization and death," there have been some shifts in recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaPook admits we're in a bit of an odd period right now because the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC has different vaccine recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC has different vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than many of the major health organizations and societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, says pregnant people should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the baby ... before they can get a shot, they're really relying on the mother's immunity — the mother has the antibodies, goes through the placenta, and then the baby has some protection," LaPook explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. "said it's now shared decision making," LaPook said. "So that means that go talk to your clinician about it, which is always a good idea, but it's a little bit of a different recommendation than just saying, 'go get it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also now recommends "shared clinical decision-making" for giving healthy children the COVID-19 vaccine. While the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:currently recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;currently recommends&lt;/a&gt; most adults aged 18 and older get a 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, it says it's especially important if you're 65 and older, at high risk for severe COVID-19 or have never received a COVID-19 shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where COVID-19 cases are growing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases are growing in these states, according to the CDC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ArkansasHawaiiIllinoisIowaKentuckyNorth CarolinaOhioPennsylvaniaTexasVirginiaWhere COVID-19 cases are likely growing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says COVID-19 cases are likely growing in the following places:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlaskaCaliforniaDelawareDistrict Of ColumbiaGeorgiaIndianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMississippiNew JerseyNew YorkOklahomaSouth CarolinaTennesseeWisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/what-shocked-matlock-star-kathy-bates?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:What shocked "Matlock" star Kathy Bates?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What shocked "Matlock" star Kathy Bates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/a-new-you-the-science-of-redesigning-your-personality?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new you: The science of redesigning your personality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A new you: The science of redesigning your personality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/somebody-somewhere-star-bridget-everett?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Somebody Somewhere" star Bridget Everett;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"Somebody Somewhere" star Bridget Everett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:33:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE95TnF3SE5wNjFvZG85Zkg4RHZnUzV2MEk0ZHRBYldpcndNTlljcG01aDhJNjZ6bmlGTUw3b29jLWM1Q3ZkNXNJOFg0MUFpUWhPUWU1QmJrdzJUcDJkX19RRERuSXM1c3E0UV84Zlh0RzA</guid></item><item><title>您能否对身体呈阳性并服用Ozempic ？我做到了，但只是为了疼痛，而不是减肥。原因如下：每周骑自行车 | Can you be body-positive and take Ozempic?

&lt;p&gt;I made my name in cycling as an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;unapologetically fat endurance rider&lt;/a&gt;. For years, I have advocated for plus-size riders, and the need for bigger cycling clothing, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits"&gt;improved transparency on weight limits,&lt;/a&gt; and inclusive riding communities. My journey was even chronicled in a 2021 documentary by Shimano, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies on Bikes&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which led to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;creation of a nonprofit &lt;/a&gt;dedicated to size inclusion, an organization I now proudly lead as Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never let my body size or weight limit me. I have completed five &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;Unbound Gravel&lt;/a&gt; races at over 250 pounds, yet I’ll be the first to admit that my weight has made life challenging over the years. From needing a seatbelt extender on airplanes to ongoing knee pain, life as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/im-a-fat-cyclist-these-are-the-top-3-misconceptions-people-have-about-bigger-riders-and-why-theyre-wrong" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/im-a-fat-cyclist-these-are-the-top-3-misconceptions-people-have-about-bigger-riders-and-why-theyre-wrong"&gt;bigger bodied athlete &lt;/a&gt;is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;After an unsuccessful knee surgery in 2023 led to chronic pain, my orthopedic surgeon recommended weight loss as a solution. But throughout my life, I’ve tried just about every diet out there. Counting calories, cutting carbs, Weight Watchers—you name it. None ever led to lasting results. Instead, I live an active lifestyle and have come to a place of genuine self-love and acceptance with my body. I wasn’t interested in pursuing intentional weight loss again, especially not just to change a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;But, as my doctor explained, this was about the impact of carrying extra body weight on my joints. Given my lifelong struggles with dieting, he suggested there might be an underlying issue contributing to my body size and recommended I see an endocrinologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That referral marked the beginning of my journey with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt;—a class of medications originally developed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but now increasingly prescribed for weight management. At first, I was very hesitant. These drugs, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, have sparked heated debates about body image, diet culture, and what it means to pursue “health.” But for me, this wasn’t about chasing a thinner body or losing weight, per se. It was about relieving pain and staying on the bike for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As it turned out, I had insulin resistant PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects up to 1 in 10 people with ovaries, though it often goes undiagnosed. One of the lesser-known but significant effects of PCOS is how it can impact metabolism and weight. Many people with PCOS experience insulin resistance, meaning our bodies struggle to use insulin effectively, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. This metabolic imbalance makes it easier to gain weight and significantly harder to lose it, even with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. This explained why I was seemingly doing everything “right,” that is, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826"&gt;eating a balanced diet &lt;/a&gt;and exercising frequently, while still carrying excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As a p&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;ublic figure who cultivates weight-neutral cycling spaces&lt;/a&gt; and communities, taking a GLP-1 felt antithetical to my identity. If my body changed on this medication, which was likely to happen, would I be betraying my values? Would I be sending the wrong message to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;All Bodies on Bikes &lt;/a&gt;community? What does it mean to advocate for body acceptance while making a choice that may lead to weight loss and body changes for myself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;What’s more, how would it impact me on the bike?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The side effects of GLP-1s have been widely talked about: nausea, fatigue, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) and more. I got lucky and only experienced mild nausea and constipation, however, the impact on my appetite was huge. I suddenly had almost zero hunger signals. A banana at breakfast would satiate me until lunch, when half a peanut butter sandwich would fill me up. Which to be clear, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough food for anyone, let alone &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains"&gt;an endurance athlete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marley riding Unbound, even before her medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Marley Blonsky)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;It quickly became evident that the appetite suppression part of the drug worked a little too well, especially as an endurance cyclist who continued to train and ride throughout this experience. My body, that I had learned to listen to closely over the years, was suddenly not sending the same signals. I wasn’t hungry at all. While that’s often seen as a benefit, it’s actually the opposite of what an endurance athlete needs. You need calories to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Instead of being able to eat intuitively and trust that I was meeting my daily needs, I found myself having to set reminders to eat, planning each meal for maximum nutritional density.

This has mostly kept me from bonking while riding but it definitely isn’t fool proof. I also found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549"&gt;liquid calories&lt;/a&gt;, small frequent snacks and protein-dense meals helped ensure I was fueling my body properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As the months went on, I started to notice small changes in both my body and my riding. Clothes felt a little looser. I could see my collarbone for the first time in my life. My chronic joint pain and inflammation receded, and my period started becoming normal and lighter. Perhaps most excitingly, I was able to climb hills that I had previously walked up. I felt stronger on my bike and noticed I was consistently hitting PRs on segments I rode all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;My first public appearance in a noticeably smaller body was at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt"&gt;Mid South 2024&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, I had lost nearly 20% of my starting body weight. An acquaintance remarked that I looked “faster” than ever, and a social media follower commented “You’re getting skinny girl!” While I think these comments were intended to be positive, I was a little surprised. I’ve always been adamant that we shouldn’t comment on anyone’s body, regardless of size, and have publicly asked people not to comment on my body. My weight loss was not intentional, and I had no desire to promote it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Navigating the social and personal ramifications of a visibly changing body is intense. I was once again reminded how poorly society treats fat people. Whereas before I was mostly invisible, I now get unsolicited cat-calling from men, people are way nicer, and my concerns are taken seriously at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;After a complication with my prescribing doctor and insurance, I have been off the medication since May 2025. My last dose was two weeks before Unbound Gravel, where I successfully rode 109 miles (and had to relearn all my eating strategies on the fly, as I was suddenly &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hungry!) Sadly, my joint pain and inflammation have come roaring back into my life, along with my appetite. And so my health struggles continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I hesitate to share this story as a leader in the body positive world. Other leaders have been vilified for losing weight (see Lizzo) and changing their bodies. As I’ve gone through this process, it’s only reinforced my belief that all bodies are good bodies, all bikes are good bikes, and all rides should be celebrated. Regardless of my weight or size, my values, my personality, and my love of cycling are the same. Whether I wear a size 22 or a size 14, I still believe that everyone should get to experience the joy of cycling, with equipment, clothing, and a community that supports them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I also believe you should do whatever feels right for you to live happily, healthily, and pain-free, and it’s truly no one’s business but yours and your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned through this journey, it’s that health is not one-size-fits-all, and it’s never just about the number on the scale. The decisions we make about our bodies, our medical care, and our well-being are deeply personal, and often far more complex than they appear from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I didn’t take a GLP-1 to become thin or fit into a narrower mold of what an athlete looks like: hell, I’m still considered “obese” by all measures. I did it to manage chronic pain, stay active and keep riding bikes. My story isn’t a prescription or a path for anyone else; it’s simply a reminder that we all deserve access to tools that help us feel good in our bodies, no matter what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re an elite athlete, be aware that semaglutide is currently on the WADA Monitoring Program. This means that while drugs like Ozempic are not currently banned by WADA, the agency is monitoring its use in sports to determine if it should be added to the Prohibited List in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when the pediatrician walked in, the mood changed. “Praying?” she asked, her voice tight. The nurse and I stepped back while the pediatrician gently moved Maggie’s limbs, testing how much they could straighten or bend. While some tightness in the hips or knees can be normal for a newborn, Maggie’s joints were unusually tight and her limbs could not straighten all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pediatrician pointed out the rounded soles of Maggie’s feet. “A handful of genetic conditions can cause the shape of her feet. Most of them are fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"science/genetics","type":"Keyword","title":"Genetics"},{"id":"society/children","type":"Keyword","title":"Children"},{"id":"media/social-media","type":"Keyword","title":"Social media"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/21/daughter-health-mystery-rare-genetic-disorder","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I stared at her, unable to process the word “fatal” in connection to the brand new, six-pound person I’d brought into this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next seven days, I rarely slept. The children’s hospital put me up in a &lt;a href="https://rmhc.org/donate?c_src=paid&amp;amp;c_src2=25AORPMsearch_google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=skag&amp;amp;utm_medium=google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=18137358842&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRPtoQgoC6CZiFvnOViCEW5k9lpb&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3rnCBhBxEiwArN0QE9vNBl_qDYtTcGtcMgbBGoJllSmAiQTsnAcPX-fhBn2Civ-A3qUhPRoCbfIQAvD_BwE" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ronald McDonald house&lt;/a&gt; a mile away from the NICU, where Maggie had been transferred. Every three hours, I walked to the NICU to breastfeed and pump. I was anxious and scared, signing off on procedures and tests, and answering dozens of questions about my pregnancy, diet, lifestyle and family history. By the time Maggie left the hospital, she had been seen by neurology, genetics, internal medicine and orthopedics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then the results came: she had tested negative for the scary fatal conditions. The relief floored me. But she also tested negative for every other known diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Why are her joints stiff?” I asked her last doctor right before discharge. He shrugged and said, “We can only get to know her as an individual. Sometimes it is not a bad thing to see how unique each person really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I agreed that accepting my daughter’s differences was essential. But I worried that the physicians had missed something. For the next two months, I sat in front of the computer, flipping through Maggie’s 50-page medical chart and searching terms like “multiple joint contractures”, “vertical talus”, “high arched palate” and “micrognathia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eventually, I discovered pictures of children with similar limbs in medical journals and studies about arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC – an umbrella diagnosis describing infants born with multiple contracted joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I showed Maggie’s new pediatrician screenshots. The condition was incredibly rare, he said; in his 30-year career, he had met only three babies who looked like my daughter, all during his time as a military physician overseas. He referred us to the closest specialty clinic, which was five states away in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“She has a community. You just haven’t met them yet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I knew the trip would be daunting with an infant and Maggie’s two-year-old sibling in tow. But for the first time, I had some answers and knew where to look for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Six months later, Maggie and I arrived for her first appointment at the clinic. We saw five specialists, which took nine hours. Some mysteries were solved. I learned the term for her feet: “&lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Congenital_Vertical_Talus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rocker bottom&lt;/a&gt;”, the soles curving like the bottoms of cartoon boats. Surgery could guide them to grow flatter and arched, so she could learn to bear weight and eventually walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since birth, Maggie’s elbows had loosened, but her knees still didn’t flex all the way. We would need to take annual weeks-long trips to Philadelphia so the doctors could slowly stretch Maggie’s ankles and knees, wrap them in casts, saw off the casts a week later, stretch a little farther, and cast again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, we had no diagnosis. “What caused all this?” I asked the doctors. I was afraid to voice my other questions: &lt;em&gt;Will she walk or talk? How different will she be from her sibling? What decisions will I have to make? How will I know what is right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the United States, parents of the one in six children &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/child-development/about/developmental-disability-basics.html#:~:text=1%20in%206%2C%20or%20about%2017%25%2C%20of%20children%20aged%203%20through%2017" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;with developmental delays&lt;/a&gt; ask such questions every day. For the approximately&lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104235#:~:text=about%2030%20million%20people%E2%80%94half%20of%20them%20children" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 million children&lt;/a&gt; who have received a rare diagnosis, defined as one that affects &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/rare-diseases-fda#:~:text=on%20rare%20diseases?-,What%20is%20a%20rare%20disease?,drugs%20to%20treat%20rare%20diseases." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fewer than 200,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, the future is unknowable. Some diagnoses, like Maggie’s, are so rare that &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/rare-and-orphan-diseases" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they aren’t seen as profitable subjects&lt;/a&gt; for research funding. People with these “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1502161" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;orphan conditions&lt;/a&gt;” have to rely on themselves, their families, and grassroots endeavors to fund and discover treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating the maze of anxiety and “what ifs” felt relentless. Then I joined a Facebook group dedicated to the AMC specialist clinic we had visited, where parents shared pictures of their children, diagnoses, concerns, treatments and contact information for specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I introduced myself and posted pictures of Maggie. Immediately, Alyssa Wolfe, a mother and nurse, messaged me. She pointed out that her daughter, Delaney, had the same rocker bottom feet as Maggie, a rarity in the group. Our daughters both had one middle finger stuck flexed at the joint, and similar faces: a small chin, and a broad nose bridge that makes their eyes look farther apart than most babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4da723dd-340a-42ea-b464-5fbfd3c43211" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Maggie with her iPad, loaded with a program that she could use to talk.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Asha Dore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Delaney was three years older than Maggie. For years, I tracked Alyssa and Delaney’s progress through treatments, surgeries and diagnoses. Having another parent to talk to about major decisions was a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen Donohoe, a physical therapist, was also in the group, as she worked with many children with arthrogryposis. She had been gathering stories from patients like Maggie and Delaney because they “were different from the others with AMC, but they had so many of the same characteristics, it was impossible to ignore”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa had met Maureen at an arthrogryposis conference before I joined the group. “In an elevator, Maureen approached me, listing off Delaney’s attributes. I asked her if she somehow read my child’s medical chart. Maureen told me, ‘No,’ but she had been hypothesizing with a geneticist about a syndrome, and she thought Delaney had it,” Alyssa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After coming across six patients with these characteristics, Maureen had told Dr Judith Hall, a clinical geneticist and pediatrician, this might be a genetic anomaly worth studying. “After Dr Hall looked at her own notes, she called me and said, ‘I have 10,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Connecting with Alyssa and Maureen was the first major step in identifying Maggie’s condition. But what was the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As Maggie grew, her development continued to be markedly different from that of other kids her age. By the time she was three, she could scoot but not yet crawl. Most kids her age with AMC had been mobile for at least a year. But one day, in physical therapy, she suddenly stood with the help of a toy shopping cart. Then she learned to use a walker. Over the years Maureen noticed a similar trend with kids like Maggie. “They do their best weight-bearing and walking around preschool age,” she said. “When they get older, they seem to have a harder time maintaining a center of gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maggie was talking constantly, but her sounds were disorganized. Nobody could understand her. Most children with AMC alone had no speech problems at all. It was hard to find resources, but our speech therapist helped us get an iPad program that Maggie could use to talk. She’d press a button on a grid of images and common words, and the iPad would say the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her first sentence blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie was sitting at the dining room table eating breakfast while I washed dishes. “I need money,” her talker said in a mechanized child’s voice. I paused, holding a bowl. Maggie pressed the “talk” button again, and the sentence repeated. She pointed at my purse and threw her head back, guffawing. She’d made a joke. I said, “You need money!” over and over, laughing, nearly sobbing, dripping soapy water everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, Maggie was using her talker to ask for snacks and toys, to complain, to tell her new baby brother, “You’re cute!” At school, Maggie verbally repeated every word she or her friends pressed. By the end of the school year, the talker was gathering dust in our coat closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie’s limitations and sudden moments of progress surprised even the doctors who specialized in arthrogryposis. At every turn, I wanted to celebrate her success, but the gap widened between her and the other kids with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Isolating a genetic anomaly is a “diagnostic odyssey” that many families embark on, said Dr Michael Bamshad, head of genetic medicine in pediatrics at the University of Washington. “There’s all this data that sits locked away in medical records. A physician in one state may know of three similar cases, a physician in another state may know about five,” said Bamshad, “but there aren’t many ways for those families to find each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bamshad, his colleague Jessica X Chong and their colleagues have researched &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656649/#:~:text=Methods:%20Social%20networking%20among%20families%2C%20clinicians%2C%20and,conditions%2C%20particularly%20those%20with%20nonspecific%20phenotypic%20features." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the power of social media in genetic discovery&lt;/a&gt;. They launched a secure, free genetic information sharing site, &lt;a href="https://mygene2.org/MyGene2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MyGene2&lt;/a&gt;, in 2016. “Families and clinicians can share their genetic information to help them find answers,” said Chong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa and I input our daughters’ data and hoped for more information. But the waiting game was long, and we felt powerless. Alyssa recently described it to me as a three-part process: “In the beginning, parents are typically very active on social media, trying to understand their kid and hoping to give them as normal of a life as possible,” she said. Then, “sometime in elementary or middle school, their development stalls” and the focus shifts from “fixing” the issue to maintenance through puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can all be “very isolating”, she said. “Parents with typically developing kids often stop hanging out with you.” But “an acceptance stage” can come via social media groups like ours, which are “sometimes the only place to find connection and friends who understand”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2017, Catherine Paul-Fijten, a mother and molecular biologist who lives in Dubai, used Facebook groups to connect with parents whose kids resembled her daughter, Milou. I didn’t know about Milou yet, but she had the same physical traits as Maggie, who was five by then. Milou’s doctors had located a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;difference&lt;/a&gt; on the ZC4H2 gene shortly after birth, and Catherine organized a meeting of doctors and geneticists – including Maureen and Dr Bamshad – to review the current, albeit limited, research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen sat next to Bamshad, scrolling through pictures of Maggie, Delaney and other children with rocker bottom feet and tiny chins. Bamshad suggested that we both report our daughter’s symptoms on MyGene2 and apply for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, the diagnosis was confirmed: Maggie also had an anomaly of the ZC4H2 gene. At the time, fewer than 50 people with a similar genetic difference had ever been identified. Catherine used personal resources to start a foundation to research the impacts of this new genetic diagnosis, updating a new, dedicated Facebook group regularly with insights. The diagnosis gave us a sense of belonging through the shared goal of understanding our kids and learning how to help them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dramatic impact of online support groups for children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470259/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5350458/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; for more than 20 years. Online information sharing among parents has been found to strengthen treatment and mental health support &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998788/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316198/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;families &lt;/a&gt;and children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15658796/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721213001092?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; rare &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt; as well as more common diagnoses like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647109/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jpedres.org/articles/how-parents-of-children-with-cancer-seek-information-through-online-communities-a-netnography-study/doi/jpr.galenos.2019.48378?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the ZC4H2 gene difference is rare, research into rare conditions is crucial – “not just for the people who have that diagnosis – but for humanity as a whole”, Catherine said. That’s because “much of what we know about the function of the human genome comes from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases”, said Bamshad, citing examples including common heart conditions and vaccine research. “What we’ve learned about rare diseases helps us understand the genetic and molecular basis of common conditions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ZC4H2 group has nearly 200 members, though nearly 250 people with this condition have now been identified globally. Because of their stories, I was prepared. In 2023, at the beginning of sixth grade, Maggie suddenly presented with severe scoliosis, and I knew she would probably need a full spinal fusion because I’d heard about related complications from our ZC4H2 community. I shared this information with Maggie’s spinal surgeon, as well as a list of other surgeons who had had to manage these complications, and she formed a pre-emptive plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;During Maggie’s spinal surgery, I let myself get lost in the labyrinthian halls of the hospital for hours, cellphone in one hand, operating room pager in the other. As with her previous 10-plus surgeries, I didn’t allow myself to imagine what was happening or what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As I stood in the hallway, I scrolled through encouraging comments and messages from Alyssa, Catherine and others. Despite our different jobs, family culture and background, we’d collaborated with doctors, scientists, physical and speech therapists – and each other – for more than a decade. Their support didn’t guarantee a perfect future for my daughter, but their generosity was a profound gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The operating room pager went off. My phone rang. The charge nurse told me my daughter was waking up, that surgery had been a breeze. I rushed to the recovery room, tapping the app to share the news while I waited for Maggie to be wheeled in. At the top of the feed, a new member had posted about her child’s fresh diagnosis, her questions, her fears. I abandoned my own update to type the words that changed the course of my life and Maggie’s childhood: &lt;em&gt;Welcome! You are not alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQX1ZXR3RjS1M5b25oWkd0QW85QldnblBXVmZsQlB2S2FFbkREazl6d3luc3Yya0wwRlYwbmpMRWZKZG5oTnNWelFwTmFqN2JaREptMGNIS2t3SXdHMjFidmk0V1dTMjhGRkFUMEJkbjhCeU9yeHN0U05reU9CYkJyYjVFM1VxYUNYenBxMEt4T3QwSjNoTUpZNUln</guid></item><item><title>在主要新研究中发现的四种生物学上不同的自闭症类型- Earth.com | Four biologically distinct types of autism discovered in major new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder has long challenged both science and medicine. Each type presents differently – from speech delays to social difficulties to repetitive behaviors – making it hard to define and diagnose in a clear, unified way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, clinicians, and researchers have often worked with uncertainty, relying on broad categories that mask the condition’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;complexity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simons Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have reshaped our understanding of autism. They identified four distinct clinical and biological subtypes using data from over 5,000 children in the SPARK autism cohort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift toward a person-centered view may change how autism is diagnosed and treated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-types-mapped-with-big-data"&gt;Autism types mapped with big data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of linking individual traits to single genes, the team used a computational model that considered each child’s entire profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed over 230 traits per child – spanning developmental milestones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddler-screen-time-linked-to-atypical-sensory-behaviors/"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; challenges, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed them to group individuals into categories that reflect meaningful differences in both behavior and biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of autism is essential for revealing the biological mechanisms that contribute to the condition, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis,” said Olga Troyanskaya, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-four-distinct-autism-types-emerge"&gt;Four distinct autism types emerge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined four categories of autism. The Social and Behavioral Challenges group includes children with classic autism traits but typical developmental progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group features children who reach milestones later but often lack anxiety or disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moderate Challenges group has milder autism traits, no delays, and few psychiatric &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-brain-learns-study-reveals-an-unexpected-twist/"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;. The Broadly Affected group shows a wide range of severe symptoms including delays, repetitive behaviors, and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology,” said Aviya Litman, Ph.D. student at Princeton and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-clues-behind-autism-types"&gt;Genetic clues behind autism types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional genetic testing explains only a small portion of autism cases. This study went further by revealing distinct genetic profiles for each subtype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broadly Affected group showed the highest rate of damaging mutations not inherited from parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group had more rare inherited variants. Though the two groups share some traits, their genetic origins differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While genetic testing is already part of the standard of care for people diagnosed with autism, thus far, this testing reveals variants that explain the autism of only about 20% of patients,” said Jennifer Foss-Feig of the Simons Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study begins to bridge that gap by offering a clearer map of which variants relate to which traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings point to specific hypotheses linking various pathways to different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; of autism,” said Litman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developmental-timing-matters"&gt;Developmental timing matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic influences behind each subtype do not act at the same time in development. In children with social and behavioral challenges, key gene mutations become active after birth. This matches the clinical picture of late diagnosis without early developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, children in the Mixed ASD group carry mutations that affect the brain during fetal development. These genetic timelines correspond to the children’s milestones, diagnoses, and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating genetic and clinical data at scale, we can now begin to map the trajectory of autism,” said Chandra Theesfeld of Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-direction-for-autism-research"&gt;New direction for autism research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification of autism types builds on years of collaborative research and was made possible through integration across genetics, psychology, and computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Princeton Precision Health’s mission to connect biological insight with clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a whole new paradigm, to provide these groups as a starting point for investigating the genetics of autism,” said Theesfeld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of searching for one common cause of autism, researchers can now examine the distinct mechanisms behind each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Sauerwald, co-lead author, explained, “The ability to define biologically meaningful autism subtypes is foundational to realizing the vision of precision medicine for neurodevelopmental conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-families"&gt;What this means for families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this research may offer new clarity and direction. Knowing a child’s autism subtype could help with planning school support, medical care, and therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment, and tailored support and accommodations at school or work,” said Foss-Feig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families may gain insight into what symptoms to expect and how to better plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-model-can-work-for-other-issues"&gt;Autism model can work for other issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on autism, its methods may apply to other complex conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining clinical traits with genetic data, researchers can now identify clear subtypes where once there was only disorder-level confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to countless new scientific and clinical discoveries,” said Theesfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:22:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ</guid></item><item><title>第二次世界大战产生的原子废料的小溪与癌症风险增加有关- NPR | A creek with atomic waste from WWII is linked to increased cancer risk - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxNMGhMVFEwZnY1ZENfUW9FVTBTejUwUmFuTXVNOXYyd3hhMlh3b1NGSlUzRXVLZjktQkFTZE1UY1o2OU9CcTBtaURNWEZpbGZheGZ4NldEeVd0MkJXOXp6SFlWT0wyUEFnNkdLMlNnS1N3V0NyeWl4dzhqVFlkeEt6ZlRMUnIzOWFaLTlEc3ZFQWhSYkRHWkhmenlFQ2VnbnppT3pCN0RKbDliMEdRT0w3RjNELVFJQWYyX0NFLS1DQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., speaks in favor of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2024. The legislation, which will benefit people sickened by radiation exposure in uranium mining and nuclear weapons testing, was included in the budget bill President Trump signed on July 4, 2025.

   &lt;p&gt;Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836420" target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open, &lt;/em&gt;corroborate worries that &lt;a href="https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-04-01/st-louis-coldwater-creek-residents-federal-compensation" target="_blank"&gt;neighbors of Coldwater Creek&lt;/a&gt; have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek," said the study's senior author, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/marc-weisskopf/" target="_blank"&gt;Marc Weisskopf,&lt;/a&gt; an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of the Manhattan Project, &lt;a href="https://moenvironment.org/blog/brief-history-of-radioactivity-in-st-louis/" target="_blank"&gt;Mallinckrodt Chemical Works&lt;/a&gt; processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study's release comes shortly after passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" which contained a &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-passes-reca-secures-new-medicaid-funding-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/__;!!Iwwt!RpIk0hm2iuov0N-Cy-QCKvDHyND1ZkmXa57Pi4rgJ3Y-LTKdWcSVMAsVpL-a5cpxucqHkavllw61dklvBFU$" target="_blank"&gt;little-known provision&lt;/a&gt; to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3853/text#:~:text=%E2%80%9C(c)%20Payments%20to%20beneficiaries,shares%20to%20each%20surviving%20child." target="_blank"&gt;payments of $25,000&lt;/a&gt; to families of people who died as a result of &lt;a href="https://knpr.org/2025-07-09/radiation-exposure-compensation-act-is-renewed" target="_blank"&gt;radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area&lt;/a&gt; and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43956.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Radiation Exposure Compensation Act&lt;/a&gt;, known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78520" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Research treasure trove: Decades-old baby teeth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman,&lt;/a&gt; a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. "This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible," she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A behavioral difference for boys?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the &lt;a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/tooth-fairy-goes-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;baby teeth&lt;/a&gt; of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21319726/" target="_blank"&gt;A 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure," he said. "If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In anti-vaccine communities, it may quickly find a foothold and spread largely under the radar before ballooning into an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/texas","type":"Keyword","title":"Texas"},{"id":"society/mmr","type":"Keyword","title":"MMR"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/21/anti-vaxxer-measles-texas","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Brian Hooker, chief scientific officer of Children’s Health Defense, filmed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/measles-spread-vaccine-misinformation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas in March with the parents of the six-year-old child who died from measles – the first measles death in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The video promoted several dangerous myths about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, a virus that can be deadly and can cause lifelong harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker and Polly Tommey, an anti-vaccine film-maker with Children’s Health Defense, also interviewed other Mennonite families in west Texas. And they visited the medical office of Ben Edwards while patients and Edwards himself had symptomatic measles, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker then traveled home to Redding, California, and developed measles symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Full disclosure, 18 days after visiting Seminole, Texas, sitting in a measles clinic and being exposed to Doctor Ben with the measles, I got the measles. So cool,” Hooker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker, Tommey, and Edwards spoke on a &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6tml4t-episode-178-measles-outbreak-update.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch on May 22. This news has not been previously reported by other outlets. Children’s Health Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiry for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker doesn’t appear to have sought healthcare or testing to confirm his symptoms were measles and not another infection. Other viral and bacterial infections may cause rashes, which is why medical providers need to conduct tests to confirm measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without confirmation of his illness being measles, Hooker may spread misinformation about the illness – including what helps to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker says he turned to the alternative treatments hailed by anti-vaccine activists. Edwards had given him cod liver oil and vitamin C supplements in Gaines county, Hooker said, noting: “I stuck them in my luggage, and that’s what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if this case was measles, by not seeking confirmation testing and notifying officials, Hooker may have contributed to onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not clear if his first symptoms appeared after 18 days, or if he developed other symptoms – runny nose, cough, fever, watery eyes – and then a rash after 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After a person is exposed to measles, the virus usually incubates for 11 to 12 days before respiratory symptoms appear, followed by a rash two to four days later. A person is considered infectious four days before the rash appears and remains infectious until four days after it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If Hooker’s illness was measles, “it sounds like my worst nightmare as an infectious disease doc,” said Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at University of California San Francisco. “For all we know, there’s a trail of measles, like bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In areas with no known cases, health providers might not immediately suspect measles, he said: “Many people probably didn’t know they had it. There could have been people who were ill with pneumonia, who went into the hospital and no one diagnosed it. It’s very, very hard to diagnose because we haven’t seen that much of it. But of course, we’re seeing a lot more of it now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are other indications that the actual number of cases from the Texas outbreak is higher than the official count, Chin-Hong said – with three confirmed deaths, experts might expect a case count closer to 3,000, instead of the 762 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and 95 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, medical providers alert local or state health officials when a patient tests positive for measles. Health officials then conduct contact tracing to notify anyone who came into contact with the patient, including other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A representative for the Shasta county health department, serving the area where Hooker &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e-8918348/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he lives, said there have been no confirmed cases of measles reported this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are no cases of measles in Shasta county, and we have had no notice of any confirmed cases of measles this year,” said Jules Howard, community education specialist with the Shasta County Health &amp;amp; Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to know when a region has even a single case so resources can be diverted to the area to stop transmission, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most important part of those efforts is contact tracing and vaccinating anyone who is vulnerable – especially infants, pregnant people, and immune-compromised people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker is a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine community. He testified on Tuesday before a US Senate committee in its first-ever “vaccine injury” hearing, attempting to link MMR vaccination to autism – despite several studies showing no relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker said he became sick with measles despite being vaccinated as a child. But because he was born before 1989, he probably only received one dose of the MMR vaccine, which is 93% effective at stopping illness. Vaccination may also make breakthrough illness milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When anti-vaccine messages keep parents from getting their children vaccinated, “I think the damage is immediate,” Chin-Hong said, before adding that it “goes beyond the measles outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough and the flu are also surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is like the poster child, but it’s about a way of life that we’ve taken for granted in the last few decades that is threatened,” Chin-Hong said. “The fact that [they] are questioning it on a public stage means that a lot more people who might have trusted their clinicians are questioning it more now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US eliminated measles in 2000, but the nation could lose that status if there is sustained transmission for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re going back in time,” Chin-Hong said. “We have to relearn all of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UaXdVdmtRb3I4ZERCLXplcTJXMFNPZkVWd2IzSWxELXdjRVQyME8xM0tVbVZDclFJRUpQTHRPZGxRVFA4V05ycUhhR2xYYS1vVUtQQUZlRWhIVU1jRmdMZ2ZNbWNvVy1HeC12eGtpWXlHTVRMRXJ1bkM3Y1NtUQ</guid></item><item><title>抗癌药物能否成为阿尔茨海默氏症治疗的未来？ -雅虎主页 | Could cancer drugs be the future of Alzheimer's treatment? - Yahoo Home</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With few treatments available to stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have turned to cancer drugs as a potential means of walking back cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s cases are rising in the United States and worldwide due to an aging population, but there is no cure for the disease.

They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’ database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In &lt;span&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/span&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important. Letrozole can cause hot flashes and irinotecan can cause severe diarrhea. Both drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These drugs have huge side effects, so you need to always balance and figure out whether those types of side effects would be amenable to somebody with Alzheimer’s,” Sirota said. “It’s not that it’s a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-drugs-future-alzheimers-treatment-rcna219581" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw</guid></item><item><title>癌症药物能否成为阿尔茨海默氏症治疗的未来？ - NBC新闻 | Could cancer drugs be the future of Alzheimer’s treatment? - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRnp4enNZeHh1Rk5iNjJHVXd5OE8wQklNVk44S3Zwck41dXVnVVJoYXhnQ1V0d2xCRklhNUZSTFRwT1ZqQXNyaXN6T3ZCUW5HaGxCdXZYUW1jOUxIMUpYbUs4THRYTVhhYVBXUUN4bUxHNkVkbnRENGFRSkwxcS1VaVNTYlgxZThNc3ZCbHhabHV0NmxHQnhnQUJR0gFWQVVfeXFMUENMazRrb3BMM2NVS2pnTTFRS2daR3hyTnFmLTJRXzRPU1lRWDk3ZWZVLUpzeGFNdzJvclNsOUhvZUNGTG9oYzI5MWVqSDY3V3pFdGVodkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31ef08" class="body-graf"&gt;With few treatments available to stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have turned to cancer drugs as a potential means of walking back cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-83990c" class="body-graf"&gt;Alzheimer’s cases are rising in the United States and worldwide due to an aging population, but there is no cure for the disease.

These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5fb8e" class="body-graf"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e3b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed88b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd94e7" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://letrozole" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" target="_blank"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53b57b" class="body-graf"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9763dd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73ee98" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90acd4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f27e1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e31c" class="body-graf"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986e4" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ab613" class="body-graf"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-754b37" class="body-graf"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-671ed8" class="body-graf"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ea4a6" class="body-graf"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important. Letrozole can cause hot flashes and irinotecan can cause severe diarrhea. Both drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073381" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These drugs have huge side effects, so you need to always balance and figure out whether those types of side effects would be amenable to somebody with Alzheimer’s,” Sirota said. “It’s not that it’s a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRnp4enNZeHh1Rk5iNjJHVXd5OE8wQklNVk44S3Zwck41dXVnVVJoYXhnQ1V0d2xCRklhNUZSTFRwT1ZqQXNyaXN6T3ZCUW5HaGxCdXZYUW1jOUxIMUpYbUs4THRYTVhhYVBXUUN4bUxHNkVkbnRENGFRSkwxcS1VaVNTYlgxZThNc3ZCbHhabHV0NmxHQnhnQUJR0gFWQVVfeXFMUENMazRrb3BMM2NVS2pnTTFRS2daR3hyTnFmLTJRXzRPU1lRWDk3ZWZVLUpzeGFNdzJvclNsOUhvZUNGTG9oYzI5MWVqSDY3V3pFdGVodkE</guid></item><item><title>Tick Talk ：为什么德克萨斯州对莱姆病充满担忧- FMX 94.5 | Tick Talk: Why Texas Is Buzzing With Concerns About Lyme Disease - FMX 94.5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV0FVX3lxTE5Ka1hzeGVjVm1uVUVyaWVYTDRCUUIwTEVMXzBwNU4xRXpteEhXb0hQN1ZlRU90WWl0dlpicko1MDBGZ0FZTU5mNzllRkRHeDRpeERpNm9IVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pod-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas is usually known for its wide-open spaces and big, beautiful sunsets, but it's also becoming an unexpected hotspot for a much tinier, and more sinister problem- ticks. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; cases are being reported across the state at an alarming rate, prompting concern among health officials. From the backyard to hiking trails, Texans are being chomped on by ticks, and some of those bites and lead to very serious, sometimes even debilitating illness. Let's take a closer look at what's behind the surge in tick activity, and what we can do to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rise in Tick Activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keranews.org/health-wellness/2025-07-21/tick-activity-higher-in-texas-this-season-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;Dr. Michael Allen&lt;/a&gt; from UNT's Health Science Center says the influx of Lyme disease reports is due in part to the fact that Texas experiences a relatively wet spring and summer, with heat that wasn't quite as oppressive as is typical, which led to the survival of ticks from winter months through til summer. Contrary to popular belief, Lyme disease is a massive concern in the United States with roughly half a million cases reported each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-r6PynlurQ2M-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-small-black-insect-sitting-on-top-of-a-persons-finger-r6PynlurQ2M?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease: What To Know&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2825/"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; is caused when bacteria are transmitted from a deer tick, and may cause symptoms that affect the skin, nervous system, heart, and/or joints of a person. It can affect people of any age, but people who spend more time in grassy or wooded environments are especially at risk of exposure. Not every tick bite will give you Lyme disease, and in most cases, a tick must be attached 36 hours or more before it transmits bacteria to you. Lyme disease cannot be spread from person to person, and transference to the fetus of a pregnant woman is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read More: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://kfmx.com/ixp/190/p/lubbock-bee-swarm-response/?utm_source=tsmclip&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Bee Infestation Causes Stings In South Lubbock Neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-marino-linic-M_krTMIPSLg-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Marino Linic on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@marinolinic?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Marino Linic&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-holding-a-small-bug-M_krTMIPSLg?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 to 80 percent of Lyme disease cases begin with a solid patch rash, roughly 2 inches in diameter, that appears around or near the site of the bite. In some cases, there will be multiple rashes. Early signs of the disease include headache, fever/chills, stiff neck, swollen glands, and muscle/joint pain. If the disease goes untreated in the early stage, it can become much more severe. As Lyme disease progresses, untreated, it is characterized by severe fatigue, stiff aching neck, numbness and tingling sensations in the arms and legs, and even facial paralysis. Sometimes, this array of symptoms doesn't appear for weeks, months, or even years after the tick bite. It's important to seek medical treatment immediately if you think you may have contracted Lyme disease. With antibiotics, it's almost always fully curable. However, the chances to completely cure the disease will decrease if treatment is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-bHwrqIAwBF8-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-persons-skin-with-a-spider-on-it-bHwrqIAwBF8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks love moist areas that are shady and right around ground level. They cling to tall grass, shrubs, and bushes, waiting for a passing animal to drop onto. Once a tick reaches your skin, it typically climbs upward, looking for protected areas to latch onto. After you've spent time outdoors, be sure to check all of your most private areas for the little critters. They are very light and small, and often go unnoticed as they walk across your body. Wear light-colored clothing to easily spot them and consider tucking your pants into your socks or boots when you're out in thick grass and brush. Use insect repellent and avoid sitting directly on the ground or stone walls, and keep your hair pulled back, especially when doing things like gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep scrolling for more Texas-based news in the galleries below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Deadly Texas: The Lone Star State's Most Dangerous Insects &amp;amp; Arachnids &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encounters with Texas insects can be magical (think flights of Monarch butterflies!), but mostly they tend to be neutral or negative.

Fibroblasts (the skin cells that make collagen) become less active and collagen production becomes less efficient. This process typically begins in your thirties, varies by ethnicity, and speeds up by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="menopause" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And that's not all: On top of the natural degradation of this essential building block, the onslaught of daily life and certain lifestyle habits also take their toll. “Collagen is constantly being broken down by sun exposure, environmental stressors, and enzymes within the body,” says Dr. Shah. Free radicals, unstable molecules generated by UV radiation and pollution attack and degrade the protein. And certain lifestyle factors aren't helping matters: smoking and a high-sugar diet can all affect our stores of collagen. “Less obvious contributors include chronic stress, poor sleep, and environmental pollution,” Dr. Shah adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The result: a gradual loss of skin structure, leading to wrinkles, rough texture, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="enlarged pores" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;enlarged pores&lt;/a&gt;, crepey skin, and increased fragility, often experienced as easy bruising, says Dr. Shah. The early signs of collagen loss often show around &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the eyes" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;the eyes&lt;/a&gt;, mouth (even in non-smokers), and forehead—typically areas where there’s a lot of expression from facial movement. By our forties and fifties, “fine lines deepen due to continued collagen and elastin loss and compounded by a loss of bone and fat in the cheeks and jawline, causing sagging around the jowls and neck,” says Dr. Kseniya Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Basically, when collagen dips, your features look a less snatched.&lt;br data-node-id="13.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="happily-there-is-skincare-that-can-help" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Happily, there is skincare that can help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now, some good news: you &lt;em data-node-id="15.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; protect what you have. “The most effective approach involves minimizing collagen breakdown by maintaining a nutrient-rich diet, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wearing SPF 30" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;wearing SPF 30&lt;/a&gt; or higher daily, and incorporating proven ingredients such as retinoids, antioxidants, and peptides into your skincare routine,” Dr. Kobets says.

First, start with lighter serums like vitamin C, then apply heavier creams or oils. Retinoids should be used at night and introduced gradually. “I like to layer vitamin C in the morning followed by sunscreen, and retinoids in the evening,” says Dr. Libby. “Peptides and moisturizers like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;/a&gt; can be layered with both for additional hydration and repair.” &lt;br data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-your-dermatologist-can-help" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;How your dermatologist can help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In-office treatments can help stimulate collagen production through controlled injury or thermal energy, which activates the body's own wound healing response, stimulating fibroblasts to churn out more collagen. “As your skin heals from these minor injuries, the resulting collagen fills in wrinkles, scars, and enlarged pores, improving skin texture and firmness,” says Dr. Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The right treatment depends on a patient’s skin concerns, age, and skin condition, says Dr. Libby. “Younger patients in their 20s and 30s may be advised to focus on prevention and early maintenance with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chemical peels" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chemical peels&lt;/a&gt; and lighter &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="laser skin tightening" data-node-id="31.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;laser skin tightening&lt;/a&gt;. While patients in their forties and beyond may benefit from more corrective treatments like ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and radiofrequency to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Here's what our experts recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Chemical Peels:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-depth chemical peels (like Jessner’s) use a blend of acids to remove the outermost layers of skin. They work primarily on the skin’s surface, but can also stimulate collagen remodeling below. These are most suitable for younger patients with minimal collagen loss, says Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Laser Resurfacing:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients in their forties and beyond may benefit more from ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers. “These treatments partially ablate and heat the skin to trigger collagen repair and remodeling,” says Dr. Kobets. Examples include C02 lasers (ablative) and Fraxel (non-ablative), and Halo (both). “Ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and RF therapy to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” adds Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; “Microneedling mechanically penetrates the dermis to stimulate collagen formation,” Dr. Kobets says. “It can be enhanced by combining it with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which reduces downtime and further boosts collagen synthesis.” Derived from your own blood, PRP contains growth factors that can speed both healing and results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Radiofrequency Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; These cutting-edge treatments like the famoust Morpheus8 intensifies the traditional microneedling with heat-based energy.  “It promotes deeper collagen remodeling through both physical injury and heat,” Dr. Kobets says, making it especially effective for skin tightening and deeper wrinkles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Ultrasound Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.1"&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;: For a non-invasive option, devices like Sofwave rely on focused heat to stimulate collagen deep below the surface. “This heat breaks down old collagen and signals the body to produce fresh collagen while clearing out the damaged matrix. The result is firmer, tighter skin over several weeks,” says Dr. Kobets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.5.0"&gt;Biostimular Fillers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Injectible fillers" data-node-id="33.5.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Injectible fillers&lt;/a&gt; can stimulate collagen production over time. “ Sculptra and Radiesse are the probably the best ways to build collagen locally,” says Dr. Lal.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-build-collagen-through-diet" data-node-id="34" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;Can you build collagen through diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Eating collagen doesn’t rebuild collagen, so you can’t exactly replace what’s been lost in your face through your diet. But you &lt;em data-node-id="35.1"&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;support your skin with what you eat. One essential nutrient to overall skin health, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to research" data-node-id="35.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;, is vitamin C, “which helps your body build strong collagen by activating enzymes that stabilize and form it,” says Dr.  Kobets. “Without enough of this vitamin, collagen formation is impaired—scurvy is a good example of this.” Citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens are all excellent sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While collagen-rich foods like bone broth and gelatin are often praised, they’re not broken down in a way that specifically targets the skin. “Because these proteins are distributed throughout the body once digested, they don’t necessarily reach the skin directly,” she adds. Also watch the sugar, which can cause a collagen-damaging process known as glycation. “Glycation is essentially when sugar interacts with collagen, creating a modified form of collagen called advanced glycation end products or AGEs, which are stiffer, less pliable, and break down faster than healthy collagen,” says Dr. Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-collagen-creams-and-supplements" data-node-id="37" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;What about collagen creams and supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Much has been said about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oral collagen supplements" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;oral collagen supplements&lt;/a&gt; to help improve the appearance of your skin. So what does the science say? They can help, but “not all collagens are alike,” says Dr. Lal. “Verisol collagen supplementation has been shown to improve skin quality which often translates to reducing collagen breakdown.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, one study of more than 100 women ranging in age from 45-65 years old found that taking a Verisol collagen supplement experienced a statistically significant increase in collagen and elastin in skin that resulted in a significant reduction in eye wrinkle volume.

But are you really expected to go full days without eating &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its name suggests completely going without food every other day, studies on ADF typically involve eating about 25 percent of your usual intake one day, followed by a “feast day” of eating as much food as you like. The daily see-saw approach is still restrictive, yet for some, there’s appeal to a diet that doesn’t tell you what you can and can’t eat, doesn’t require macro tracking, and doesn’t say “kitchen’s closed” at any particular hour of the day. The only thing you need to track with alternate-day fasting is your calories: You simply cut them down to 25 percent of your normal intake every other day, then eat how you like on opposite days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not right for everyone, but if you’re wondering whether or not ADF lives up to its reputation for weight loss and other health perks, we’ve gathered the research and asked the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and metabolism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most touted benefits of ADF is its impact on metabolism. According to weight-loss dietitian and nutrition writer Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, ADF’s influence on metabolism is not unlike that of a keto diet. “Alternate-day fasting can support metabolic health by giving the body time to enter ketosis,” she says. “This is a process where your body starts to use fat as its primary energy source, rather than carbohydrates, and typically starts after at least 18 hours of fasting.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224025161" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that ketosis may help preserve muscle mass, which in turn can support a more active metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic boost ADF may give is no small feat for body composition. A&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049520302006" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 systematic review and meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who followed this eating pattern for six months had reduced body mass index (BMI), body weight, and total cholesterol. That’s a pretty impressive combo for metabolic health—and one of the more promising alternate-day fasting benefits supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of ADF for metabolism don’t stop there. “It may also be beneficial for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7138754/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest ADF can reduce fasting insulin levels more than daily calorie restriction, though results are still mixed and may depend on the individual,” Mitri says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored ADF’s effect on heart disease risk markers, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, Mitri points out. “However, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are mixed on this, and more recent research suggests ADF does not have any positive impact on heart disease,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every research study has shown dramatic results for metabolism, either. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that people who tried ADF didn’t experience more weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic measures than those who restricted calories every day, or even those who had no dietary intervention at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shocker here: Burning fat and preserving muscle could lead to weight loss. Though studies have had varying results, some show that the back-and-forth of alternate-day fasting is more than the sum of its caloric parts. “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.586036/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows people following ADF can lose 3-7% of their body weight in 8-12 weeks, along with reductions in body fat, waist circumference, and visceral fat,” says Amy Davis, M.S., R.D. These are some of the most sought-after alternate-day fasting benefits, especially for those with weight-related health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled with diets that pigeonhole your eating into narrow food categories or time windows, Davis says alternate-day fasting can be a smart choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who might benefit most include people who struggle with moderation, those who don’t like tracking food or macros, people who like large meals and find portion control difficult, and individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nadiia Borovenko / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want to live longer? Some research shows that ADF could promote longevity, though Davis cautions that many studies have been conducted on animals, and more research is needed. Three processes that could help explain why alternate-day fasting may support longevity are autophagy, metabolic switching, and enhanced cellular function. “Autophagy is the process of cellular repair that can enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative damage,” Davis explains. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509423/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that fasting triggers these helpful activities known for extending lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic switching, on the other hand, is the cycling between feasting and fasting that’s the hallmark of ADF. “Fasting periods deplete glycogen and trigger fat oxidation, which boosts metabolic flexibility,” Davis says. Some researchers believe a flexible metabolism may play a role in supporting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, supporting cellular health and metabolic efficiency is often considered beneficial for longevity. A fasting-based eating plan has been studied for its potential to influence markers associated with aging and metabolic function, though it’s not currently recommended as a treatment for any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important not to offset the potential benefits of fasting with the food you eat on your “off” days. “While ‘feast day’ may sound like a free-for-all, the quality of the foods consumed on those days matters, especially for longevity,” Davis says. “Certain foods have been linked to longevity, including fiber-rich plant-based options like vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts.” On the other hand, a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been associated with negative health outcomes, including markers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538973/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied to a shorter lifespan.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied to a shorter lifespan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sasithorn Phuapankasemsuk / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who shouldn’t try alternate-day fasting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any diet, ADF isn’t right for everyone. “Certain individuals should avoid alternate-day fasting,” says Davis. Those with a history of eating disorders should steer clear, she says, since the restrictive nature of fasting can be a trigger. “Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and teens should also avoid ADF, since they need consistent nutrition to support growth and development.” Lastly, those taking insulin or other diabetes meds should avoid fasting to prevent hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re OK flexing your willpower muscles, alternate-day fasting could be your sweet spot for a trimmer figure, higher metabolism, longer life, and more. Just be sure to check in with your healthcare provider before starting a new diet, especially one that involves fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT OUR EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., is a weight-loss dietitian, nutrition writer, and owner of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melissa Mitri Nutrition.

Arevalo, a New York-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating them alone makes it even worse," she cautioned. "When eating them together with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, we are cushioning their effect by slowing their absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that eating protein before refined carbs promotes the secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the gut, which delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat other foods first — mainly fiber-rich foods — and then you &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink water&lt;/a&gt;, the fiber from the foods helps you feel satisfied, thus decreasing your appetite," Arevalo told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And let’s not forget that fiber also helps to reduce the absorption of sugar in the blood, helping to cushion your sugar levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex carbohydrates — such as most vegetables, beans and legumes — are rich in fiber and slow to digest, which causes a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates — such as sugar, white rice and white flour — have higher glycemic levels, which are easier to break down and contribute to faster blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrition experts pointed out, eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;during digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower during digestion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assist with healthier food choices and to monitor blood sugar levels after a meal, experts recommend using a food rating system called the glycemic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rating scale determines how quickly certain foods can cause blood sugars to rise and fall, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, Susie laid out the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with eating non-starchy vegetables first, as the fiber slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat protein and healthy fats.

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000u3b6n05mudj93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000z3b6nd2j0kcik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200133b6n72j4frno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200143b6nrrqr11fi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200153b6nhnt9pxw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200163b6n8m32g530@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000j3b6nark07ipt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000k3b6nl555o66e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.

            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Out-of-Touch Adult’s Guide to Kid Culture, where you have joined my new religious group, just by reading these words. This week, we're taking a look at an online cult that got a little too real, asking why young people are branding themselves with liquid nitrogen, and discussing the generational stare-down being enacted across the counters of retail establishments all over the country. Plus a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; viral video about the dangers of jumbotrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-children-of-the-waning-star-an-online-cult"&gt;Is Children of the Waning Star an online cult? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your child says they've joined a cult called "Children of the Waning Star," it's not as bad as it seems.  The online group began on July 11, when TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Gigi Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; announced she was starting a cult, "and you're all going to be a part of it." It was obviously a joke, but the video took off on the platform, earning millions of views, and before long, the cult began picking up steam. Jarvis and her followers chose the name "Children of the Waning Star," picked some special cult symbols, and declared new holidays. Jarvis even added "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/video/7526461163597499662" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;cult leader&lt;/a&gt;" to her resume. But then the blowback started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commenters informed Jarvis that cults are &lt;em&gt;not something you should joke about.&lt;/em&gt; Others, like this "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;pagan witch,&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@char.char_slide/video/7527026025599864078" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;posted videos&lt;/a&gt; about how the Waning Star was "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;spiraling out of control&lt;/a&gt;" or &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;becoming a real cult.&lt;/a&gt; So Jarvis, less than a week after she started her group, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/photo/7528239581473393933" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;announced she was shutting&lt;/a&gt; down the project. A week from cult to apology might be the world record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand why stopped, but I think it's a shame. Jarvis clearly wasn't trying to be a cult leader for &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, and Children of the Waning Star isn't the first (or the 10,000th) parody religion ever created. There's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Church of the Subgenius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Pastafarians&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism?ref=highexistence.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Discordian Society,&lt;/a&gt; and many more. None of these "spiraled out of control" or become "real" cults, even though they've been around for decades. Instead, they serve a real purpose by giving people a way to think and talk about unusual belief systems, and maybe provide tools to recognize the methods of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; authoritarian groups so they can be avoided.  Also: I really liked that Waning Star chose everything democratically. It would have been interesting to see the TikTok collective define and codify its spiritual beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-freeze-branding"&gt;What is "freeze branding"?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_brand" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Freeze branding,&lt;/a&gt; or cryo branding, is a method of using cryogenic materials, usually liquid nitrogen, to mark livestock. It's thought to be less painful and damaging than branding with heat. It was first practiced in 1960s, and it took all the way until 2021 for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8166665/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;a case of human freeze branding to be recorded in medical literature&lt;/a&gt;. The procedure has been gaining enough traction among body modification fans online lately for doctors to&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt; issue stern warnings against the practice&lt;/a&gt;. Although it doesn't seem that widespread. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are not a horse," dermatologist Dr. Andrea Suarez (known online as &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Dray&lt;/a&gt;) reminds us &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;in this TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, "This can result in a full thickness burn that puts you at risk for a deep infection called cellulitis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7494792376762862890"&gt;
    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dray sure is a &lt;em&gt;downer&lt;/em&gt;, but I assume she's right, and that no one should ever brand themself with liquid nitrogen because it's super, super bad—but I get why people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. The effect on cattle is cool: Freeze branding (animals) destroys pigmentation in hair follicles, resulting in white hair and/or white skin in the shape of the brand. There isn't much serious discussion online about how/if it's possible to cold brand people safely, but this video from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aD8w9_1VXzs" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;another online doctor&lt;/a&gt; reveals that doctors use liquid nitrogen regularly, so it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to cold brand people without disastrous consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-gen-z-stare"&gt;What is the "Gen-Z Stare?"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "Gen Z stare" is popping up all over &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/genzstare" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/what-is-the-gen-z-stare-all-about-the-latest-term-dividing-the-internet-11772963" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;non&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/gen-z-stare-latest-tiktok-170034069.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/07/17/gen-z-stare/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. It refers to the blank expression that is supposedly common among people between the ages of 13 and 28 years old, noticed especially often among &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6YXLBjW/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retail workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gen Z, it is said, responds to boiler-plate greetings and small talk with an inscrutable stare instead of a smile or nod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not a new term—&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghan.alessi/video/7397202641966746911" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this video explaining the phenomena is nearly a year old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;— it has gone &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; viral lately. Is this a real shift in cultural behavior, or a trendy age-based online carping campaign? It's hard to say when it comes to something as amorphous as people online reporting, "the barista looks at me funny when I order Starbucks," but it feels more like the "older generation" (Millennial) overblowing a small trait of Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of past generational moral panics, like &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-endanger-casual-dining-restaurants-2017-5" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Millennials killing casual dining&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and 100 other things), &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/the-waves/2022/10/youve-been-trained-to-distrust-womens-voices" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vocal fry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkem" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jenkem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gol-53Be2k0" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rainbow parties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/woke-m-ms-and-8-other-ridiculous-moral-panics-through-1850028075" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;switchblades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the "overly jaunty" rhythm of Bing Crosby's "&lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/639027/bbc-banned-bing-crosby-song" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deep in the Heart of Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;." (To be fair, that shit is fucking &lt;em&gt;jaunty&lt;/em&gt;.) Also: If low-wage workers stare blankly at older people, it might be because they deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

&lt;p&gt;I took a more &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-is-gen-z-stare" target="_blank"&gt;in-depth look at the Gen Z stare here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="viral-video-of-the-week-affair-caught-on-coldplay-jumbotron"&gt;Viral video of the week: Affair caught on Coldplay jumbotron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7527910323681070367"&gt;
    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rare for the entire internet to collectively agree on something, but this week, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, from Baby Boomers to Gen A, shared the same reaction to a viral video: "I'm glad I'm not &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; people." No one needs it explained, I guess, but you don't get more viral than this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video in question was shot at a recent Coldplay concert in Massachusetts. It begins innocently enough: The camera pans to a couple embracing tenderly, and the crowd cheers. But things go south quickly when the pair realize they’re on the Jumbotron and freak out. Their awkward attempts to duck and hide only draw attention to the drama. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin even narrates the moment: “Oh, look at these two,” he says from the stage, before pausing and adding, "Either they’re having an affair, or they’re just very shy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first one, Chris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet quickly identified the couple as Andy Byron, the CEO of tech company called Astronomer who is extremely married to someone who isn't Astronomer's "chief people officer" Kristin Cabot.In the following days, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/business/ex-employee-of-tech-ceo-andy-byron-claims-he-was-a-toxic-boss-before-coldplay-drama/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;former employees came out to shit talk their old boss&lt;/a&gt;, Astronomer's board launched an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/astronomer-andy-byron-coldplay-kiss-cam.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, more than &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/coldplay-kiss-cam-astronomer" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;15 million people read about the event online&lt;/a&gt; (that's as much exposure as the Diddy trial had), and Byron's wife &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/entertainment/astronomer-ceo-andy-byrons-wife-had-happy-family-photos-on-facebook-until-his-affair-was-exposed/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;took the family photos off Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As amusing as all this is, I can't help but feel sympathy for those involved. Imagine that everyone you know—your friends, your family, your co-workers, your second grade teacher—has video proof that you attended a Coldplay concert.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find a nutritious cereal can be like going down the candy aisle — most options are loaded with sugar and are seriously lacking in fiber and protein. At The Takeout, we're passionate about conducting taste tests for our readers, and this time, we compiled a list of &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/best-worst-healthy-cereals-cheerios-kashi-puffins-chex-1849632492/" target="_blank"&gt;eight "healthy" cereals, ranked from worst to best&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are various factors and opinions that define a cereal as "healthy," we based our ranking on the guidelines provided by the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-pick-a-healthy-cereal" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Our top picks are made with whole grains and are low in sugar and sodium. Protein and fiber content were also considered. The cereal that checks all these boxes and delivers a satisfying texture and flavor is also America's favorite cereal as of 2024, according to data collected from &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/cheerios-leads-among-cereal-brands-plus-more-insights-for-national-cereal-day/" target="_blank"&gt;Civic Science&lt;/a&gt;. In its nostalgic, original yellow box version, Cheerios is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the vitamins and minerals Cheerios are fortified with — as well as trisodium phosphate and vitamin E mixed tocopherols for texture and freshness — the cereal is primarily made with whole grain oats, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Since whole grain oats are listed as the first ingredient, they constitute the majority of the product. For a 1½ cup serving of Cheerios without milk, there are 2 grams of sugar (one of which is added sugar), 4 grams of fiber, and 5 grams of protein. However, the product does have slightly more than the desirable amount of sodium per serving at 190 milligrams as opposed to the 140 milligrams recommended by the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Brent Hofacker / 500px/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individuals who look for ingredients that are not genetically modified, original Cheerios are a great option. Cheerios' low sugar content and exceptionally affordable price point give it an additional edge. Depending on the store, a family-sized 18-ounce box of Cheerios can cost approximately $7, whereas competitor Love Grown Power O's are about the same price for only an 8-ounce box. Cheerios also don't taste like cardboard, though they are still considered a processed food. However, compared to other cereals, Cheerios remain one of the more nutritious choices for breakfast or snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people enjoy cereal with milk for breakfast, this alone may not be enough to keep someone satisfied until their next meal. Increasing the protein and healthy fats within a bowl of Cheerios comes in handy here. Add a tablespoon or two of your favorite nuts or seeds or even a drizzle of drippy nut butter on top. Alternatively, as a lower-sugar substitute to granola, Cheerios can be generously sprinkled on top of &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1846562/cottage-cheese-vs-greek-yogurt-better-breakfas/" target="_blank"&gt;cottage cheese or Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; instead of served with milk. Or, take a bold step and try &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1858426/vintage-breakfast-cheerios-hack/" target="_blank"&gt;the vintage toasting hack that will make Cheerios your favorite breakfast&lt;/a&gt; if they aren't already!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

However, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24280-triclosan" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, triclosan can still be found in some toothpastes, deodorants, cosmetics and detergents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QNB4GKQUNVFZLMEMDLV4PXM4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recent study followed 347 mothers and their children from pregnancy through the children’s 12th birthdays. During that period, urinary triclosan concentrations in mother-child pairs were assessed through age 5, and then again at 8 and 12 years old.

    &lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body’s most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain’s security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body’s natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells’ ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol’s effect on the blood vessels’ ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required. They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body’s natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a “clot buster” called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced “blood vessel on a chip” systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts. This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives. While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar’s sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It’s now found in thousands of products, especially in many “sugar-free” and “keto-friendly” foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-many-protein-bars-on-shelf-2472314243"&gt;Stockah/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade-off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Standards Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration, have approved erythritol as safe for consumption. But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even “natural” sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and diabetes prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes. But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain’s protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet. While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out," says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/07/1236721063/the-world-is-facing-a-major-cholera-vaccine-shortage-amid-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trouble in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meeting this target.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries," says Russell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;any country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly how much of a 'game changer'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And one thing is clear to her. "You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak]," she says. "Vaccine can really be a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a "game changer" these stockpiles are — until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/about-us/our-people-and-structure/our-people/nick-scott/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nick Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the&lt;em&gt; British Medical Journal — Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's quite an amazing thing," said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?" says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/360/ruth-karron" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ruth Karron&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. "And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/investing/funding/resource-mobilisation/Gavi-Investment-Opportunity-2026-2030.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;financial planning documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott's team also found that speed really matters. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be," he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months," Russell says. "If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Everything is up for question'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01240-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/06/25/g-s1-74554/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. announcing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to "re-earn the public trust." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So obviously, everything is up for question," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rate at which our bodies age and wear down doesn't necessarily match our actual age, and the differences can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;help predict lifespan&lt;/a&gt; and disease risk. Now, researchers have developed a new tool for assessing biological age from a single brain scan taken halfway through our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool, put together by an international team of scientists, is based on a dataset of 1,037 people born in Dunedin in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. The health of these individuals has been carefully tracked over time, giving scientists a useful long-term database of stats that reflect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;the body's actual age&lt;/a&gt; – not how many birthdays have passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the researchers used those stats to assess biological aging, and train a tool they've called DunedinPACNI – Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging. That sums up its function, which is to match aging to markers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-breakthrough-brain-scans-predict-disease-up-to-9-years-early?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Breakthrough: Brain Scans Predict Disease Up to 9 Years Early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has the potential to quickly assess the body's age to a good degree of accuracy, and from there health and disease risks, including the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;chances of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than needing multiple tests over time, just a single brain scan is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ahmad Hariri from Duke University in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DunedinPACNI takes in 99 key brain measurements to make its assessment, including the thickness of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; – which affects language and thinking – and the volume of gray matter in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had developed DunedinPACNI, they tested it on a variety of data from other health research projects, covering more than 50,000 people in total. It was shown to work well at estimating biological age, and at predicting future health problems such as cognitive impairment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;and heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a tool that offers perfect accuracy each time, but it scores as well as or better than current biological age assessment methods, the researchers say. What's more, it was shown to be useful across different demographic and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/providing-cash-to-low-income-mothers-puts-their-baby-s-brains-on-a-new-wavelength"&gt;socioeconomic groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The link between aging of the brain and body is pretty compelling," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hariri.

Changes in diet or exercise at that point could make a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are particularly interested in predicting the risk of the various types of dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. As people live longer across the world, rates of dementia are increasing, and the best way to tackle the condition could be to stop it developing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really think of it as hopefully being a key new tool in forecasting and predicting risk for diseases, especially  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="168303" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and related dementias, and also perhaps gaining a better foothold on progression of disease," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hariri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00897-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These are tales of recovery, but also of the need for vigilance. For people experiencing mental illness, treatment is not about a cure, but effective management of life as it is. Whether through medicine, therapy or other support, people experiencing an intolerable crisis can find a way back.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) has published a series of research papers detailing their efforts to identify patterns in neurodegenerative disease. Sifting through roughly 250 million plasma measurements, they have discovered a five-protein panel present in APOE ε4 carriers across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The APOE ε4 allele is a genetic variant with a strong association for increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Having one or two copies of the allele elevates the likelihood of developing the disease and experiencing an earlier onset. While it has been a clear genetic marker for risk, APOE ε4 holds no clinical value as a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+target/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug target&lt;/a&gt; as it has no direct causal role in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the much-researched suspects, amyloid and tau protein plaque build up in the brain, seem to escape full causative blame for the disease, suggesting other factors must be at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the GNPC studies, "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03834-0" target="_blank"&gt;The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium: biomarker and drug target discovery for common neurodegenerative diseases and aging&lt;/a&gt;," published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers may have found the biomarkers that have eluded neurodegenerative researchers for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 18,645 participants contributed 31,083 plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples, yielding 35,056 unique proteomic assays drawn from 23 global cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of variation between disease types that typical proteomic analysis would identify as significantly divergent disease drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma analyses identified 27 proteins consistently elevated and 130 reduced in Alzheimer's disease across up to 10 cohorts, enriched for glucose metabolism and vesicle-trafficking pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease samples showed 40 elevated and 15 reduced proteins, with enrichment for Ras-family GTPase signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia profiles revealed nine decreased synaptic-linked proteins, while amyotrophic lateral sclerosis signatures were dominated by skeletal-muscle proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 256-protein LASSO model tracked clinical severity across diagnoses, and organ-specific aging clocks disclosed accelerated artery, liver and intestine aging in Alzheimer's disease and muscle aging in Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden within the protein diversity of disease manifestations, was a signal that tied all of these different profiles together. A five-protein panel (SPC25, NEFL, S100A13, TBCA, LRRN1) predicted APOE ε4 status with area under the curve 0.90–0.96 independent of diagnosis. Accuracy held, returning similarly strong AUC values across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/frontotemporal+dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amyotrophic+lateral+sclerosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the findings from GNPC so far are correlative biomarker signals. No mechanistic experiments or causal inferences are being presented and causality remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These disclaimers and caveats aside, a previously unknown biomarker profile shared across multiple neurodegenerative diseases is exactly the sort of clue that researchers have been needing to pursue disease-modifying strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to Bill Gates, the principal founder of GNPC, "This is the moment to spend more money on research, not less. And this is the time to encourage more collaboration across borders, not less. The rising tides of nationalism and isolationism threaten to stop scientific progress in its tracks, and I hope countries reverse course before we lose too much ground."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates frames this call for cross-border scientific cooperation by pointing to some recent global success stories: "Some of the biggest medical discoveries of the past half-century were made possible through global partnerships. The Human Genome Project—a joint venture by the U.S., UK, Japan, France, Germany and China—paved the way for precision medicine and genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have a vaccine against &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt;, the leading cause of cervical cancer, because research teams in the U.S. and Australia built on the discoveries of a German scientist. And, most recently, it took unprecedented levels of global cooperation to develop vaccines against COVID-19 in record time."&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about learning to trust the process, be gentle with yourself, and keep going even when it’s tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For the days when you feel like you should be further along. Save this for when the in-between feels heavy—and if you’re up for it, how’s your journey really feeling lately?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her post really resonated with other users, who left hundreds of comments about how they feel they are in a strange grey area of their jab journey, even if they have lost enormous amounts of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TikTokker @Swedish_Sandra was inundated with messages from other users 'in the middle' of their journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra is one of the thousands of people currently in the 'middle' of their weight loss journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'The middle is so hard, I have lost ten stone, which is a massive achievement but because I started out at 26 stone, it doesn’t look like the massive transformation I see on other people.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another added: 'The middle is hard. I’ve dropped 54 lbs but I still feel and see a fat girl in the mirror. Certain body parts bother me so much more now than they did before.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were scores of similar messages from other people who had found themselves not feeling familiar with their new, evolving, bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'80lbs with 40 to go, it’s great but it’s so odd to see my stomach now that loose skin is starting to take effect. I don’t feel like my body matches me and everything I do at all ,' said one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others admitted that they were finding this period 'soul crushing' and 'boring' as their final goal 'seems so very far away'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Middle is where I think we really do the work,. It’s triggering, falling into negative feelings and not giving up is the hard bit.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra, who has not revealed how much weight she has lost since starting on Mounjaro around five months ago, responded in the comments, and encouraged her fellow jabbers to keep pushing on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote:  'I completely get that, that initial excitement has died down but you’re not at goal weight yet. Sometimes it feels dull and slow. But those boring moments are the real, steady progress that doesn’t always get the spotlight, even though it’s what really lasts.'&lt;/p&gt;

The video is clearly shot in private, and although it shows her face it doesn’t have her name on it. This girl behaved really badly and completely shattered my friend’s heart, and while I don’t want to believe he would put something like this online, he is so hurt that it’s not outside the realm of possibility. She would lose her job and her career if this video was found, and she comes from a very conservative family. My questions: What are my obligations here? Do I ask my friend about it? Contact the ex? Part of me wishes I could forget that I saw it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="210" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32rm001i3b6h887rl3et@published"&gt;In my day people took sexy Polaroids of each other then hid them in the sock drawer. After a bad breakup, they took the pictures out of the gym sock and burned them. It’s too bad that one can no longer memorialize one’s hotness with such nonchalance. As my colleague Emily Bazelon&lt;a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html"&gt; recently described&lt;/a&gt;, this new plague of revenge porn is ruining lives and there is currently little legal recourse. (California just passed a law making&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/01/california-brown-anti-revenge-porn-bill/2906305/"&gt; posting such material a misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt;.) I talked to expert&lt;a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=028"&gt; Danielle Citron&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and author of the forthcoming book, Hate 3.0, about what can be done for this woman. First of all, contact your friend. If indeed he is the perpetrator, you should tell him that you have now seen the video. Tell him you know his ex did him wrong, but he should not compound the wrongdoing by exacting such vicious revenge. Citron says if he posted to a site where he controls his content, he could simply take down the video. Let’s hope it hasn’t been more widely disseminated and that her name hasn’t gotten attached. But if he gave it to a revenge porn website, then unfortunately he’s really lost control of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sa001r3b6hjwawcllb@published"&gt;You should also contact the ex-girlfriend. She’s entitled to know the bad news, which has the potential for painful professional and personal consequences. Citron says that if the video was a selfie, the woman would own the copyright. In that case it would be worth it for her to hire a lawyer to write a letter to the site operator where it’s being posted without her permission. But its being taken down is far from assured. If the woman is sure that the images were posted by her ex, Citron laid out other legal avenues she could explore, such as filing a civil claim of infliction of emotional distress or seeking criminal harassment action be taken against him. But Citron notes pursuing a civil lawsuit would be expensive and that law enforcement has taken a lax attitude toward these cases. Sadly, because of technology, people need to be aware when giving sexual photographs or videos of themselves to a paramour that love may die, but the images could live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

As I married a year ago, we field endless questions about when we’re going to have kids. My brother just had a baby. His sibling just had a baby. Going on Facebook is an endless parade of their kids from all of our relatives. Discussions are focused solely around their kids, then are turned to us. I keep saying, “We’re happily child-free,” but I’m losing my resolve. I’m constantly surrounded by something I’ll never get to have, but I don’t know how to broach the conversation with our families. I’m afraid the fertility-happy will try and tell us we just haven’t been trying long enough or that God will give us a baby when he sees fit. Based on our finances and the frequency of things falling through, adoption is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, I’ve “opted out” (so has my husband, in solidarity) as we’ve been continually trying to get pregnant in the years since. Last time I flew, the TSA agent roughly groped my vagina and labia, and I had a panic attack. I’ve avoided flying since.&lt;/p&gt;

The timing of your last miscarriage is terrible, and your reluctance at the thought of getting X-rayed again is understandable, but the energy of the X-ray beam of an airport scanner is very low and does not penetrate the skin. According to the &lt;a href="http://hps.org/"&gt;Health Physics Society&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to radiation safety,&lt;/p&gt;

The two primary companies that sell people screeners say that their devices expose people to half that amount of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sb001s3b6hwy0bfir2@published"&gt;For perspective, 0.25 microsievert is also received by flying about a minute and a half (cosmic radiation during commercial flight exposes fliers to about 10 microsievert per hour). It is also received by living for 40 minutes (natural background radiation exposes people to about 0.35 microsievert per hour)…The American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard took into account the varying sensitivity of different groups of people who might be scanned. The authors first looked at a number of reports and published studies on the health effects of radiation. They then chose the 0.25 microsievert dose level to ensure that children and pregnant individuals can be safely scanned with these devices. The x-ray scanner uses a very low-energy and low-intensity radiation, so that an embryo/fetus is not exposed to any radiation that could possibly increase the developmental risks of radiation to the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;

Learn more about anxiety treatments—anything from deep-breathing exercises to &lt;em&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/em&gt; —that you can perform on yourself when you’re feeling cornered in the security line. You can also apply for TSA Pre-Check, which may only require you to go through an old-school metal detector. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vd00123b6h7452l9gf@published"&gt;My husband and I had our third child last fall. And for the third time, my mom pressured me to name her after my late sister, “Paloma.” Like before, I told her no, and we went with our originally planned name. But now my mom is on a push about how I haven’t honored Paloma or shared memories with my kids about her, and that they’re being harmed by missing out on her as an aunt. My 6-year-old and 4-year-old know that I had a sister, but that she’s dead (classic blunt child response). But I haven’t really talked much about her. Now that my parents live closer and see the kids more often, my mom wants to change that. I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001f3b6hj6tdr3aw@published"&gt;Paloma was six years older than me. She died of complications from anorexia in her early 20s. Because of the age difference and her substantial impatient time, we weren’t that close. I honestly felt more relief than anything when she died, because her eating disorder tortured my parents almost as much as it tortured her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vt00183b6heg97eqrk@published"&gt;I know EDs and mental illness in general can be hell, but I genuinely have no good memories of her after she was about 15. She was deeply in the grip of the disorder, and it made her mean, self-destructive, judgmental, and secretive. I have distinct memories of her telling me from her hospital bed that I was fat and unlovable when I was going through puberty. And that’s probably the warmest interaction we had in my teens.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vz00193b6hls9xpux2@published"&gt;I recognize the memories I have aren’t the full version of who she was before she got sick. I loved her, but I didn’t like her. I don’t know what I could possibly pass on to my kids to share about her, besides one or two memories from when I was 7 or 8 years old. I recognize that my mom is grieving, and probably always will be. But I don’t really want to get into the details of Paloma until my kids are teenagers. Is that unfair?&lt;/p&gt;

If not, it might be time to have a heartfelt but brutally honest conversation. Bring some of the specific examples that you shared here. Explain how you don’t really have any positive memories of your sister to pass on—and thus she isn’t a person that you feel you can truly honor in your family.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wz001r3b6h2eoqn2n7@published"&gt;It might be worth pointing out that even though you aren’t fondly remembering Paloma to the kids, you’re not sullying her memory either. Your decision to be neutral about her is a way to be respectful—to both your sister and your mom.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wy001p3b6h8ii568cj@published"&gt;One olive branch you could consider is inviting your mom to tell the kids about Paloma. Of course, there may need to be some guardrails around these conversations. But I suspect your mom fears that Paloma is being erased or forgotten by the family.  That’s a devastating prospect for any parent. Telling her, “I can’t be the one to share Paloma with the kids, but you’re welcome to,” might give you the reprieve you need.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wd001c3b6hcdaqzckb@published"&gt;Still, even with your best intentions, your mom might not be able to hear any of this.  If that’s the case, you might consider whether family therapy could help you have this conversation more effectively. The Paloma you knew is, for all intents and purposes, not the same Paloma your mom knew and loved. She might need a neutral third party to help her come to terms with that painful truth. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

We have an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. The issue we’re facing is that my in-laws have a pool with no fence around it. Because of this, I have refused to let the kids visit their place without my husband and/or me present. My mother-in-law claims that because our kids know how to swim, a fence isn’t necessary—and that installing one would “spoil” her view of the yard. She’s been rather abrasive with me because I refuse to compromise. What can I do to impress upon her that tragedies can still happen, even to kids who know how to swim?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001g3b6h0h572dnb@published"&gt;Your kids, your rules. Ultimately, you’re the one who is responsible for your kids’ well-being, so &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get to decide what you’re comfortable with. There are so many tragedies with backyard pools that robust conversations around pool safety are a must. In the U.S., it’s the third cause of unintentional injury-related death for kids 5 to 19, which you might share with her, along with some of the harrowing stories shared by parents in this &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/child-drowning-pool-swimming-safety.html"&gt;Slate article about preventing such tragedies&lt;/a&gt;. If the science might sway her, you can point her to &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001047/full"&gt;studies that show that pool fencing&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces the risk of drowning. Or that organizations like the &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/shop-the-best-pool-safety-products-for-summer/"&gt;National Drowning Prevention Alliance strongly recommend them&lt;/a&gt; (plus they have suggestions on which to buy).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001e3b6h5q6h13ix@published"&gt;I confess that I am &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a pool owner, but I wonder if some compromise can be found. Would she be more amenable if she knew about the existence of removable fences—one that she can put up and take down at her leisure? Maybe not, since it’ll require additional work on her part. But she could presumably take the fence down if she plans to have company over, for example, or is having a weekend at home without the kids around. There are also &lt;a href="https://usglassfence.com/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-glass-pool-fencing/"&gt;glass pool fences&lt;/a&gt; that could help keep her “view” intact while still providing safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4x4001u3b6hjqh0241b@published"&gt;I wonder whether a broader conversation about all points of pool safety might uncover more common ground with your MIL than you expected. Take the opportunity to talk through other pool precautions the family should be taking beyond fencing. The experts quoted in that earlier Slate article, for example, point out that the most crucial piece of pool safety is close supervision when someone is in the water. They stressed that the person supervising “needs to be constantly attentive, close by (within arm’s reach for a novice swimmer, she says), capable of identifying drowning, and prepared to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4xa001v3b6hokjvgdvn@published"&gt;For the future, it might be worth considering where you’ll stand on the issue when your kids are a bit older. How long would the fence need to stay up for you to be comfortable? Is there an age where you don’t feel like a fence is needed? Perhaps the answer is no, and that’s OK, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wq001l3b6h0cw2xfnw@published"&gt;Realistically, she probably won’t budge, and neither should you. You say you recently just moved, so give it some time. Be kind in your insistence, and as patient as you can be when she expresses her refusal to change her yard, as is her right. Hopefully, she will (begrudgingly) get used to your rules. Demand safety, but don’t let the fence come between you if it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

The thing is, my parents are divorced and cannot stand each other—yet both want to be at the hospital, outside the delivery room, so they can see the baby immediately. I’m worried they will cause a scene (as they have at multiple family events) during what will already be a very stressful and emotionally fraught time. My husband says he doesn’t trust them to keep it together and wants to make them wait and see the baby separately in the hospital room. This will be their first grandchild. Should I give them a chance, or is my husband right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006s3b6hcvzy6unx@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Delivery Drama,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006t3b6htduj96mp@published"&gt;Let me clarify a few things. You say your parents want to be outside the delivery room so they can see the baby immediately. Have you done a hospital tour yet? I delivered in two different facilities, and in both cases, anyone not directly assisting with the birth was kept down the hall, through a secure door, in a designated waiting area—essentially “on hold” until the baby and afterbirth were delivered and mom was cleaned up. So before you make this decision, be sure you know your hospital’s procedures and set your parents’ expectations accordingly. (While you’re at it, you might also inquire whether the hospital has separate waiting rooms, where both parents could wait but stay apart.)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006u3b6hpr0ticrv@published"&gt;It’s also important to keep in mind that you have no idea how your birth is going to go. Most of the women I know experienced both intense joy and intense vulnerability in those post-first-birth hours. Some wanted to see people right away—eager to enjoy their baby with their loved ones. Others felt overwhelmed or in so much discomfort that they only wanted their spouse and child nearby. And for some, what they wanted after the baby was born was the opposite of what they’d planned beforehand. So be upfront with yourself and your loved ones that any plan you make is subject to change at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006v3b6hdslpi4yd@published"&gt;Which brings me to one of my two most important points in this reply: Your letter told me what your parents want, and what your husband wants. What do you want? Because, as the owner of the VIU (Very Important Uterus), the way this day goes is ultimately your call. It’s arguably the only time in your life when you can make demands that others must simply fulfill.  If you want your parents to meet the baby together, then brush up on your mediation skills and set some non-negotiable ground rules. If you’d rather tell everyone to take a chill pill and wait, that’s your prerogative, too. You get to decide what this looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006w3b6h8msvuppw@published"&gt;Since this is an advice column, though, I’ll give you my personal opinion. If it were me, I’d let the grandparents meet the baby first—before any other siblings or family who might also be in the waiting room—but only once I felt settled and ready. And I would have them meet the baby separately rather than together. This is a huge milestone, not only for you and your husband, but also for your parents (especially if this is their first grandchild). I wouldn’t want anyone to ruin that for you or themselves, and I would be nervous that putting them in a room together is setting them up to fail. I don’t want that for any of you. And I’d flip a coin (in advance and in full view) to decide who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006x3b6herj9fget@published"&gt;I will close with the second of my two most important points: This birth is just the beginning. Once the baby is born, your parents are going to want to be present for many more events, from birthday parties and religious rites to band concerts. If I were in your shoes, I’d start demanding that they grow up and learn how to be in the same room with each other. Your child deserves no less, and your life will be much easier if you don’t have to keep asking versions of this same question over the next 18-plus years. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the only way I knew how to put it. So many things could set her off: new carpeting, air fresheners, plastic off-gassing, diesel. Perfumes were among the worst offenders. On top of that, she developed terrible food allergies. The sound of her sniffling became the chorus of my childhood. Some days she couldn’t get out of bed. I’d peek into her darkened room and see her face pinched in discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Her joints ached, her head swam. Doctors suggested that maybe she was depressed or anxious. “Well, you’d be anxious too if you couldn’t lick an envelope, couldn’t pick up your daughter in a car,” she’d reply. She tried allergists, got nowhere. Finally, she found her way to holistic health, whose practitioners told her she had something called multiple chemical sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As long as people have complained that man-made stuff in their environment causes health problems—migraines and asthma, exhaustion and mood swings—the medical establishment has largely dismissed them. The American Medical Association, World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy &amp;amp; Immunology don’t recognize chemical sensitivity as a diagnosis. If they talk about it at all, they tend to dismiss it as psychosomatic, a malady of the neurotic and health-obsessed. Why, these authorities wondered, would people react to minute traces of a huge array of chemicals? And why couldn’t they ever seem to get better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This isn’t some trivial affliction. Roughly a quarter of American adults report some form of chemical sensitivity; it lives alongside chronic pain and fibromyalgia as both evidently real and resistant to mainstream diagnosis or treatment. My mom tried a thousand things—elimination diets, antihistamines, lymphatic massage, antidepressants, acupuncture, red light therapy, saunas, heavy-metal detoxes. Sometimes her symptoms eased, but she never got better. Her illness ruled our lives, dictating what products we bought, what food we ate, where we traveled. I felt there had to be an answer for why this was happening. It didn’t take me long to learn that, if there was one, it’d come from a figure as unassuming as she is provocative: the scientist Claudia Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;On a warm&lt;/span&gt; Texas afternoon, Miller and her affable husband, Bob, lead me through the San Antonio Botanical Garden. A monarch flits by. “I’ve noticed so many fewer butterflies, so many fewer birds, even the last couple of years,” Miller observes. Her raspy voice comes out so quietly that, at times, my recording device fails to pick it up. People are perpetually leaning in close or asking her to repeat herself. At 78, Miller typically uses a cane, but Bob gets the walker out of the car so she can cover more distance. She wears her silver hair in a low side ponytail, fixed in place with a scrunchie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;With her wide, thin-rimmed glasses, Miller disappears into the scenery, but she’s a particularly visible presence in her field. Now a professor emeritus at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Miller has held several federal appointments, chaired National Institutes of Health meetings, testified before Congress, consulted for the Environmental Protection Agency, authored dozens of papers, and worked with the Canadian, German, Japanese, and Swedish governments. In all this, she has tried to make sense of and raise awareness for chemical intolerance. One patient advocate I interviewed called her “Saint Claudia” for her commitment to overlooked and misunderstood patients. Kristina Baehr, an attorney who defends victims of toxic exposures, told me, “To have experts like Dr. Miller tell them you’re not crazy, this is very real, is very life-giving to people. She’s able to validate their experience with facts, with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One such fact, Miller explains, is this: Over the past century, the United States has undergone a chemical revolution. “Fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas, their combustion products, and then their synthetic chemical derivatives are mostly new since World War II,” she says. “Plasticizers, forever chemicals, you name it: These are all foreign chemicals.” They’re everywhere you look, in homes and offices, parks and schools. They’re also, Miller believes, making people very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 1997, Miller proposed a career-defining theory of how people succumb to this condition. It came with a technical-sounding name, toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, and a convenient acronym, TILT. You can lose tolerance after one severe exposure, Miller says, or after a series of smaller exposures over time. In either case, a switch is flipped: Suddenly, people are triggered by even tiny amounts of everyday substances—cigarette smoke, antibiotics, gas from their stoves—that never bothered them before. These people become, in a word, TILT-ed. It’s not unlike developing an allergy, when the body labels a substance as dangerous and then reacts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQTE1VOFoxS3dibkJZUEZIQ1c1ODRuSXEzb1pGbEhOZE1PVUtHQUZxMHhTR1JiYjFMTUYxY1RYejVRMTh4UldMVnhLbUlCVnVaUlY3QmlKcDlFVFp2YjJmRmRycjNqcnFRWk1haVhPOVNBd3JfeV9qaTA4VnFTeHhwVVh1UGM</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）将死-有线 | Bryan Johnson Is Going to Die - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1wVno0X1g0QkxqWkpjMlpOYzRFa2VWUU5fWnZLbl91Z0FNcDBsbDlqY2lWY2Vac1hZaWVNSEZJUEJya0dBcjBjRnA4VVNKcDV4bnAwYUtlQl9WS25pUWVZaWlHV0JGZzg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;At first, the&lt;/span&gt; two bowls of fruit on Bryan Johnson’s kitchen island look perfect. They’re brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That estate, it’s worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson’s home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you’d assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body’s aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If the rotting fruit didn’t give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson’s stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father’s anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson’s blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson’s walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Performance, of course, is Johnson’s specialty. There’s the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there’s how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times investigation&lt;/a&gt; into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Over a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce. He also took great pains to convince me—and all of you—that this wasn’t just about health and longevity. No, like most tech men living in boxy modernist homes and saddled with illusions of grandeur, Johnson has a new holy grail with which to galvanize his faithful following: artificial intelligence, baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GroupCalloutWrapper-bPWknp dhHsN callout callout--group callout--group-2" data-testid="GroupCalloutWrapper"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE imJESW caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd iJViBS yzpFe caption__credit"&gt;PHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE imJESW caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd iJViBS yzpFe caption__credit"&gt;PHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE DRUMMOND: I’m going to ask you a very simple true-or-false question that you can answer however you want.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of Texas measles cases tied to a West Texas outbreak slows to a trickle, South Plains public health director Zach Holbrooks remembers the call from a colleague in an adjacent county six months ago that would change both his — and the state’s — entire 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Katherine was the first person to let me know there was a case,” said Holbrooks, referring to Lubbock’s public health director, Katherine Wells. A Mennonite child from Seminole’s Gaines County — one of four counties under Holbrooks’ charge — had been hospitalized in Lubbock with measles. “So that’s what got the communication rolling between me and Katherine and the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From that first case reported on Jan. 29, the outbreak in West Texas would make up the largest single cluster of measles cases since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, killing two and spreading to multiple states. As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;762 people have been infected&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the previous U.S. record from 2019, when an outbreak among the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City resulted in 649 cases. Nationwide, the United States is suffering its worst measles outbreak in nearly three decades with the West Texas outbreak making up more than half of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,309 cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While it’s been more than a month since a new case has been reported in Gaines County, cases traced back to West Texas continue to be reported across the state in East Texas’ Lamar and Fannin counties, where this week saw the addition of nine new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Technically, Gaines and Lubbock counties are no longer considered active outbreak counties. The spread here seems to have run its course. “They either got the vaccine, the booster or the real thing,” said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff of Seminole Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the region catches its breath and wait for the entire outbreak to end, health professionals like Holbrooks, Wells and Parkey, as well as the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), have all been considering what worked and what could be improved after working the first real infectious disease test, post COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their answers included better reporting of cases at the patient level, more help with streamlining the testing process at the start and surprisingly, a more balanced treatment approach that was not solely fixated on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As of Friday, DSHS has spent more than $10.6 million in outreach, testing and resource support to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;h3 id="47064a77-1074-4298-a283-63d19731e038" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;How the West Texas outbreak posed significant challenges &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After that first fateful phone call in late January between Wells and Holbrooks, the two looked not to the 2019 New York City outbreak as a guide in how to respond, but to an outbreak that occurred five years earlier, in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;They both pored over a&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295"&gt; New England Journal of Medicine article&lt;/a&gt; that detailed how that 2014 outbreak impacted a largely unvaccinated Amish population but was mostly contained from spreading. In that case, two unvaccinated men who had traveled to the Philippines to perform relief work had returned to their community with measles. Eventually the outbreak would spread to 383 residents over nine counties before being declared over four months later. Like the West Texas outbreak, about 90% of those infected in Ohio were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I kind of wanted to just wrap my mind around how long, what kind of response are we going to be looking at?” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Surprisingly, the bulk of the spread in Texas occurred in a four month period, also.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That timespan and the fact that Ohio’s involved a branch of Anabaptists, a 16th century Christian movement that believes strongly in separation of church and state, was helpful to Holbrooks. He grew up in Seminole, home to a large population of Mennonites, also a part of the Anabaptist denomination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both Amish and Mennonite communities have no formal opposition to vaccination but many of their followers are unvaccinated, prompting Holbrooks to immediately seek out community leaders to help spread the word about the outbreak and that vaccination was the best weapon to keep measles from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the Ohio outbreak seemed a better comparison than the New York one because it occurred outside a large metro area, there were sharp differences between the 2014 cluster and that in Gaines, underscoring the unique challenges Texas health officials and beyond were up against.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Ohio, most measles cases were located in areas that reported an overall 95% vaccination, enough to ensure herd immunity. More importantly, the Ohio outbreak had occurred before the coronavirus pandemic, years before vaccination fatigue from a global pandemic set in.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By comparison, Gaines County’s vaccination rate had dropped far below the herd immunity level, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/04/west-texas-measles-outbreak-mennonite-seminole/"&gt;to 82%&lt;/a&gt; and the number of seventh graders who had filed a conscientious exemption for at least one vaccination with local schools, had grown from 2% in 2014, long before COVID-19,of seventh graders had a vaccination exemption. In 2024, it was nearly 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas outbreak also involved a more mobile population. Seminole in Gaines County is located 35 miles from New Mexico and involved a largely unvaccinated population that traveled often long distances: to Mennonite communities in Mexico and Canada as well as those located in northeastern Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their penchant for traveling made it harder for public officials to contain the spread, which eventually would lead to cases in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Oklahoma, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas, Illinois, Colorado and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5741ba72-fa6a-494f-917e-c9c134b4777a" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Undercounting of measles cases&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;To better track the spread and stop it, the state has worked with local providers and health departments to carefully document exactly how many measles infections occur. To do that, public health officials rely on local providers and hospitals to inform them when there is a case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, that number is likely an undercount because it is based on patients treated, not those who ride out the virus from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Statistically, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/measles-is-making-a-comeback-can-we-stop-it-202503063091"&gt;up to three measles cases per every 1,000 &lt;/a&gt;measles results in death. Gaines had two deaths, which would indicate the number of infections were far greater than the 441 reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Not everybody who gets sick goes to the hospital,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Among the more popular places for infected Mennonites to seek out health care was with Lubbock physician Ben Edwards, who treated hundreds of patients in a temporary clinic in Seminole. The Mennonite’s skepticism of mainstream medicine elevated Edwards — who denounced vaccines and promoted vitamin A and budesonide, something more commonly used to treat asthma, as alternative prevention and treatment options — to a medical hero for the religious community.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the local hospital in Seminole regularly reported to Holbrooks’ office every measles patient it treated, information from local providers, such as Edwards, was tougher to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was frustrating,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Reporting cases quickly to local health authorities helps them respond more quickly to keep disease from spreading, as well as to keep cases from becoming more serious where hospitalization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Emails obtained by The Texas Tribune through a public information request hint at how Holbrooks’ office had to spend extra time retrieving that information from Edwards, who like all physicians&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/investigation/Reporting-forms/notifiable-conditions-2025-bw.pdf"&gt; are to report “immediately” to local or regional health officials&lt;/a&gt; measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’ve seen multiple news reports indicating that your clinic in Seminole has treated upwards of 300 individuals for measles in Gaines County,” Holbrooks wrote Edwards in an April 14 letter, three months after the first measles case. “After reviewing our records, we have not received any corresponding case reports from your office.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually Holbrooks’ office received a list of patient names and their dates of birth but few other details. Edward apologized for the lateness, attributing it to a communication error with a community translator who was assisting him with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She and I had a miscommunication, as I had instructed her to send that list to the local health authority but she thought I had sent it,” Edwards told the Tribune. “Once I was made aware of this oversight, it was immediately corrected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5909fc21-1383-4b0c-8256-f06fb014ea06" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Lessons learned &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials’ measles messaging focused on getting the word out on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Once he reached out to community leaders, Holbrooks worked to get public health messaging aired in both English and the Mennonites’ dialect of informal or Low German.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Holbrooks had wanted to put more vaccination and field clinics closer to the Mennonites but quickly saw that doing so would attract too much attention. News of the outbreak brought a sudden influx of national reporters to tiny Seminole, forcing many locals to shy away from pop-up vaccination clinics where TV cameras and photographers were stationed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually, Seminole health workers moved to a drive-through vaccination clinic through their local show barn, a local livestock exhibition facility used by youth groups, allowing more privacy for those interested in obtaining a measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even 75 miles north in Lubbock, Wells, the city’s public health director, found that public vaccination spots, while often a hallmark of back-to-school events in August, were not as big a draw in the larger city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both she and Holbrooks recognized later that focusing on vaccination from the start could have sent a message that vaccines were the only option for treatment, possibly dissuading more susceptible residents or those with milder measles cases from asking questions or getting more help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have one more of a treatment clinic [model] and had more boots on the ground, working with churches … to engage better with the Mennonite community,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;These vaccine clinics could have been made less clinical and paired with other options, such as checking oxygen levels and passing out Pedialyte to help infected patients stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Such an approach could have invited more visitors and conversation, resulting in better triaging of residents and letting them know to seek more help from the local hospitals, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have found a way to set up something that was free, kind of caring for people with measles, not saying you’re like this infectious person,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From inside Seminole Memorial Hospital, Parkey said his facility was fending for itself as measles cases began arriving in force in February and March.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He would have liked more outreach to the private medical care sector from state and local public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We couldn’t stop seeing people. Someone could [have] come out and talk to us,” Parkey said, adding that his experience with public health during COVID was similar. “No one talked to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He wished he had more help with offering &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;faster test results to patients&lt;/a&gt;. Most hospitals either contracted with local testing labs or sent patient samples for testing in the state’s lab in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Parkey said the emphasis at the start of the outbreak on vaccines didn’t change minds, especially among his Mennonite patients and he believes it may have hardened the vaccine skepticism of many. In both measles-related deaths, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;anti-vaccine outfits&lt;/a&gt; like Children’s Health Defense stoked doubt about whether the virus was the cause of the children’s fatalities or if it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The group’s founder, current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/29/texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/"&gt;came to Seminole&lt;/a&gt; after the death of a second child and met with Mennonite families. Although Kennedy is no longer with the group, his history of &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/factcheck-org-kennedy-cites-flawed-paper-in-bid-to-justify-vaccine-autism-link/"&gt;false statements about vaccines&lt;/a&gt; together with that personal visit reinforced for many the view that the government should stay out of individual health decisions particularly related to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Anywhere you have a bunch of people who don’t believe in vaccines, you’re going to see it,” he said of downplaying measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells admits that one of the lessons from COVID is that public health officials had a &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;hard time learning to bend and pivot quickly in reaction&lt;/a&gt; to both the ever-morphing virus and the growing knowledge about who was at the greatest risk. By not communicating effectively and immediately when restrictions and advice changed, the public felt a constant whiplash of conflicting information and quickly began tuning out medical updates and vaccination alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of measles cases began to taper in April and May, so did the messaging, a sign perhaps that public health is learning to pivot more quickly to a community’s reaction to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vaccination was — and is still — touted as the best preventive measure against becoming infected by local and state public health officials. But, by &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/west-texas-measles-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;early April&lt;/a&gt;, three days after Kennedy’s Seminole visit, the state health agency posted guidance about vitamin A dosage in response to requests from infected residents for ways to ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We kind of shifted to harm reduction,” said Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We always want to give the message that’s going to do the most good to people. If that means vaccination messaging takes a back seat, then we have to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;

I was getting closer to what I would describe as a nebula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a big cloud of colors moving that were changing. Everything was vivid stars. I was just floating peacefully.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna initially dismissed her symptoms as the flu which her children had recently recovered from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna suffered a major heart attack—also known as a 'widow-maker' heart attack given its scarily low survival rate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not once did I remember or relive any bad parts of life. Everything that I thought about was the connections I had made with people or places while I was alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was just all the good stuff.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, family members had called emergency services—medics arrived just 13 minutes later and were able to resuscitate her, saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Referring to Ms Tanner as a 'miracle' case, her cardiologist said: 'In a 20-year career and over 4,000 surgeries, I've never seen anything like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't even know people could survive this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Ms Tanner arrived in hospital, cardiologists implanted a heart pump and a stent to widen the narrowed artery—a procedure which usually requires heart bypass surgery—and restore blood flow to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after just ten days in hospital—six of which she spent in intensive care—the mother-of-three walked out on her own, unaided by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet her recovery has been far from easy, seeing her gain almost three stone—which she has since lost—and suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna's X-ray shows a blockage in the LMCA, which supplies most of the heart muscle with life-giving blood and oxygen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fire department reached Jenna's home within 13 minutes, providing a life-saving service which saw Jenna walk out of hospital just 10 days after suffering a serious heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has to take thirteen different types of medication to manage her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fire department, which came to Ms Tanner's rescue as it was closest to where she lived, has since received an award for reaching her in record time and providing life-saving care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A widowmaker heart attack occurs when a blood clot completely obstructs the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the most critical artery of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, this can cut-off life-giving oxygen to the heart and the muscle can die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if a person receives immediate treatment, this sort of heart attack can cause irreversible tissue damage that can permanently affect the functioning of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now urging health authorities to update current guidelines so more people can be tested for early warning signs—potentially saving thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner’s case comes amid a worrying rise in premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes, which last year reached their highest level in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has previously reported that the number of under-40s treated by the NHS for heart attacks is also climbing, with soaring obesity rates and related health issues believed to be key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, around 420 people of working age die of as a result of heart disease each week, totalling an alarming 21,975 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is America's number one killer and nearly 1million people die of it every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2fSAVZBVV95cUxNVXdnVUQ4OXhzNlJiUmJGbjBJYjNsbEhKcWdPZ2pYNHhyUnkzY3FhZmlfNTdfd05UakMtazNGcmxVd1lzZW4xTV84SG5ZRGdSLXhnYUNFUQ</guid></item><item><title>基因检测可以预测肥胖的几率，从而进行早期干预- NBC新闻 | A genetic test could predict the odds of obesity, allowing for early interventions - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c517a0" class="body-graf"&gt;A genetic test may one day predict a child’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-dipped-us-adults-rcna183952" target="_blank"&gt;obesity in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd846c" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain genetic variants can affect how a person’s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating.

The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c</guid></item><item><title>青少年正试图大量摄入蛋白质补充剂。父母应该注意什么？ - NPR | Teens are trying to bulk up on protein supplements.

                &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/a&gt; last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals.

   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school, and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine," he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: "My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of body building and the gyms."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Protein supplements are big on social media, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;influencers are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day," says &lt;a href="https://chear.org/people/faculty-investigators/sarah-clark" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sarah Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist and co-director of &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good," she says. "We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy," she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78474" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietician Abriana Cain says.

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much is enough? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is also such a thing as &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;protein, says Abriana Cain, a &lt;a href="https://www.childrensnational.org/get-care/departments/clinical-nutrition-services/meet-the-team" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric dietician with Children's National Hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt, and a cup of black beans.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidney and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. "They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. &lt;a href="https://nagatalab.ucsf.edu/people/jason-nagata-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act%20(DSHEA)%20amended%20the,has%20not%20been%20chemically%20altered." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so they're not tested, and their ingredients aren't verified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle building supplements and products," he says. "I would just be very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Eating disorders are up&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Separately, Nagata is concerned that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7483647/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein craze is contributing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812520?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2023.46012" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarming &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813513#:~:text=A%20study%20in%20Canada%20of,of%20improved%20screening%20and%20detection." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase in eating disorders among boys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past two decades, worldwide. He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports. "He's focusing on getting into college."&lt;/p&gt;

The body does not react to cholesterol build-up in the arteries until there is a blockage, which can lead to heart attacks (reduced blood flow to the heart) and stroke (oxygen being cut-off to the brain).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If not treated on time, it can lead to disability and even death. In fact, as per a WHO estimate, raised cholesterol levels are behind 2.6 million deaths and 29.7 million disability-adjusted life years globally each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/12/17/550x309/h_1671275024049_1671275057480_1671275057480.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Cholesterol are fat-like substances that help in the making of hormones.

However, high amounts of cholesterol can cause cardiovascular diseases.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of symptoms in conditions like dyslipidemia leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, missing the critical window for preventive intervention and lifestyle correction. Most patients do not seek medical help until it is too late, mainly because the symptoms which have been enlisted below are too common place and ranges from:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling out of breath during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart Palpitations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about the condition in an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Nihar Mehta, interventional cardiologist at Jaslok Hospital in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mumbai, shared, “Dyslipidemia is a highly treatable condition and can be managed with proper medication and lifestyle changes. Total cholesterol test looks for levels of LDL (bad cholesterol), HDL (good cholesterol), and Triglycerides. For high-risk population, those with familial hypercholesterolemia, obesity and diabetes, an inherited disease that causes high LDL levels, routine lipid profiling, especially in high-risk or sedentary individuals, is essential to detect dyslipidemia early and initiate timely management to avoid long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The optimal lipid level varies depending on the individual’s age, sex and other risk factors but generally, the following ranges are recommended:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; more than 40 mg/dL for men and more than 50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triglycerides:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 150 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 200 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to beat this deadly cholesterol disorder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting healthier habits can significantly improve lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular risks. Dr Mehta suggested, “Lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage but not necessarily cure dyslipidemia. Regular medication adherence is essential for better outcomes. If lipid is higher than optimal, avoid foods high in cholesterol, saturated fats, trans fats, added sugars and salt. Make sure to exercise for at least 150 minutes every week. Maintaining a healthy weight and body mass index, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake are all recommended.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/07/04/Pictures/_84664e3e-41a0-11e6-8e05-c384b245cd95.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="NAFLD can also lead to insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease can affect lipid levels or increase the risk of cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is important to remain compliant with all medications and be consistent with follow-ups with your healthcare provider. A proactive approach is essential for preventing complications and protecting long-term heart health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
