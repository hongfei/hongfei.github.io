The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth, as in Crews's case, but for some people, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood, when a child's growth is not as expected for their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both her parents and two siblings are of average height, and like around 80 percent of children with achondroplasia, Crews inherited the condition due to a mutation in the FGFR3 gene that occurred at the time of conception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up with achondroplasia was extremely difficult, Crews says, and she remembers her mother constantly fearing for her life as the condition can cause sudden death syndrome due to brainstem compression and dangerous breathing problems like sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her childhood was marred by frequent trips to hospitals for treatments and to meet with various specialists as dwarfism can cause complications, including bowed legs, spinal curvature, ear infections and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews also remembers feeling like a 'show dog' because of her small stature, and people would frequently come up to her to pat her head and give her 'fake' compliments to make her feel better, which she said left her feeling confused and angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was when she turned 16 and realized she would never grow any taller that Crews decided to undergo 'taboo' limb lengthening surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Chandler Crews underwent three limb-lengthening procedures. Left, at her mature adult height of 3'10' and, right, at the end of her treatments, standing just over 4'11″ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening is controversial in the dwarfism community because it's a painful, expensive, and risky procedure with a high complication rate, and some believe it promotes the idea that short stature is a defect to be 'fixed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on her website, Crews said: 'I felt like I was never in my own body. I felt like my energy was wasting time in the body it wasn't meant to be in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to wait for the world to change to fit my needs; I wanted to take charge and change for myself and no one else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've noticed within the dwarfism community, some may feel that when someone else with dwarfism changes or alters their own body, that it's an insult to everyone with that 'body type.' But it's not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just like everyone else in the world, our bodies are our own, and no one, even if you have the same diagnosis as them, should have any say in what you do or don't do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2010, when she was 16 years old, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the thigh or shin bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod) to slowly pull the bone segments apart over several weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bones are extended by around 1 millimeter per day, and during the 'distraction phase,' new bone forms in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the desired length is reached, the device is removed, and the new bone is left to fuse back together before the individual can regain full mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no precise, readily available national figures on the total number of limb lengthening surgeries performed annually in the US, but the procedure is performed for both dwarfism-related and cosmetic reasons, with cosmetic height-lengthening procedures increasing in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crews estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are fewer than 50,000 people with achondroplasia in the US. The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her spine health, she was able to have them mostly paid for by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bow legs, also known as genu varum, is a condition where the knees curve outward, causing a gap between them when the feet are together. Left untreated, the long-term consequences of bowed legs in adults can include chronic joint pain, progressive arthritis, instability, and restricted mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews described the limb lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The initial post-surgery recovery from her first surgery consisted of two to three hours of personal training sessions five days a week and daily exercises and stretches, which she did in her own time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Crews' bones were in the right position for the fixators to be removed from her first leg lengthening surgery, it was April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'After removal, I had one month of no weight-bearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was cleared to fully weight-bear, I did have to re-learn how to walk, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used a walker for about two weeks, then two quad canes for about a week, then down to one. By June, I was walking unassisted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In August 2010, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures. Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crews described her first leg lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After starting the process to get her legs lengthened, Crews also went about getting her arms lengthened so they would be in proportion with the rest of her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says people with dwarfism who opt to do leg lengthening usually opt to get their arms done too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting this procedure done, Crews points out, is important for a range of activities, from being able to drive a car to reaching into the refrigerator comfortably.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For her arm lengthening, Crews had fixators implanted in January 2012 when she was 17 years old and then removed the following August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said of the procedure: 'This time, I only had fixators on my humerus [the bone of the upper arm], which meant I was mobile [able to walk].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because you don't bear weight in your arms, the consolidation or fusing phase can be slower as weight-bearing tends to help bone consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As for the physical therapy, I did personal training two to three times a week. After removing my fixators, I had about a month of no heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The arm lengthening procedure saw Crews gain four inches in her arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews went in for a second and then third leg lengthening in May 2013 when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. The average height for a woman varies globally, but in the US, it is 5'3.5".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'In full transparency, I also wanted to be more able-bodied. It was not just about being taller but also more proportionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When it came to height (lengthening legs), I didn't want to rely on stepstools and other forms of assistance constantly. Yes, it was my 'norm,' but it never felt like independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having longer arms, I can now reach the top of my head (wash it easier, high ponytails, safely use hairstyling tools, etc.), sit a safer distance away from the steering wheel when driving, not have to alter sleeves, deal with feminine hygiene – changing tampons, wiping front-to-back, not needing to use a bidet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 4'11' I'm still really short, but I'm what I call (for myself) a "comfortable short."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crew estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her health, she was able to claim them on insurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Now standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organization aims to help drive awareness for new research and advancements surrounding pharmaceutical and surgical treatments and offer vital support resources to individuals and their families. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now happy with her help and living independently with less pain, Crews concludes: 'Everyone wants to feel normal, and that’s how I feel now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m honestly so tired of trying to make sure I don’t say ‘normal’ (because the word ‘normal’ is so frowned upon in the dwarfism community). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m not a little person, and inside I never felt like I was. I’ve never been a dwarf either. I’m just Chandler and I have achondroplasia. It’s a life-long medical diagnosis I will always deal with and fear of passing on to my future children. Babies have died from complications of achondroplasia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Children have died from complications of achondroplasia.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is having a moment. Walk the aisles at a grocery store and you'll see row upon row of protein chips, protein muffins, protein cereal, even protein candy bars. Entire industries are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/well/youbar-protein-bar-lab.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;emerging&lt;/a&gt; around the creation and processing of these novelty products. Processed protein is big business, and Americans are buying it: In a recent &lt;a href="https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, over 70 percent of Americans said they tried to increase their protein intake this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But American diets aren’t actually short on protein. They're short on &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/Pdf/0910/Table_1_Nin_Gen_09.Pdf"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and vitamins and minerals that come not from any one macronutrient but from a variety of natural, whole foods—things with leaves and skins and seeds—instead of the ultra-processed foods that make up the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/well/eat/americans-are-eating-slightly-less-ultraprocessed-food-cdc-data-shows.html"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of the average American’s diet. Indeed, the disconnect between Americans’ desires and their ideal diets is such that the latest version of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-us-dietary-guidelines-come-before-august-kennedy-says-2025-05-14/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August, is &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-report-2025-11697882"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to emphasize the importance of protein—but from plant-based sources, over meat and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? A number of factors have contributed to the reign of protein as a health-food virtue-signal: the rise of Ozempic and doctors’ calls for GLP-1 drug users to eat more of it to keep up muscle tone, the influence of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and its skepticism of ultra-processed products over whole foods, and above all, consumers’ desire to marry health (or the appearance of it) with convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last factor is the reason why, despite what Kennedy’s dietary guidelines may advise, the rise of protein consciousness seems unlikely to move the needle on the nutrition-related health crises—overweight and obesity, heart disease, diabetes—that plague the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;majority of Americans&lt;/a&gt;. Protein alone can't make America healthy again, but it's an enticing shortcut that more consumers are taking with every processed protein product—and most of them are very, very processed—that hits the shelves. To be able to recognize all this junk in health-food clothing, one first has to understand Americans’ love affair with fast food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall seemed to be the inflection point for protein. In August, Kennedy yoked his MAHA movement to the Trump presidential campaign, giving health-consciousness—and skepticism of anything considered “unhealthy”—an energized platform beyond social media and the doctor’s office. The new class of weight-loss drugs—that is, Ozempic and its fellows—had also been approved by the FDA. By September the market was ripe for a new kind of convenience food, and that's when Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, &lt;a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/vital-pursuit-nationwide-glp-1"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new line of high-protein frozen meals targeted at weight-loss drug users. Grouped under the brand name Vital Pursuit, the meals are marketed as the perfect convenience food for newly health-conscious consumers: The cauliflower crust pepperoni pizza packs 22 grams of protein for under 400 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pizza tastes like a cardboard prototype of a pizza. Measuring just over six inches in diameter, made with that trendy cauliflower crust and topped with reduced-fat mozzarella cheese, it’s “air fryer ready . . . for added convenience.” The pie I unwrapped from its plastic boasted a grand total of four pepperoni, a shockingly orange sauce, and a nifty kind of topping formulation that popped off the crust in a single disk when accidentally knocked against the baking sheet. It is convenient, yes, but it does not look healthy. Nor does it taste that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did taste, however, much like every frozen pizza I’d eaten in my childhood: a monoflavor vaguely reminiscent of tomato, cheese, and flour—and strongly reminiscent of Friday nights, when my family and I ate frozen pizzas and watched Disney movies. This rush of nostalgia made me realize something that Nestlé knows well: When it comes to food, the important thing is how one feels about it. And if consumers now want to feel healthy while indulging in ultra-processed foods—well, just add protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a wolf in sheep’s clothing that Americans should recognize by now. While the term “junk food” has been around for a long time, figuring out what exactly is wrong with it is a recent, and quite popular, endeavor. Dieting took off in the late 1800s and ultra-processed foods began to appear early in the next century, but American obesity rates started rising at a steep rate in the 1970s as fast food and convenience meals—and the advertising of them—really took off. The theories about the reasons behind this nationwide weight gain are many, and many have a grain of truth: too few fruits and vegetables, sedentary lifestyles, poverty, food deserts. As the problem continues to worsen, people point fingers in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thread that unites all of these complex causes is the idea that Americans &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to lose weight—through diets, programs, drugs, apps, and more—and then they confront reality in the form of a fast-food sign. The idea that our diets are a problem really gripped the nation with the 2001 publication of Eric Schlosser’s hit book &lt;em&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/em&gt;, which argued that quintessential American restaurants aggressively marketed food that they knew was unhealthy—especially to children, to get them hooked for life. The investigative reporter Michael Moss expanded this idea to all processed food in a popular 2013 exposé, claiming that companies formulate their products to hit the “&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130401012639/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=4"&gt;bliss point&lt;/a&gt;”—that is, the irresistible combination of salt, sugar, and fat that keeps customers coming back for more, presumably forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before MAHA, then, Americans were hearing the claim that junk food was intrinsically addictive because of what’s in it. But as fast food companies responded to the backlash by &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sodium-still-high-in-fast-food-and-processed-foods-201305166267"&gt;promising to lower&lt;/a&gt; fat and salt content over the next few years, some researchers noticed something odd: Americans’ weight wasn’t decreasing, and neither was their consumption of fast and fatty foods—in fact, the opposite was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some researchers couldn’t help but wonder whether it wasn’t so much the ingredients of foods, but the way these ingredients were treated by food manufacturers. Chris van Tulleken’s 2023 book &lt;em&gt;Ultraprocessed People &lt;/em&gt;argued that the processing itself—the stripping or “refining” of flours, the “isolating” of proteins and “hydrolyzing” of fats—makes what was once food into something that the body can’t digest. He, along with many other medical professionals, claimed that eating ultra-processed food leads to diseases like those linked to obesity: Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome. And the food industry essentially regulates itself thanks to loopholes such as the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation, which essentially allows companies to self-determine whether a new ingredient is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to protein. By these criteria, Vital Pursuit pepperoni cauliflower crust protein pizza—and many of its fellow protein-packed processed foods—is simply a newer member of an older food category, one that is simultaneously “health food” and junk. Nestlé’s strategy seems based on the bet that consumers won’t see the contradiction here—and if they do, habit and nostalgia will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nestlé isn’t the only company that is trying to enter the protein-conscious era, nor is it the first. The protein-pumping trend appeared in nutrition and workout circles for years before weight loss drugs and MAHA took it fully mainstream. Core Power protein shakes, owned by Fairlife and distributed by Coca-Cola, launched in 2012 and in recent years has &lt;a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2023/05/06/fairlife-refuses-to-inflate-prices/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20very%20popular,at%20retailers%20across%20the%20country"&gt;inspired a mania&lt;/a&gt; reminiscent of the COVID toilet paper hoarding days. Predictably, Fairlife’s viral fame led to empty Costco shelves—and Fairlife is &lt;a href="https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/stories/coca-colas-fairlife-breaks-ground-on-major-production-facility-in-ny,1187#:~:text=This%20expansion%20follows%20the%20construction,growing%20demand%20for%20fairlife%20products."&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; new facilities to ramp up production, while members of weight loss drug support groups on social media continue to tout them as a “healthy” meal replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Nestlé pizzas, though, the list of ingredients on a Core Power shake includes plenty of evidence of processing. The natural sugar and fat in the milk is replaced with plant-based additives that imitate the texture and flavor of a sugary milkshake, in a way that makes the nutrition label look “healthier.” Core Power shakes use the thickening agent carrageenan to give that impression of milky creaminess, the emulsifier cellulose gel to replace fat, and cellulose gum for texture and consistency. The shakes’ sweetness comes from a mix of the “natural” plant-based sweeteners Stevia and monkfruit, along with the artificial sweeteners acesulfame potassium and sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the type of protein itself in these “healthy” products. Fairlife protein shakes use ultra-filtered milk, which is processed to increase protein content and reduce lactose, the natural sugar in dairy products. But some “healthy” products use even more highly processed, and questionable, sources of protein. One popular type of protein bar (among the infinite profusion of options) for those on weight loss drugs, according to an informal survey of posts in a Facebook support group, is made by Barebells. It’s a Swedish company that launched in 2016—and is notably not owned by a mega-food corporation—that offers the full range of imitation dessert flavors from cookie dough to caramel chocolate to key lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barebells uses a “milk protein blend” that includes calcium caseinate and whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, whey protein isolate. Behind all these terms is, again, lots of processing: Whey protein can be packaged into any flavor of protein bar one can dream of. Soy often appears on nutrition labels as an “isolate,” which is blasted with chemicals to “purify” it for easy use in all sorts of protein boosters, from pizza to those muscled-up pseudo-Pop-Tarts in checkout aisles from GNC to CVS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, a food company adding protein to a nutritionally empty product is better than nothing. But despite what the protein craze suggests, pumped-up protein does not put consumers on the fast-track to health. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;nutritionists&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly warning that overloading on protein can backfire: The body can only make use of a certain amount of protein for energy before the body starts storing it as fat, and overdoses of certain amino acids, which combine to form proteins, can &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/protein-food-industry-trend-nutrition-8a2cf27b?st=v91RFw"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to cardiovascular disease. And for weight-loss drug users, the drugs’ appetite-suppressing effects actually mean that consuming a variety of foods matters even more in order to get necessary nutrients with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching nutrients to cut calorie, carb, and fat counts doesn’t seem to magically create healthy food, despite food companies’ claims to the contrary. But when criticisms arise, the ultra-processed food industry’s go-to tactic consists of “reformulation”: changing recipes by using different materials such as starches or flavorings to provide the “same great taste!” W.K. Kellogg Co. followed this strategy after the U.K.’s High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) regulations went into effect in 2022, placing limits on how and where foods high in these common markers of junk food could be marketed. In response, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Article/2023/06/07/kellogg-s-expands-non-hfss-coco-pops-range#"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; an additional, “non-HFSS” version of its most popular offering among children, Coco Pops, with marginally lower sugar content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode shows that regulation can certainly be done. But it can also blur the already gray line between what’s healthy and what’s not. After all, the non-HFSS Coco Pops are by law a healthy choice now—something even the most ambitious cereal marketer would have had a hard time convincing even the most persuadable mother about before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with Kennedy asking food companies to make a “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-applauds-dairy-industry-voluntary-commitment-food-dyes.html"&gt;voluntary, protective pledge&lt;/a&gt;” to remove additives such as food dyes from their products, this dynamic could well play out in the United States, in ways that could blur the lines of healthy food even more—and reinforce old habits. After all, no matter how many people are on Ozempic, Americans aren’t going to stop eating nachos during the Super Bowl. Food marketers know well the power of nostalgia in determining what consumers will crave: The Coco Pops you ate for breakfast or the Doritos you ate while watching football as a kid might be what you crave now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the magic of modern food processing is that both cereal and chips can be adapted, at least on their face, to nutritional requirements. This ambiguity favors large food companies, which have far greater resources to make over their established brands than an organic farmer does. And that’s not even counting the time it takes for scientists and regulators to catch up. Travis Masterson, who directs the Health, Ingestive Behavior, and Technology lab at Penn State, described watching Nestlé and other food companies respond to the rise of the new weight loss drugs from inside the scientific community: “Those companies are doing massive amounts of market research on their consumers all the time,” he said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“If as scientists we're starting to look at the changes in diet, they're light years ahead of us on that because they can do things faster and easier than we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Kennedy may be behind the times in the fight to Make America Healthy Again through &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf"&gt;cutting ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. In the age of Ozempic and MAHA, the centrality of ultra-processed food to Americans’ diet seems less under threat than undergoing a new stage of evolution—a protein-packed one. We say we want to eat better, but what we really want is to feel better about eating. And food companies, unbridled by any powerful regulation, are primed to give us what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

The Trump ally has repeatedly warned—against all accepted scientific evidence—that COVID mRNA vaccines may be driving a “cancer signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One of the studies Malhotra and Hatfill cite is a 2025 paper by Paul Marik and Justus Hope, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Independent Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, titled ‘&lt;a href="https://discovery.researcher.life/article/covid-19-mrna-induced-turbo-cancers/e42d11c02d623e549ed2e837f7fb9e3b" rel=""&gt;COVID-19 mRNA-Induced “Turbo Cancers.”&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, oncology and vaccine-safety experts say the review assembles anecdotes and speculative mechanisms but doesn’t produce population-level evidence that COVID mRNA vaccines cause or accelerate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, Hatfill also vigorously championed treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, despite multiple studies and the FDA saying the drug provided no meaningful clinical benefit and could actually cause people harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="A close-up of former Army Scientist Steven Hatfill speaking to reporters in 2011." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=800" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=274 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=400 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=768 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=1024 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=1440 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;HHS advisor Steven Hatfill has made various claims debunked by science, including that COVD vaccines could lead to cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Michael Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dalgliesh, emeritus professor of oncology at the University of London, has also publicly alleged mRNA boosters can drive rapid cancer progression. Dalgleish’s beliefs have been repeatedly debunked among the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, Malhotra told the Daily Beast that RFK Jr. and Trump—having already made the COVID mRNA vaccine available only to the medically vulnerable and over-65s—were planning to pull it off the market altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Malhotra says there are people within the Trump administration, as well as among Trump’s family, who agree with RFK Jr. that there are so-called “injuries” caused by the vaccine. Kennedy and the Trump associates do not have any medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Days after the Daily Beast revealed plans to pull the vaccine, a wave of CDC departures occurred over Kennedy’s vaccine policy. Trump then publicly called on drug companies to prove that their COVID jabs worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Daily Beast approached Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the HHS, and Dalgliesh for comment. Dalgliesh said: “[While] we do not know that Charles and Kate’s unexpected cancers were caused by the vaccines, as they both presented with benign conditions… it is highly likely.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “This individual is not a member of the Administration, and does not represent the Administration’s thinking or planning. The Daily Beast should expend its obviously limited capabilities on trying to accurately cover the people who actually can speak on behalf of the Administration.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 13:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNN2VaTGx0ZUxNWjRFckNtNnRyMlFNclM1dzNUeVRQVE5GUUo5b3FKLXZaME1yMEI2NHpWNW9qenlpeVNJeG9kSjhfdkpHX2NVS09BYWV0MXRJUTk1Y0hLOTRmN1BQalBJTlZmeW5vS0xhSWt5WTZYUm96eGVvaE9QR1U4X01qaVdoX3FpckNiS29YZEJDZi0xZURmWmUxQ0ZnbnRSSUh3RGZnNUp5U05PM0xONnR3OGlTQU8xZmFDb0x2VW41V3F6cFZxaXAyQ204dG9B</guid></item><item><title>一位母亲知道她的孩子频繁的感染是不正常的。这种罕见的诊断是毁灭性的。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malignant-rhabdoid-tumor-massachusetts-general-hospital-pediatric-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jonny Terrell was a healthy, happy baby — but a month before his first birthday, he came down with an infection. Days later, he was vomiting. Over the next few weeks, mom Emily Robichau took him to the doctor for ear infections, stomachaches, rashes, vomiting, diarrhea and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The list was so long I couldn't remember it all," Robichau recalled. She had three older children and knew that kids got sick. But she had never seen anything like the constant stream of ailments her 11-month-old was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after Jonny's first birthday, in August 2024, his stomach swelled, "like watching a balloon fully inflate," Robichau said. The next day was his one-year checkup. Jonny's pediatrician took one look at him and sent them to Massachusetts General Hospital for Children. When Robichau and Jonny arrived, the toddler underwent CT and MRI scans that found a mass "about the size of a grapefruit" in his liver. A biopsy of the mass found that he had a rare and aggressive cancer called malignant rhabdoid tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she and her fiancé, Michael Terrell, began "looking at urns" as they learned more about the condition.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctors were telling me the statistics and how bad they were, and to hope for the best, but kind of prepare for the worst," Robichau recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is malignant rhabdoid tumor? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumor is a rare tumor, most often seen in infants and toddlers, said Dr. Michael Ortiz, a pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the clinical director of the rare tumors program at MSK Kids, the center's pediatric arm. Ortiz was not involved in Jonny's care. Just 20 to 25 patients are diagnosed with the illness each year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/malignant-rhabdoid-tumor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Boston Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumors can "show up anywhere" in the body's soft tissues, but "have a predilection for the brain and kidney," Ortiz said. The tumors also have a "high propensity to metastasize," or spread, throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumors are "one of the worst prognostic tumors we have in pediatrics," Ortiz said. Only about one in 10 children with the diagnosis will be cured, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating malignant rhabdoid tumor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Jonny, his case was a rare example where the tumor had not spread, said Dr. Lauren Boal, a pediatric oncologist and hematologist at Massachusetts General. She and Dr. Danielle Cameron, a pediatric surgeon with a focus on tumors like this, developed a complex treatment plan for Jonny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease really doesn't have an absolute regimen. You have to carve out an individualized plan," Boal said. For Jonny, that meant a course of six chemotherapy agents. He responded well, though he suffered unpleasant side effects from the powerful medications, Boal said, and needed a feeding tube to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, Robichau and Jonny lived in housing across the street from the hospital. It was stressful to live apart from the rest of the family, but Jonny's rigid treatment plan and its side effects made it necessary to stay close. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We all experienced the same trauma in different ways," Robichau said. "I feel like I just went on autopilot. It was lonely, it was quiet. It just had us overwhelmed, anxious, scared, financially struggling, big time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once chemotherapy shrank the tumor to about half its original size, Cameron surgically removed the mass. The operation was followed by radiation treatment. Despite the difficult circumstances, Jonny was an "amazing" patient, Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have vivid memories of him just going around the unit in his little red wagon and playing, constantly laughing," Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't really take anything for granted"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now just over 2 years old, Jonny is "in remission but undergoing careful surveillance," Cameron said. He will undergo frequent scans to ensure the tumor does not return, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Often the higher and highest risk time to have a relapse of this very difficult disease is in the first year or two after you complete your chemotherapy," Boal said. "We are watching him very closely, but very hopeful that he will not have a recurrence of this." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortiz said that children who survive malignant rhabdoid tumor often see later-in-life side effects, including an increased risk for developing a second form of cancer. Jonny will also recieve IV antibiotics monthly for the next few months to keep infections from taking advantage of his compromised immune system, caused by the chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she worries for Jonny's future, but is just trying to enjoy the current moment. He had his chemotherapy port removed, and the family recently began getting rid of the medical supplies they had acquired during Jonny's treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We still live minute by minute, day by day, week by week, as much as we can soak up every moment," she said. "After that kind of experience, we don't really take anything for granted anymore." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An emotional birthday&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Robichau and Terrell, the end of August was an emotional time time. Less than a year ago, she had been told to expect the worst. But this summer, the family was able to focus on planning Jonny's second birthday party. The event overlapped with the couple's twins' birthday, and meant they could turn what had been a traumatic day into a celebratory one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It all happened around this time," Robichau said. "We had the party on the twins' birthday, because that was the day he left (for the hospital). So we want to change that a little bit." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after the party, Jonny saw Boal at Mass General Hospital to ensure the cancer was still in remission. His scans were clear, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CBS News spoke to Robichau, Jonny could be heard chattering in the background. Terrell said he was "running around like nothing happened." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's becoming more and more real," Robichau said. "It's been a long, long year. We're just transitioning to our new normal." &lt;/p&gt;

Now, though, some people infected with COVID in China &lt;a href="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are reporting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;are reporting&lt;/a&gt; a very sore throat that’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; trends data, people throughout the U.S. are now, too, worried about this scary-sounding symptom and are searching for things like “new covid variant painful symptom” and “covid razor throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how worried do you need to be about a super-painful sore throat during a COVID infection? Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said. Doctors recommend getting the COVID shot to prevent severe disease, particularly if you’re 65 or older or have an underlying medical condition. The eligibility of who can get this year’s vaccine and the availability of the shot is currently murky, so check your state health department’s current requirements and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

They’re trying to get vaccinated ahead of a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe we can’t get” the vaccine, D’Amico said in an interview. “I’ve been inoculated a number of times and never had to get a prescription. And it’s just very frustrating that this is where we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not alone in his exasperation. Under the leadership of the vaccine skeptic Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal agencies have effectively made it more difficult to get vaccinated against COVID-19 this year. The Food and Drug Administration has only “approved” COVID-19 vaccines for those age 65 and up, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means across the country, people younger than 65 interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine must now either consult with a healthcare provider or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying health condition. It’s a potential hurdle that can make getting the vaccine more difficult and, some health experts worry, prompt even more Americans to eschew getting vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As D’Amico can attest, though, being part of a group for whom the COVID vaccine is “approved” doesn’t necessarily guarantee easy access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me to go to my primary [healthcare provider] now and get a prescription, it’s just kind of ridiculous,” D’Amico said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least some people younger than 65 are encountering pharmacy staff asking probing questions about their medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That happened Friday at a CVS in Orange County, according to 34-year-old Alex Benson, who takes medication that can suppress his immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides just protecting himself, he wanted to get vaccinated as he has family members who are at high risk should they get COVID — his mother is immunocompromised, and his mother-in-law had open-heart surgery on Thursday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson said an employee asked why he thought he was eligible for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They asked me for either a prescription or they wanted to know ... why I felt I needed the vaccination,” Benson said. At one point, a staffer offered to call his doctor to get an authorization for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson said he was alarmed by the questions, and started to “feel kind of some desperation to plead my case to the pharmacist.” Another CVS staffer later came over and said further answers weren’t necessary and simply attesting he was eligible was good enough. He eventually got the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he felt the experience was dismaying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think easy access should be the policy,” Benson said. “I tend not to get too political, but it seems just rather juxtaposed to me that an anti-regulation administration is using regulation in this way. They’re supposed to be removing barriers to healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine chaos comes as COVID-19 is either increasing or starting to hit its late summer peak. According to data released Friday, there are now 14 states with “very high” levels of coronavirus detected in their wastewater — California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Connecticut, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said data continue to show an increase in coronavirus cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over this past week, we’ve seen an increase in the number of outpatient COVID cases, and even a smattering of inpatient cases,” Hudson said. “It appears that we may be nearing the top of the wave, but it may be another two weeks or so until we truly know if we’re there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus lab tests are confirming infection also continues to rise statewide and in the Los Angeles area. For the week ending Aug. 30, California’s COVID test positivity rate was 12.83%, up from 7.05% for the week ending Aug. 2. In L.A. County, the positive test rate was 14.83%, up from 9.33%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data, however, suggest some areas may have reached their summer COVID peak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, the COVID positive test rate was 13.1%. That’s below the prior week’s rate of 18%, but still higher than the rate for the week that ended Aug. 2, which was 10.8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, the test positivity rate has been hovering around 9% for the last week of reliable data available. It’s up from 7% a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, wastewater data in L.A. County show coronavirus levels declined slightly from the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s too early to know if this decrease in wastewater viral concentrations is the first sign that COVID-19 activity is peaking or is regular variation typical of this data source,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID hospital admissions in California are increasing — with the latest rate of 3.93 admissions per 100,000 residents, up from 2.38. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they remain relatively low statewide and in L.A. County. The number of L.A. County residents seeking care for COVID-related illness, or who have been hospitalized, “is quite a bit lower than during summer surges in 2023 and 2024,” the public health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relatively mild summer wave, however, could mean that the annual fall-and-winter COVID wave might be stronger. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/covid-rising-in-california-how-bad-will-this-summer-be"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the state Department of Public Health said that scientists anticipate California would see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current confusion over federal COVID vaccine policy has been exacerbated by the chaos at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where Kennedy earlier this year fired everyone on the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and orchestrated the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez just 29 days after she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Kennedy’s handpicked replacements on the ACIP have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. And the new interim CDC director — Jim O’Neill, a Kennedy deputy — is a &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/jim-oneill-cdc-kennedy-trump-vaccines-58fd24f678bf46ea6ec96a2b09f85ff4" target="_blank"&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt; of health regulations and has no training in medicine or healthcare, the AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC hasn’t issued its own recommendations on who should get vaccinated, and that inaction has resulted in residents of a number of states needing to get prescriptions from a healthcare provider for at least the next couple of weeks. In some cases, that’s true even for seniors, as D’Amico found out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, CVS said people need a prescription to get a COVID-19 vaccine, sometimes depending on their age, in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS couldn’t even offer the COVID-19 at its pharmacies in Nevada as of Friday; they were only available at the company’s MinuteClinic sites, according to spokesperson Amy Thibault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS said it expects to offer COVID-19 vaccines without prescriptions at its pharmacies in New Mexico, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania “soon,” due to recent regulatory changes in each state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, all patients in all states need to attest to being eligible for the vaccine in order to schedule an appointment online,” Thibault said. If an adult says they have no underlying health conditions, but do have a prescription from a healthcare provider for “off-label” use of the vaccine, they can get the shot, Thibault confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Hawaii joined California, Washington and Oregon in launching the West Coast Health Alliance: an interstate compact meant to provide science-based immunization guidance as an alternative to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these states will provide evidence-based immunization guidance rooted in safety, efficacy, and transparency — ensuring residents receive credible information free from political interference,” according to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/04/hawaii-to-join-west-coast-health-alliance-with-california-oregon-and-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement suggested that the Trump administration was essentially “dismantling” the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The absence of consistent, science-based federal leadership poses a direct threat to our nation’s health security,” the statement said. “To protect the health of our communities, the West Coast Health Alliance will continue to ensure that our public health strategies are based on best available science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear, however, whether the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance  would make it easier for people to get COVID-19 vaccines at the nation’s largest pharmacy retailers, where many people get their shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical groups, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, are also offering their own recommendations to advise individuals and families on what vaccines they should get. &lt;/p&gt;

Importantly, eating breakfast later with aging was linked to a higher risk of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status,” lead author &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/14405948/Hassan-Dashti" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a senior couple eating breakfast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity,” senior author Dr. Altug Didikoglu, MSc, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey, said in the statement. “Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,’ especially for older individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/eating-breakfast-later-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-11804603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 04:25:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE02TXVESzlxQVYwRU4xOWwzWTYwdG1zZGNNNW9qSnNfcHBtcTVDZjJNdk1RMk53RTFOYUdwNnZ4R0RFeUl2MVlSQ2pPeFNPZWo4aWRkLUdIcmR4R25hZDlDeDJyOWctZHhPWE5SN2ZEZFpZU09KVTNSbg</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心表示，与代谢膳食有关的沙门氏菌爆发使十几人患病， 7人住院治疗-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salmonella-outbreak-metabolic-meals-cdc/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-0" data-index="0" data-path="/news/salmonella-outbreak-metabolic-meals-cdc/" class="content content-article lazyload"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metabolic Meals is a home delivery meal subscription service focused on macro-friendly meals, &lt;a href="https://mymetabolicmeals.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to their website. CBS News has reached out to Metabolic Meals for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC advised people to check their refrigerator or freezer for any affected products and do not eat them; throw them away or contact the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic Meals is working with investigators and has "reached out to customers directly who purchased the meal types listed above to inform them of the outbreak," the CDC said in their statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health officials said about 16 people reported symptoms and seven were hospitalized, but officials cautioned the number of people affected might be higher, as it usually takes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/reporting-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;3 to 4 weeks&lt;/a&gt; to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A western Minnesota woman is speaking out about her life-changing experience with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-west-nile-virus-cases-2025/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; amid a rise in reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarissa Sparkl, 37, of Montevideo, experienced a case so severe that she now stays in an assisted living facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you get West Nile, there is nothing you can do about it. It takes a week to diagnose it," Lori Winterfeld, Sparkl's mom, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's how long it took to diagnose Sparkl's condition. By that time, her health had taken a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She got sick on a Friday, and by Monday she was hospitalized and intubated," Winterfeld said. "The only thing she could move initially were her eyebrows. And then she could eventually blink. It's been a long, long haul."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparkl added, "I didn't know what happened because I was young and healthy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Her family believes she may have been bitten by a mosquito carrying West Nile in her own backyard. She also takes medication for multiple sclerosis, which Winterfeld thinks may have made it harder to fight off the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One percent of the cases of West Nile are neuroinvasive, and hers hit her brain stem," Winterfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparkl became so weak that last year, she was forced to leave her husband, Jesse, and 10-year-old daughter behind, and move into a nursing facility in St. Paul. That's where Winterfeld takes care of her during the week, and Jesse drives from Montevideo to be with her on the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, some movement has returned to her arms and her hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal now is to get Sparkl off her breathing tube, and once that happens, she can go home. Her family is hoping that it can happen by November.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really hard because I love my daughter," Sparkl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winterfeld added, "It's been hard on her, too, not having a mom at home. Video chat is wonderful. She gets to see her mom every day, and she gets to talk to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a homecoming on the horizon, the fight against the virus will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a bad year for West Nile. In every state, it was very early," Winterfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she got sick, Sparkl worked as a social worker, a teacher and a pharmacy technician. A GoFundMe page has been set up in her name to help pay for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a while
since we’ve had a COVID update, eh, readers? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, with the
virus going around lately, and with changes in who is eligible for
vaccine boosters (big changes? or maybe not?), we figured it was time
to check back in with Dr. Candy Stockton, our county health officer,
who was kind enough to catch the &lt;i&gt;Outpost&lt;/i&gt;
up earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up: You’ve
probably noticed that the ’rona has been going around lately. Dr.
Stockton said that although the county’s Public Health Division no
longer tracks raw case numbers like it did in the bad old days of the
pandemic, it has definitely noticed that the virus is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Stockton
says, Humboldt County seems to be falling into a coronavirus pattern.
We usually get a smallish spike in the late summer – now – and a
larger spike in January and February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, the spike
this summer is smaller than last summer’s spike, which is good, but
it’s very definitely impacting people,” Stockton told us. “People
are missing work. Kids are missing school. It’s impacting our
hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one
Humboldt County person has died of the virus in the last month,
Stockton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/116915"&gt;newish
variant of the virus going around&lt;/a&gt;, one they’re calling the
“XFG” or “Stratus” variant that seems to be quickly on the
rise in the United States, and which is garnering some news
attention. But Stockton is of the same opinion as the people quoted
at the link in the last sentence: From the public’s perspective,
there really isn’t much concerning about XFG. It’s not a
particularly nasty version of the bug, and current vaccines should be
effective against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of
vaccines: This year’s crop of booster shots has been approved by
the FDA, and vials should be reaching Humboldt County outlets within
the next few days or weeks. But you’ve no doubt read about the
Centers for Disease Control’s new guidelines about who should be
receiving the shots – people 65 or older, or those with serious
preexisting conditions. What does that mean for people under 65, or
those who may or may not have those conditions? Can you still get
your shot if you want them, even if you don’t meet those criteria?
And where can you get it? And will your insurance pay for it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that
still not quite clear about all of this, but Stockton, right now, is
that the coming year is actually not going to be all that different
from years previous. She’s pretty certain that as in years past,
pretty much the only thing you’ll need to get a COVID shot is the
desire to have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the major
pharmacy chains are waiting for a little bit more clarity and
guidance from the states that they work in before they make that
final determination,” she said. “But we do think that, yes,
people probably will be able to walk into the pharmacy, let the
pharmacist know that they’re at high risk or they live with somebody
who’s at high risk, and be able to get the vaccine. And that’s what
we’re working towards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, New York
Governor Kathy Hochul &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;signed
an executive order&lt;/a&gt; allowing that state’s pharmacists to
administer the shot. California, Oregon and Washington – the states
that make up the new “&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/california-oregon-washington-form-health-alliance-amid-federal-vaccine-tensions-2025-09-03/"&gt;West
Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;” – will probably do something similar,
if they need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Stockton
said, insurance companies have signaled that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-insurers-likely-cover-updated-covid-shots-this-year-industry-sources-say-2025-08-28/"&gt;they
are willing to pay for shots&lt;/a&gt;, as they have in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[It] makes a lot
of sense because vaccines are a relatively inexpensive, very
cost-effective way to reduce medical costs,” Stockton said. “So
if you’re an insurer and you choose not to pay for a vaccine that can
say, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospitalization
costs, it doesn’t take very long before you’re losing more money than
you’re actually saving by not paying for the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So despite
high-profile announcements coming from the Trump Administration,
Stockton and others are fairly confident that nothing much is set to
change in the short-term. Vaccines will be available in time for that
big spike that the county’s expecting in the winter, and right now
Stockton believes that if you want one, you will be able to get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Stockton –
coming at it from a public health perspective – very much hopes
that you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While I
understand every person ultimately needs to make that decision for
themselves, I do want to remind all of your readers that our
healthcare resources — our hospital capacity, emergency room
capacity — we’re stretched really thin as a county right now,” she
said. “And it may not seem like a big deal if five or six people
get hospitalized one week for COVID during the winter, if you’re just
talking about numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I think most
people in this county have experienced, you know, having to go into
the emergency room. And then having to spend a really long time in
the emergency room because there are no open beds upstairs in the
hospital. And so for those people who are able and willing, they
could really help us out as a community by getting vaccinated to help
our community. If they’re willing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Lost Coast Outpost</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOcE9tTlJmZjFMUGhucmN1U1VHSlZ1UlJaeDJIT3R2WnVSRURNYTUwZjJqd2FnMnp1akhGdG1sbElhRmUwckJnRHNZNGZYWXZ0V3ZaOEF0UHktUWVtX1lpc1J6TzBrYkpoX1Z2UmFyVEhYbTFZb2l0eVB4NHhNVzFNNVM3OUpPZ1hob2o5THdPNk9qX0FvRkE</guid></item><item><title>谁可以接种新冠疫苗？如何接种？这很复杂。- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/who-can-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-how-its-complicated/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For these people, regardless of what state they are in, getting the vaccine would mean a pharmacist or doctor would have to go "off-label" to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's very gray on how a pharmacist may proceed in that scenario," Groves told Ars. Going off-label could open pharmacists up to liability concerns, she said. And even if a patient can obtain a prescription for an off-label vaccine, that still may not be enough to allow a pharmacist to administer the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pharmacists have something called 'corresponding responsibility,' Groves explained. "So even if a physician, or a nurse practitioner, or whomever may send a prescription over for that vaccine, that pharmacist still has that responsibility to ensure this is the right medication, for the right patient, at the right time, and that they're indicated for it," she said. So, it would still be going outside what they're technically authorized to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors, on the other hand, can administer vaccines off-label, which they might do if they choose to follow guidance from medical organizations like AAP and ACOG, or if they think it's best for their patient. They can do this without any heightened professional liability, contrary to some suggestions Kennedy has made (doctors prescribe things off-label all the time). But, people may have to schedule an appointment with their doctor and convince them to provide the shot—a situation far less convenient than strolling into a local pharmacy. Also, since pharmacies have provided the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines so far, some doctors' offices may not have them on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if pregnancy still falls under the FDA's criteria for a high-risk condition. It was included in the list that FDA officials published in May. However, the agency did not make that list official when it changed the vaccine labels last month. Some experts have suggested that, in this case, the qualifying high-risk conditions default to the CDC's existing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;list of high-risk conditions&lt;/a&gt;, which includes pregnancy. But it's not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week Dr Xand van Tulleken, the public health specialist and broadcaster, expressed concern about the “massively confusing” array of health supplements being pushed as daily&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; essentials by influencers on social media. “They are a perfect product to sell: massive profit margins, long shelf lives, they’re light and easy to ship … people never return them, the regulations are light,” he told Radio 4’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today &lt;/i&gt;programme. And while some people might benefit from taking certain supplements for certain periods of time, they don’t all work for everyone. “Do not get your health advice from Instagram and don’t get your health advice from anyone who is selling you the product that they’re trying to persuade you is healthy,” Van Tulleken added. “The NHS has some pretty good guidelines on which people might want to consider supplementation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So what — if anything — should you be taking? If in doubt, speak to a GP or pharmacist before taking a pill or powder, especially if you are on other medication or have underlying health conditions. Here, with the help of nutrition experts, we look at what adults need to know before buying any of the popular pills:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Essential for maintaining the health of bones, teeth, muscles and immune function, vitamin D also enables the body to absorb the teeth and bone-building nutrients calcium and phosphorus. “It plays a key role in preventing the systemic inflammation that is linked to many chronic diseases,” says Dr Linia Patel, a researcher in the department of clinical sciences and community health at the Universita degli Studi di Milano in Italy and a spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association (BDA). Food is not the best source — only small amounts are found in dairy products, oily fish, cod liver oil, milk and eggs — and most vitamin D comes from exposure to sunshine for 15 minutes a day between April and September (30 minutes if you have darker skin). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A deficiency may affect the health of bones, teeth and muscles and government figures suggest that “one in six adults in the UK have low levels”. A study in the BMJ involving 449,943 adults concluded that “taking supplements was associated with a lower risk of vitamin D deficiency”. “Research also links a deficiency with impaired immune function,” says the dietician Bahee Van de Bor, a spokeswoman for the BDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yes, everyone should take a supplement of 10mcg a day from the end of September until April, according to the NHS. All children aged 1 to 4, all babies (unless taking more than 500ml of fortified formula milk) and anyone at risk of low levels (the over-65s, the housebound or those working indoors and people with darker skin) should take a supplement all year round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-d-supplements-ageing-cch2j258r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin D supplements could counter ageing, study suggests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Creatine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Popular with gymgoers looking for muscle definition and speedy recovery from exercise, creatine is a compound produced naturally in the body. It is present in red meat and seafood and plays an important role in cell regulation and in the regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the compound that provides cells with the energy they need to function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Creatine is one of the most widely studied of all fitness and health supplements because it is so popular. A paper in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition confirmed it boosts exercise performance and helps with injury prevention and recovery. Others take it to boost brain health, although last year the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) rejected claims that creatine may improve cognitive function. Although with more studies emerging, such as a paper in Nature journal that found a single dose of creatine boosted cognition in sleep-deprived people, we should probably watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sporty types and the over-65s might want to try it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/creatine-supplement-muscles-memory-experience-advice-7gmsvllmz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is creatine the secret weapon for midlife women?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Lion’s mane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The lion’s mane mushroom grows on old tree trunks and contains the compounds hericenones and erinacines, which are believed to boost brain health and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study in the journal Antioxidants showed hericenones and erinacines might help to enhance the growth of brain cells. But many of the studies have been small and on animals.

Magnesium activates important enzymes in the body and is involved in the secretion of hormones needed for bone metabolism. It is a popular sleep aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some researchers, including the authors of a paper in Complementary Medicine and Therapies, have shown that a magnesium deficiency disrupts nerve signalling, which changes levels of sleep-inducing hormones such as melatonin in the body. Men aged 15 and older and girls aged 15-18 need 300mg magnesium per day; women aged 19 plus need 270mg daily. Unless you have been diagnosed with a deficiency, the NHS says we should be able to get all of the magnesium we need from foods including nuts and seeds, leafy greens, pulses, yoghurt and fish. It is unlikely to improve your sleep if you get enough magnesium in your diet anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It’s very hard to overdose on magnesium as it has laxative effects if you have the dosage wrong so will pass through the body,” Patel says. “I tell my patients to try 300mg for 12 weeks and see if you notice a difference.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Probiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These are supplements of beneficial bacteria that help to create balance in our microbiome, the vast ecosystem of bacteria, fungi and yeasts that inhabit our intestines, and might enhance your health, immunity and mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There is plenty of evidence that some probiotics are helpful, but you do need to choose the right type. According to Dr Gemma Walton, a researcher at the University of Reading’s Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, products with lots of evidence sit on shelves next to probiotics that have very little research behind them. Not all bacteria strains in probiotics have the same effects and supplements should be selected according to symptoms or requirements. Walton and a team of nutrition scientists from the University of Reading, the University of Leeds, King’s College London and the US and Canada-based Alliance for Education in Probiotics have compiled a comprehensive guide to science backed probiotic supplements at probioticguide.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking them? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly, although consult your GP or &lt;a href="http://www.probioticguide.uk" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;probioticguide.uk&lt;/a&gt; for effective products that meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/gut-health-guide-best-probiotics-app-apple-android-vm65v653q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The experts’ guide to the probiotics that work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Important in supporting immune function, vitamin C also helps the body to produce collagen needed for the healing and maintenance of healthy skin. It is needed to keep blood vessels, bones and cartilage healthy and to help the body absorb iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Vitamin C is water soluble, meaning excess levels are excreted in urine, not stored in the body, so we all need a regular intake. Current NHS recommendations state that anyone aged 15 and older needs 40mg a day; under-15s need 30-35mg daily. Taking extra in supplement form won’t prevent a cold but might cut it short by up to 1.5 days, according to a 2023 review of ten published studies by scientists at the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are not a big fruit and veg eater, or if you are a smoker (it destroys vitamin C in the body), you might consider a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-c-anyone-the-truth-about-immunity-boosters-gnkhlds2c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin C, anyone?

It is said to reduce stress and anxiety by lowering levels of hormones such as cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One review of 12 clinical trials involving 1,002 people aged 25 to 48 published in the journal Phytotherapy Research found that 300-600mg a day “significantly reduced anxiety”. However, many of the purported benefits for ashwagandha such as better sleep, improved energy levels and concentration are anecdotal or based on very small studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;No. The UK Food Standards Agency is reviewing evidence and last year said that it was “aware there are potential risks to health from consuming ashwagandha in food supplements” such as possible effects on thyroid function and liver toxicity. In 2024 the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment warned it may not be safe for children, pregnant women and people with liver conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="2.47"&gt;&lt;div id="26a1728e-fa37-4698-a72d-03cf8c4c6615"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Collagen is usually combined with vitamin C, found in orange juice, for better absorption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Collagen is our body’s structural protein — the scaffolding that glues together tissues like bones, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and skin. Supplements of it are derived from animal sources, such as beef or fish, and usually combined with vitamin C for better absorption. People take it for strong muscles and tendons but also — like the many celebrities extolling its virtues on Instagram — for more radiant, plump skin and bouncy hair and healthy nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It has been shown in small studies from Liverpool John Moores University and University College London to improve tendon and muscular health in elite athletes. But a review of 23 clinical trials with 1,474 participants that looked at the effects of collagen on improving skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles for a study published this month in the American Journal of Medicine concluded: “There is currently no clinical evidence to support the use of collagen supplements to prevent or treat skin ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Probably not. Only worth considering if you are an injury-prone professional footballer or Olympian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/health-products-dont-need-health-trends-supplements-ckppsdd9v" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 health products you don’t need — from sports drinks to collagen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The active ingredient in the blazing yellow spice turmeric is curcumin, which has proven anti-inflammatory properties. It is often taken as a remedy for everything from high cholesterol and hay fever to depression and aching joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The evidence supporting turmeric supplementation is mixed. A study in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine found that turmeric is as effective as omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) medicine for reducing excess stomach acid. And a combination of curcumin and piperine, an alkaloid in black pepper that has potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, was shown in the Journal of Sports Science Medicine to reduce muscle damage and soreness caused by exercise if taken before and after a workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Not enough is yet known about its effect on joints, though, and a 2017 review in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry stated that many of the purported benefits of curcumin for health issues and joint pain are “highly improbable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you exercise hard or if you suffer from stomach acid. “But find one with black pepper as it is needed for absorption of turmeric by the body,” Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Zinc is a mineral needed for the development and function of immune cells, which is why zinc supplements are a top choice for defending against winter viruses such as colds. It is also found in meat, poultry, shellfish, nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2024 Cochrane Library review revealed that “zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds”, although the authors did concede that zinc supplementation might be helpful in reducing “the duration of ongoing colds”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you are over 60 when our ability to absorb zinc declines, says Dr Jenna Macciochi, a senior lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex and author of &lt;i&gt;Immune to Age&lt;/i&gt;. “Short-term small doses of 10-40mg of zinc supplements or lozenges taken over a few days could be helpful if you have cold symptoms,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Glucosamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A compound used by the body to make the chemicals needed to build strong muscles, tendons and cartilage, glucosamine is among the most popular supplements taken to relieve and prevent knee and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A review of studies involving 4,000 people in archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery reported that glucosamine supplements had little or no effect on relieving osteoarthritis knee pain. And the EFSA says it won’t help to maintain healthy joint cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;No. Don’t waste your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Needed for healthy blood and nerve function. “Vitamin B12 also helps to break down homocysteine, a protein that is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and strokes,” says Rhiannon Lambert, a registered nutritionist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Unprocessed Plate&lt;/i&gt;. “It is found in animal products such as meat, fish, dairy and eggs, but plant-based sources don’t exist.” Fortified foods such as some breakfast cereals and plant milks are another source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although the body is able to store some B12, there is an increased risk of nerve problems if levels are low. Symptoms of low intakes include fatigue, muscle pains, poor memory and reduced cognitive function. In February 2025 researchers from the University of California reported in the Annals of Neurology that older people with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, displayed signs of cognitive decline. “Clinicians should consider [B12] supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yes, if you are vegan, vegetarian or follow a strict plant-based diet. Possibly if you are over 60 with symptoms of a low intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/three-ways-to-avoid-b12-deficiency-0xdptlnm0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three ways to avoid B12 deficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Iron is needed for our energy supplies. It plays a role in many metabolic processes including breathing, DNA synthesis and immune function and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Men need 8.7mg daily; women aged 11-50 need 14.8mg and all over-50s need 8.7mg daily, which is easily obtainable in the diet from meat and fish, beans, pulses and leafy green vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, estimates that 3 per cent of men and 8 per cent of women have iron-deficiency anaemia, resulting in tiredness and weakness, with 57,000 emergency admissions to hospital each year due to the condition. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that found about 25 per cent of healthy adults in their seventies and older developed iron-deficiency anaemia within five years of enrolling in the study. Taking a low-dose daily aspirin (sometimes recommended by the NHS to prevent blood clots from forming in arteries of people at higher risk of heart disease) increased the risk by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you are a woman with heavy menstrual bleeding or are pregnant or have an iron deficiency diagnosed by a blood test. “Children who are picky eaters may also need a supplement,” Van de Bor says. Multivitamins often contain at least 100 per cent of the daily requirement or about 14mg whereas iron-only supplements typically contain 15-20mg. Make sure you don’t take both. Taking extra iron if you are not lacking it in the diet can be toxic, says the NHS, and iron supplements should always be kept away from children for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Psyllium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sometimes billed as a cheaper alternative to weight loss jabs, psyllium, or ispaghula, husk is derived from the mainly soluble fibre outer shell of the &lt;i&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/i&gt; plant. It contains a compound called arabinoxylan, which forms a gel when it comes into contact with water in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The effects of supplementation are well researched with studies showing it may help to lower our cholesterol by converting cholesterol into bile acids, dampen blood sugar spikes and reduce inflammation. It’s also a prebiotic — providing food for beneficial bacteria in the gut. And the NHS says it helps to bulk up poo to treat constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Only if you have constipation.

Omega-3 essential fatty acids include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is needed for your body to make eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Both are important for healthy blood vessels, heart and immune system. These omega-3 fatty acids cannot be made in the body and need to be consumed in our diets. Good food sources are oily fish (mackerel, herring, sardines) and nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This year a British Journal of Nutrition paper suggested that high-dose fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids had greater cardio-protective effects than eating oily fish alone. However, last year a BMJ study showed that omega-3 supplements might help in stalling the progression of heart disease in those who already have it but might increase the risk of others developing a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The British Heart Foundation says you do not need to take omega-3 supplements unless told to do so by a doctor, but that if you are not a fish eater, you might consider a capsule. Look for one that provides about 450mg a day of DHA and EPA omega-3s, the foundation suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Multivitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A comprehensive multivitamin will contain vitamins, minerals and sometimes other nutrients that may be difficult to get in restrictive or low-calorie diets. Different products will have a different mix of nutrients so look for one with a wide range of vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A BMJ study of over 20,000 people showed that taking a multivitamin offered no greater protection against health conditions than not taking one. However, it might be worthwhile for people over 60. After studies on 5,000 adults aged 60-plus, JoAnn Manson, head of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition last year that a daily multivitamin helped to slow cognitive ageing. More recently, Manson told the American Heart Association conference that multivitamins slowed biological ageing by between 10 and 20 per cent in people who took them daily for two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Worth trying if you have a poor diet or are in your sixties or older, when our bodies become less efficient at absorbing some vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQTDlTeldpZEhUZDJWLWtOTlhjYjJSbk5oZUpIVmMzb2JYbFZTY0xvRi1hTDJoQnhScjB3VkhXR0NKbkx4OE9FTEt4d0JwZmVWa1cwQi1rWjROWjBwd19BdEVRNGFueE56WWFQa3JNY1pkZV9WcFdBRDNaZUFfQjgxdlJVb2hLeUJHcEVwMmF3WDZmU1JGbHNtbXNCa1dTWjhlVDBVOQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心在十几份送货上门餐点可能感染沙门氏菌后发出警报- WSB-TV</title><link>https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/cdc-puts-out-alert-after-more-than-dozen-get-salmonella-likely-home-delivery-meals/KNYWBKORINBGFM4YIWCPPWTTTI/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;ATLANTA — The CDC is putting out an alert after more than a dozen people across 10 states have gotten Salmonella infections tied to home delivery meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Health officials say two people in Georgia are among the 16 people who have gotten sick from different varieties of Metabolic Meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;According to the CDC, these are the meals impacted by the health alert:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Select meals delivered during the week of July 28, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four Cheese Tortellini with Pesto Sauce and Grilled Chicken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25199&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/07/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low Carb Chicken Teriyaki and Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25202&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/05/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Garlic &amp;amp; Ranch Chicken Tenders with Roasted Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25205&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/08/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sliced Top Sirloin with Roasted Peanut Sauce and Summer Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25203&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/06/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional meal lot codes include: 25199, 25202, 25203, 25204, 25205&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;The CDC says if you have any of these meals, to throw them out or contact the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Most people who get sick from Salmonella usually experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRENDING STORIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms will start anywhere from six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria.

In some instances, the bacteria enters the body through open wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, seven cases have been confirmed in Florida Panhandle waters. Three of those cases were contracted in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Gallagher says she wishes she had known the risks before jumping in the water. She says she almost lost her leg and her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is still fighting off the infection. She says she never would have gotten vibrio if government officials took certain precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher is the newest victim in a string of vibrio vulnificus infections in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I would have had heard of vibrio, yes, I would have been like, 'I'm not getting in that water at all,'" said Gallagher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, her husband and seven-year-old daughter went swimming in Santa Rosa Sound in late July. Less than a week later, she was rushed into surgery, diagnosed with a vibrio infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was intubated for about six days and finally woke up and saw that I had a leg that didn't even look like my own leg anymore," Gallagher said. "Because they had to clean away so much of that flesh-eating bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county currently doesn't do routine testing for vibrio in the water. Environmental specialist Sava Varazo says that needs to change. He says the bacteria can be detected with a quick, inexpensive litmus test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good, reliable," Varazo said. "It's a high reliability test. It's simple to implement the results... You can get those results very quick sometimes in less than 30 to 40 minutes, so it's a quick, reliable test. It's much better than what we have now, which is nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we were to test for vibrio, we would find vibrio in every sample that we tested," Escambia County's senior scientist Chips Kirschenfeld said. "The problem is there's really nothing we can do as far as best management practices or any kind of upland treatment to reduce those numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you really think about the number of people who get infected in the water, the numbers are really quite low," he said. "You know, here in the Escambia County, we have an average of five infections per year. We have a million people that go to Pensacola Beach every year and five people get infections. That's 0.0005% chance of getting a vibrio infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirschenfeld says this about the choice for the county to do routine vibrio testing, or post educational signage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That, that's certainly a political decision," said Kirschenfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Gallagher, the answer is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said there needs to be signs out there stating there is flesh-heating bacteria to be known to be in this water, or they need to have those signs and they need to have testing done during the summertime saying levels are high, levels are low, whatever," Gallagher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since she contracted vibrio, Gallagher has had multiple surgeries in various hospitals around the state. Her family has started &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/genevieves-fight-against-vibrio" target="_blank" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/genevieves-fight-against-vibrio" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;a GoFundMe to help with the costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WEAR-TV</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:14:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNenhYS25ibTUxdHFXMUxFVEFkQkhoWklZMFZMT3c0dHRFZFdiX0xDRXI0MC1iU2lPR1BjbTA3dWFqRmd1SllOUzM0SjJDa3gzZGhydHVESkdUb01UR2tyTGszYmNSYThvMEVhZGhwNEVtZXNTc1ByMVNCa3VwdEd4dUJ6SXNiQXMyRDI0aEdZMWl2RGtDWXFKRkFfTQ</guid></item><item><title>在领养活动中被忽视的小猫不知道这是因为它们“与众不同” -渡渡鸟</title><link>https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/kittens-ignored-at-adoption-event-dont-know-its-because-theyre-different</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="NodeArticlestyles__ObscuredContentWrapper-sc-1rwhog1-6 eCcsQv"&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="0"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.nawsus.org/"&gt;NAWS Humane Society of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; held a cat adoption event.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/warren-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;WARREN, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; (WKBN) — A human case of West Nile virus reported by the Trumbull County Combined Health District has been confirmed by the Ohio Department of Health, according to the District.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the first human case in Trumbull County. &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/west-farmington-news/west-nile-virus-detected-in-trumbull-county-mosquito-sample/"&gt;A sample tested positive for West Nile in Trumbull County early this month.&lt;/a&gt; The sample was collected at Hillside Cemetery in West Farmington.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquito samples have tested positive in nearby counties, including &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/grove-city-news/mercer-county-has-more-positive-west-nile-samples/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/grove-city-news/mercer-county-has-more-positive-west-nile-samples/"&gt;Mercer County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/August-2025-Press-Releases/8-18-2025-Allegheny-County-Health-Department-Identifies-1st-Human-Case-of-West-Nile-Virus-in-2025" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/August-2025-Press-Releases/8-18-2025-Allegheny-County-Health-Department-Identifies-1st-Human-Case-of-West-Nile-Virus-in-2025"&gt;Allegheny County&lt;/a&gt; reported its first human case in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, most people infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some may have mild illness with flu-like symptoms, such as fever with headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. The CDC says most people with mild illness recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a higher risk for severe illness for older adults or those with certain chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Trumbull County Combined Health District is reminding the community to stay vigilant against being bitten by mosquitoes by wearing insect repellent, wearing long sleeves or pants outside and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito biting hours. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The district also advises other precautions to prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home, such as emptying standing water from items such as flowerpots, buckets and tarps, replacing pets’ water dishes frequently and unclogging roof gutters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More information about West Nile virus can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Even more concerning, women given the drug faced higher risks of death and complications. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed to heart attack survivors as a standard treatment. But the massive REBOOT trial has revealed they provide no benefit for patients with preserved heart function — and may actually increase risks for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Standard Treatment Questioned After 40 Years&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta blockers, commonly prescribed for heart conditions including heart attacks, have now been shown to offer no measurable benefit for patients who experience an uncomplicated myocardial infarction while maintaining normal heart function. Despite being recommended for this group for four decades, their effectiveness in such cases is now being called into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding comes from the REBOOT Trial, a major study led by Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain’s Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The results, which challenge one of cardiology’s longest-standing practices, were presented on August 30, during a “Hot Line” session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid and published at the same time in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Higher Risks for Women Exposed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A companion substudy of REBOOT, released the same day in the &lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;, revealed an important difference between men and women. Women who were treated with beta blockers after a heart attack faced a higher likelihood of dying, suffering another heart attack, or being hospitalized for heart failure when compared with women who did not receive the medication. This increased risk was not observed in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai – such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI –that have already transformed some global approaches to &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;,” says Dr. Fuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_492837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-492837" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-492837" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-777x518.jpg" alt="Valentin Fuster" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-777x518.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Valentin-Fuster.jpg 1799w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-492837" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD. “REBOOT Trial” shows beta blockers—drugs commonly prescribed for heart attacks—may offer no clinical benefit for these patients. Credit: Mount Sinai Health System&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that combines three medications – which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. The DapaTAVI trial showed that both dapagliflozin and the related medication empagliflozin – drugs used to treat diabetes – improve the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Global Impact on Heart Attack Care&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide,” says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC’s Scientific Director, who presented the results. “Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. The REBOOT findings represent one of the most significant advances in heart attack treatment in decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The REBOOT trial, is the largest clinical trial on this subject. The international study was coordinated by CNIC in collaboration with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Largest Beta Blocker Study to Date&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive beta blockers after hospital discharge. All patients otherwise received the current standard of care and were followed for a median of nearly four years. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. Results show women treated with beta-blockers had a 2.7 percent higher absolute risk of mortality compared to those not treated with beta-blockers during the 3.7 years of follow-up of the study. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with completely normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why the Old Standard No Longer Fits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult,” explains Dr. Ibáñez. “Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. In this new context, where the extent of heart damage is smaller, the need for beta blockers is unclear. While we often test new drugs, it’s much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;REBOOT Trial Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the motivation behind REBOOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” Dr. Ibanez adds.&lt;/p&gt;

It found that short energy bursts – a median of just 1.1 minutes per day of brief, vigorous effort – was linked with a lower risk of death over roughly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was simple. People who racked up about five or six energy bursts per day, each usually around 10 seconds and all under one minute, tended to fare better than those who did none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was led by Emmanuel Stamatakis at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The team focused on vigorous activity, meaning effort that makes breathing hard and raises heart rate clearly for short spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at death from any cause. The curve of benefit rose quickly at low amounts, then flattened, which means the biggest change showed up when going from zero to a little. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is important for people who find it hard to schedule &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-can-slow-aging-right-down-to-your-dna/"&gt;workouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample came from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHANES&lt;/a&gt; (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), a long-running U.S. program that links health records with device-measured movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore a wrist accelerometer – a sensor that records motion dozens of times per second – for about a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors studied what they call Vigorous Intermittent Lifestyle Physical Activity (&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VILPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the short, sharp effort that happens during normal life, like a very fast walk uphill, a quick run to catch a bus, or carrying heavy items up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-short-energy-bursts-mean"&gt;What short energy bursts mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two findings stood out. First, daily time VILPA showed a near-linear link with lower risk, and the median of 1.1 minutes per day corresponded to a hazard ratio of about 0.61 in models that accounted for many other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, doing roughly five to six short bursts per day captured most of the observed benefit in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VILPA is a bit like applying the principles of High &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-feels-better-when-its-matched-to-your-personality/"&gt;Intensity&lt;/a&gt; Interval Training to your everyday life,” Stamatakis explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to further investigate this link through robust trials, but it appears that VILPA may be a promising, cost free recommendation for lowering cancer risk in people who find structured exercise difficult or unappealing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-with-other-studies"&gt;Comparing with other studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier U.K. Biobank &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; reported that a sample median of 4.4 minutes per day of VILPA was associated with noticeably lower risks of all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. study’s median dose is smaller, which may reflect differences in age, fitness, or baseline activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer findings from the U.K. Biobank add useful context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of non-exercisers found that about 4.5 minutes per day of VILPA was linked to lower incident cancer risk, with the steepest gains when moving from none to a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hazard ratio compares rates of an outcome between groups over time. Values below 1.0 indicate a lower rate in the more active group, values above 1.0 indicate a higher rate, and the confidence interval shows the range of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers do not prove that short energy bursts caused the lower risk. They show a strong association after adjusting for many measured factors, which is informative for public health while we wait for further trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-bursts-and-health"&gt;Energy bursts and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about one quarter of U.S. adults meet both aerobic and strength targets, notes a CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db443.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding health linked to very short, vigorous effort embedded in daily life could help reach people who are not hitting those goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal shows up at low doses. That matters because many people cite time, cost, or access as barriers to regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. cohort’s median VILPA time was just over a minute per day, and the median burst count was about five per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most bursts lasted around 10 seconds, which aligns with the way people actually move when life gets busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose-response curve rose quickly at first, then flattened around eight bursts per day in this dataset. That pattern supports the idea that small, repeatable effort may offer a meaningful step up from doing none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-bursts-and-future-health"&gt;Energy bursts and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable sensors let scientists capture movement in 10-second windows, which makes it possible to study these micro patterns. That is a big advance over older surveys that missed very short efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials need to test whether nudging VILPA upward changes health markers directly. Those tests could use prompts during chores, commuting, or short work breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an observational analysis, so unmeasured differences could still explain part of the link. People who feel better might move more, and some health risks are hard to measure perfectly at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Device limits matter too. Wrist sensors can misread certain tasks, and any single week of tracking may not reflect a person’s full year of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health groups already say that all &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-form-of-exercise-is-shown-to-improve-sleep-the-most-according-to-studies/"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; counts. VILPA adds a sharp, practical edge to that message by focusing on brief, intense efforts that do not require special gear or set times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ongoing work shows cause and effect, simple cues could help people add a handful of short energy bursts to tasks they already do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of shift would be especially useful for those who do not visit gyms or prefer not to schedule workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.05.25333017v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;medRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 20:44:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNNDFXcE1zenBLX0doVVZCU1AtcnR5VVpPdFFfaGNCY3ZlRjZWanFRVjBvV0d4NEJDM2lSeC1YNzd1b05CSGNXZzJsT3VQclJIUnVmbG9iZk1mZC16ZTNHNWtKdGZGZFd3aW9GcnNNVTR5NUZQYXpLVkJueWJJMnlIbVI1NTktMi1ONGg5Wmo0TzlCblJlSTdhYkMzRU9YXy1wRE44SUtrMTlVT2xnTlpOQw</guid></item><item><title>我是一名流行病学家。我有关于结肠癌新研究的坏消息。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/colon-cancer-vegetables-broccoli-study-debunk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001b3b794ifppqum@published"&gt;There’s an old joke about the Daily Mail&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that is timeless: The tabloid likes to categorize every substance known to humankind as either a cause or cure of cancer. There was even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4abk9fd_lR4"&gt;a song&lt;/a&gt; put out by the BBC 15 years ago making fun of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001c3b79vrcd36na@published"&gt;The problem is that it’s not just the Daily Mail. In reality, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; love stories about causing or preventing cancer, so much so that most media sources are guilty of misrepresenting the evidence that appears in the many cancer-related studies published each year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001d3b79d40wkf9p@published"&gt;The latest series of articles is a wonderful example. A recent scientific publication has come out noting that there is a relationship between the intake of cruciferous vegetables—a large group that includes everything from broccoli to bok choi—and a reduced risk of colon cancer. The media &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/health/lower-colorectal-cancer-risk-by-20-by-eating-more-of-this-food/"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;, predictably, &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/risk-of-colon-cancer-slashed-by-eating-specific-types-of-vegetables-study-finds/ar-AA1La8YK"&gt;gone wild&lt;/a&gt;. If you believe the headlines, it would mean that we can slash our risk of a really nasty form of cancer with just a few florets of cauliflower a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="22" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001e3b793uqd19v6@published"&gt;Sadly, as an epidemiologist, I can tell you that the data are not nearly strong enough to draw such a meaningful conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001f3b7953t3ol9n@published"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9#Sec2"&gt;The new study&lt;/a&gt; is a systematic review of observational research. Observational research in this context means that scientists ask people what they eat, and then look at whether the foods they consume are linked to their long-term risk of cancer. A systematic review is a type of study that aggregates all of the studies on a topic and then combines them into a single analysis of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001g3b797tyfm5rs@published"&gt;In this case, if you look at all of the observational research on cruciferous vegetables and colon cancer, it appears that people who eat more of the veggies have less cancer. The highest levels of veggie-munching were associated with a 17 percent reduction in colon cancer risk across 17 studies compared to eating no cruciferous vegetables at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001h3b796d2nv3sy@published"&gt;The problem here is with that word &lt;em&gt;association. &lt;/em&gt;Thanks to this study and the predecessors it aggregates, we can say with some certainty that if you ask large groups of people what they eat, the people who say that they eat more broccoli each week are less likely to get colon cancer as time goes on. But what does that really mean?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duq001i3b79lpngcr7m@published"&gt;It’s very hard to know from studies like this whether eating more of the vegetables actually causes improved health or whether there is some other factor going on that isn’t measured properly in the study. People regularly lie on surveys about what they eat, or they forget and make mistakes. People who eat more vegetables are systematically different from people who eat fewer veggies, in ways that are hard to control for in studies like this. It might just be that rich people have more access to vegetables and are less likely to get cancer because they exercise more, or have less exposure to known carcinogens, rather than anything specific to cabbage or Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duq001j3b79t8v8qj1k@published"&gt;The authors of this systematic review did try to account for some of these issues, but a fundamental problem with large nutrition studies that simply ask people what they eat is that it’s really hard to eliminate the problems entirely. That’s why we run randomized clinical trials, which can account for all of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001k3b79obo3nkwh@published"&gt;Or, to quote the authors of the new review: “This meta-analysis suggests a potential inverse association between higher CV [cruciferous vegetables] intake and CC [colon cancer] incidence. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to methodological limitations.” This is basically science-speak for: “We don’t know if broccoli prevents cancer or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001m3b79uww689u4@published"&gt;This feels like just another case of the media blowing unimportant findings way out of proportion. Yes, there is some association between broccoli and good health, but we already knew that. There are probably dozens, if not hundreds, of diseases where you could find some positive association like this, but in my humble opinion, that news isn’t interesting or useful to your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001n3b79a9r72waq@published"&gt;When it comes to the question of individual foods causing or curing cancer, I don’t think we’ll ever have good answers. Even for red meat—which has been researched for decades—there’s no clear proof of a cancer link.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001o3b790cngor5i@published"&gt;It’s definitely true that your diet as a whole can raise or lower your risk of various diseases, but when it comes to specific foods, the evidence is much murkier. Don’t start spooning up coleslaw because you think it’ll stop you from getting cancer. If you like cabbage, eat &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of the hormone progesterone to gender-affirming hormone therapy leads to increased breast growth for transgender people following feminizing hormone therapy. This is demonstrated by an Amsterdam UMC-led trial among 90 participants and these results are presented today at the European Professional Association for Transgender Health (EPATH) annual congress in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that progesterone is safe and effective for transgender people. We're now able to prescribe it, in a trial setting, for those who have been taking oestradiol for at least year. We hope that our findings lead to better hormone treatments for transgender individuals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koen Dreijerink, endocrinologist at Amsterdam UMC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender-affirming hormone therapy helps an individual's body better align with their gender identity. In the case of feminizing hormone therapy this involves blocking the action of testosterone and the addition of estradiol. Traditionally, any breast growth is then limited, leading many transgender people to ultimately opt for breast augmentation surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Breast growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside estradiol, progesterone is one of the two key female sex hormones. Progesterone is known in cis women to also cause breast growth. However, progesterone has not been prescribed in transgender people due to a lack of evidence of its effectiveness and safety. In order to gain more information of the effect on breast volume as well as the safety of progesterone, Dreijerink and his colleagues conducted a randomly controlled trail between 2021 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among our 90 participants we repeatedly used 3D-scanning techniques to measure breast volume and saw up to an increase of 37%. Crucially, we also saw that the study participants were more satisfied with the size, shape and the growth of their breasts," adds Raya Geels, PhD candidate at Amsterdam UMC and the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest increase was seen in the group who also increased their estradiol dosage with some frequent side effects such as short-lasting tiredness, breast and nipple sensitivity and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study used progesterone for a year. "The reason we're moving forward with prescribing this in a research setting is to learn about the long-term effects and side-effects, for example we know that progesterone causes drowsiness so we advised our participants to take it prior to sleeping" adds Dreijerink. "It's important that we keep learning about the effects of gender affirming hormone therapy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8f392896-0bcd-42db-9c37-be05cc8d4b8a"&gt;A single dose of the psychedelic drug LSD may ease generalized anxiety disorder for months, a clinical trial has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial results, published Thursday (Sept. 4) in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838505?guestAccessKey=f420494d-a51d-442c-9d7c-4d14dbbe1aae&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090425" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838505?guestAccessKey=f420494d-a51d-442c-9d7c-4d14dbbe1aae&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090425" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include data from 194 people with moderate to severe anxiety across the U.S. The study compared these participants' responses to different doses of LSD against a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;placebo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treatment. It found that the drug alleviated symptoms in many patients for at least three months after just one exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8f392896-0bcd-42db-9c37-be05cc8d4b8a-2"&gt;That said, participants who were given low doses of LSD — either 25 or 50 micrograms — did not see a significant change in their symptoms. The effect kicked in only at higher doses — either 100 or 200 micrograms — and those given 100-microgram doses had the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e91f004e-a6ce-4417-b25a-5c76d16bad33"&gt;In fact, 12 weeks out from treatment, about 47% of the people who were given 100 micrograms were in remission, based on a standardized anxiety rating scale. And about 65% of the people in that group saw their scores on the scale fall by at least half. By comparison, only about 20% of the placebo group was in remission at the 12-week mark and about 30% saw their scores halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This work has the potential to make significant contributions to the emerging field of psychedelic drug research," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://psychiatry.queensu.ca/directory/faculty-gft/claudio-soares" target="_blank" data-url="https://psychiatry.queensu.ca/directory/faculty-gft/claudio-soares" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claudio Soares&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at the Queen's University School of Medicine in Ontario, wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838509" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838509" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;commentary about the trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's the first study to examine how different doses of LSD compare with a placebo for relieving anxiety. In addition, the trial didn't explicitly incorporate psychotherapy into the treatment, meaning it could help pin down whether LSD in and of itself has an anti-anxiety effect, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, the study highlighted an early response to treatment and positive effects on comorbid depressive symptoms, both of which are promising findings that should guide future trials," Soares said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/one-psychedelic-psilocybin-dose-eases-depression-for-years-study-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/one-psychedelic-psilocybin-dose-eases-depression-for-years-study-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 psychedelic psilocybin dose eases depression for years, study reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are approved anti-anxiety drugs, not all patients respond to them, the trial runners noted in their report. Estimates suggest about 50% of patients do not have an adequate response to first-line anxiety treatments, such as benzodiazepines or serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, which are also used for depression).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, there's still a need for more effective, well-tolerated anti-anxiety medicines, the trial runners argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter LSD. The psychedelic is thought to trigger its mind-altering effects — such as visual hallucinations and a feeling of being high — in part by enabling communication &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/lsd-breaks-down-barriers-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/lsd-breaks-down-barriers-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between brain cells that don't normally interact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's thought that this action might trigger a period of enhanced plasticity in the brain, during which a person with anxiety could break out of the harmful thought patterns that characterize the condition. But this mechanism is not fully understood and is still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials that have combined LSD with psychotherapy hinted that the drug can have a positive and sustained effect in treating anxiety. But because these trials were testing two interventions — LSD plus therapy — it's hard to know what LSD was contributing on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial aimed to investigate that question by including people who were not undergoing psychotherapy. In all, 18% of the participants were receiving external psychotherapy when they entered the study and continued receiving therapy during the study, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the 194 participants scored an average of 30 on an anxiety scale from 0 to 56, where the threshold for "severe" anxiety is 24. A score of 7 or less indicates remission. Patients given the 100-microgram dose saw, on average, a 21-point drop in their scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A treatment effect emerged 1 day after the dosing day and persisted through week 12," the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of side effects tied to the treatment were expected and resolved once the dosing of the drug concluded. These effects included visual perception changes, nausea, headache and euphoric mood. Notably, side effects were reported across all the study groups, including the placebo group, but occurred at the highest rates in the high-dose groups. For instance, more than 90% of the 100-microgram group reported hallucinations, as did 100% of the 200-microgram group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people reported "feeling intoxicated" in the 50- and 100-microgram groups, respectively, but felt normal by the end of the dosing session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f9e93fdf-f449-4954-8364-af70d7cf6ddd"&gt;Although the side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity, they did prompt a handful of people to drop out of the trial, so the LSD treatment may not be tolerable to all patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial does have some limitations, including the short follow-up time of only three months and the inclusion of some patients who still underwent therapy during the trial, Soares said. But in all, the trial provides crucial data that could help "further inform regulatory pathways for the use of psychedelic drugs as stand-alone treatments," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will be needed to evaluate how well the effects of the drug last over longer time frames, particularly after a single dose, he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ-HkDh9ROmyus8P3dO4FDwjr3l1hfqyjID" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ-HkDh9ROmyus8P3dO4FDwjr3l1hfqyjID slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Mittler said they got their Covid shots Thursday after the pharmacist said Medicare had updated the system there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9aade" class="body-graf"&gt;Their experiences are at odds with remarks from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-bipartisan-pushback-senate-hearing-moves-limit-vaccines-rcna229131" target="_blank"&gt;who told a Senate committee on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that most Americans are going to be able to get a Covid shot from their pharmacy for free. As HHS secretary, Kennedy oversees Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5acbcb" class="body-graf"&gt;Late last month, Kennedy announced that the FDA had approved updated Covid shots for the fall, but for a smaller, high-risk group: People 65 and up and those with underlying medical conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-363d84" class="body-graf"&gt;The limited approval&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-fall-covid-shots-may-come-copays-no-coverage-rcna226160" target="_blank"&gt; raised concerns about access&lt;/a&gt; for people outside the high-risk groups, but not for those eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b95ec4" class="body-graf"&gt;“Anybody can get the booster,” he told members of the Senate Finance Committee, when pressed about the limited eligibility. “Most Americans will be able to get it from their pharmacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-600805" class="body-graf"&gt;Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said if eligible patients are having trouble getting the vaccine, it heightens his concerns about limited access to vaccines under shifting policies from Kennedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f83aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“Medicare should be covering the shots, but it isn’t clearing people,” Caplan said. “So again, this just stirs up uncertainty about, ‘OK, am I eligible? Am I in the risk group?’ People still aren’t sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16c058" class="body-graf"&gt;The updated Covid shots began arriving at major pharmacy chains last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c56b28" class="body-graf"&gt;But some &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delayed-vaccine-meeting-shifting-policies-make-difficult-people-get-co-rcna228055" target="_blank"&gt;say they’re holding off in certain states&lt;/a&gt; until the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee issues its own recommendation on eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-829847" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices typically meets earlier in the summer to make its Covid vaccine recommendation. This year, the group isn’t scheduled to meet until Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6fa6c" class="body-graf"&gt;Medicare, however, doesn’t need to wait for CDC’s sign-off. Once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-882e72" class="body-graf"&gt;CVS, one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, said that in 13 states and Washington, D.C., everyone, including Medicare patients, will need a doctor’s prescription until ACIP issues its recommendations — and even then, eligibility will depend on age. In three states — Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico — CVS won’t be offering the Covid shot at all until ACIP acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0deef5" class="body-graf"&gt;“A few payers are still updating their systems and may not yet be set up to cover the updated Covid-19 vaccines,” CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said when asked about some Medicare patients who were told the vaccine wasn’t covered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976417" class="body-graf"&gt;“If this happens, our pharmacy teams can help patients schedule an appointment for a later date,” Thibault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c4184" class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7aaee2" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in an emailed statement that the agency was looking into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f2ded" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“CMS continues to monitor developments related to COVID-19 vaccines,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 19:56:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPMXdfYTJvcFJTcUNnelhVTWswbVRLWmVpYkttaHhxaExscG5ZYXBuVVAzLU9POXYtNll4c2FtT3pGelYtSWI5TkJ3aUhoYVlTQVhZZklYdXpDOG1FNk1BbFduUHFpbGJLcDRhY0M3cW9CbVBpWEptV3k0dTl1SDR4amNFcEV4TndBQWsyZWk1VmdrM3N0WjJOcHlfV0tPSFZreWxJ0gFWQVVfeXFMUEpnUzFnbHZQSXNfdjl5VEN1VWdwSjBYeEo2bHg1OC1McS1GQkxMaEtiVFBNdHlXMUtHYTlUcGYzWExMTTVWbnNCclVtSVlRYmRuWlY4SXc</guid></item><item><title>卡通：疫苗和白痴- Daily Kos</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/5/2341469/-Cartoon-Vaccines-and-blockheads</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__details"&gt;

The new report involves a facility in Beadle County that houses 52,600 birds. Other outbreaks in turkeys over the past week occurred in flocks in Faulk County, South Dakota, and in Dickey County, North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Source of California child's H5N1 infection still a mystery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related news, investigators from California and their partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday published their investigation findings into &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/san-francisco-reports-h5n1-avian-flu-child"&gt;one of two&lt;/a&gt; unexplained H5N1 infections in California children. They published the details in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7433a2.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school-age child's symptoms included fever, muscle pain, abdominal pain, and conjunctivitis ("pink eye"). They began on December 13, 2024, lasting 1 week and involving two healthcare visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first visit was at a local emergency department, where staff collected a nasopharyngeal sample that tested positive for influenza A and was sent to the San Francisco Department of Public Health's lab as part of enhanced surveillance. Further subtyping identified H5N1 on January 9, and follow-up sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the B3.13 genotype that had been circulating in dairy cattle, other mammals, poultry, and wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other family members had been sick, and polymerase chain reaction and serology testing of some of the child's close contacts revealed no evidence of human-to-human spread. A sample collected from the child on January 10 was still positive, but specimens collected 4 days after that were negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Poultry not likely the cause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family lived in an urban environment and had a pet dog. A family member had bought raw poultry at a live-bird market more than 2 weeks before the child's symptoms began. It was cooked and eaten the same day. Investigators wrote that poultry wasn't the likely source, given that poultry-market testing was negative, the child wasn't exposed to raw poultry, and the parents weren't sick. The investigators said the child spent time outdoors at school and may have had environmental exposure to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said continued surveillance and real-time subtyping at public health labs is a key part of novel flu surveillance and that detection of B3.13 serves as a reminder that the virus continues to transmit across susceptible species, requiring a strong One Health approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Think: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g60445031/losing-weight-without-tryin1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62628807/acute-liver-failure-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to tell if something is serious, but this list can help you know what not to just blow off. Especially if symptoms last longer than two weeks, oncologists would rather have you see a doc and err on the side of caution. “We don't take any chances, and we investigate thoroughly to make sure that we're taking the best care of people possible,” says Marla Lipsyc-Sharf, MD, an oncologist at UCLA Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are those symptoms an oncologist would want to investigate? They shared the top ones below. Keep in mind: Everything on this list can be explained by plenty of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; conditions, many of which are benign. Having one of them doesn’t mean you have cancer—it just means that it’s worth getting an all-clear from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/marla-lipsyc-sharf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marla Lipsyc-Sharf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marla Lipsyc-Sharf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a breast medical oncologist at UCLA Health. &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/despina-siolas-md-phd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Despina Siolas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Despina Siolas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/physicians/21461-thomas-buchholz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Buchholz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thomas Buchholz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of Scripps Cancer Center in San Diego, California. &lt;a href="https://siteman.wustl.edu/doctor/premal-thaker-md-ms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Premal H.

Thaker, MD, the chief of gynecologic oncology at the WashU Medicine Siteman Cancer Center. If all benign reasons are ruled out, the next step is to get a Pap test to screen for cervical cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Change In Bowel Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Colorectal cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; is "on the rise in younger people for reasons that we don't quite understand,” says Despina Siolas, MD, an oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, so it’s important to take any changes in bowel habits seriously (and to remember to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65566865/fiber-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat enough fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eat enough fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding that persists for greater than two weeks are among potential warning signs. A change in bowel habits is also a possible sign of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65914070/ovarian-cancer-detection-research/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ovarian cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are incredibly vague (think bowel changes, bloating, changes in urination, and feeling full quickly), Dr. Thaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changing bowel habits aren’t just indicative of cancer. Many women struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65783485/hypnotherapy-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and other related illnesses—all of which warrant a visit to your doc. So no matter what, it’s important to bring those symptoms to someone to get checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Unexplained Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[If] you're losing more than 10 pounds, and you don't understand why, that's usually a sign that something is wrong,” says Dr. Siolas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re experiencing weight loss over the course of a few weeks or a longer period of time, if it’s unexplained, it’s a potential red flag. “Adults don’t lose weight without trying pretty hard to do so,” says Therese Bartholomew Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “So, it could be a 10-pound weight loss over a one month period or a six month period, but the individual was not trying to lose weight and had not changed their diet. Both are a concern to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If weight loss is cancer-related, it could be because the tumor is taking up valuable vitamins and nutrients from the rest of the body, but weight loss could also be attributed to many benign conditions, like hyperthyroidism, which is caused by your body producing too much thyroid hormone. Having a gluten intolerance could lead to malabsorption, which could also cause weight loss, says Steve Lo, MD, the director of medical oncology at the Bennett Cancer Center at Stamford Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Unexplained Weight Gain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, “if you have unexplained weight gain in your abdomen accompanied by discomfort, that's also a sign that maybe there's something that needs to be checked out,” says Dr. Siolas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone with cancer that originates in the abdomen is experiencing weight gain, it’s usually related to fluid retention, says Dr. Siolas. That’s because the early stages of a tumor can attract a lot of fluid and cause bloating, which is why it may appear you’re gaining weight in the abdomen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Persistent Pain In Your Abdomen Or Pelvis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have persistent pain around your pelvis or abdomen, your first step is to head to the gyno for a pelvic exam. It’s a symptom that could be indicative of a number of issues, including painful periods, pain after sex, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850931/halsey-endometriosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:endometriosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64688867/pcos-weight-loss-workout-strength-transformation-improve-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polycystic ovary syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr. Thaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases though, pelvic pain could be a symptom of endometrial cancer. Screening for endometrial cancer typically involves a biopsy or dilation and curettage (D&amp;amp;C) she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have PCOS, there’s good reason to pay close attention. “PCOS is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, but it is unclear exactly how,” Dr. Thaker says. Some research suggests premenopausal women who have PCOS are around five times more at risk for endometrial cancer, according to a 2023 meta-analysis published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10028221/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oncology Letters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Oncology Letters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Enlarged Lymph Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lymph nodes can be found all over the body—from the neck, to the underarms, to the groin area. When lymph nodes are enlarged, the most common cause is actually inflammation or a viral or bacterial infection, says Dr. Lo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, swollen lymph nodes—especially ones that persist for more than two weeks—should raise some red flags, says Dr. Thaker. They could be indicative of a variety of cancers, including lymphoma or carcinoma, says Dr. Lo. Though there are exceptions, “cancerous lymph nodes tend to be hard, [while] reactive lymph nodes tend to be soft and tender,” Dr. Lo describes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Changes In The Skin Of Your Breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness, swelling, warmth, and/or dimpled skin on your breasts (resembling the appearance of an orange peel), are symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)—a condition that mimics the appearance of a breast infection, says Thomas Buchholz, MD, the medical director of Scripps Cancer Center. “It's a more aggressive form of breast cancer that is commonly diagnosed because the patient themselves notices a change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, more often than not, color changes on the breasts are actually caused by a rash. “Fungal infections are very common under the breast, especially in the summertime, when people are getting good, sweaty workouts in,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. At that point, a doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal cream or medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the area and color change persist for more than a week, and the root cause is determined not to be fungal, your doctor might recommend imaging for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;A New Lump That’s Not Going Away &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump feels ominous, and without the help of a biopsy, it’s often tricky to differentiate between a cancerous lump, and something less serious (such as an enlarged lymph node), says Dr. Thaker. But some reassurance: “Oftentimes, the lumps that we find are benign,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. Still, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t head to your doctor to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I usually recommend to my patients, my friends, and my family is when they first notice something, make a note in their calendar for two weeks from now,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. After two weeks, if the same lump is still there, contact your primary care doctor to schedule an appointment for a physical exam to determine if you need imaging of that area, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the lump is located in your breast, your provider can recommend the best breast screening plan for you, which likely includes a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62489379/mammogram-screening-guidelines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mammogram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mammogram&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly an ultrasound, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Persistent Breast Tenderness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33806639/inflammatory-breast-cancer-mastitis-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breast tenderness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;breast tenderness&lt;/a&gt; in both breasts in pre-menopausal women is hormonal fluctuations (a.k.a. your period), says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. That’s why she always encourages patients to monitor their symptoms over the course of a couple of weeks to see if that tenderness persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty common to experience breast tenderness during certain points of your menstrual cycle, especially if you’re experiencing it on both sides, says Dr. Thaker. But if the tenderness is still there after a few weeks, and doesn't seem to be fluctuating in tune with your hormonal changes, bring it up with a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Nipple Bleeding Or Discharge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nipple bleeding and discharge can sometimes occur during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and could be as simple &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/non-cancerous-breast-conditions/intraductal-papillomas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as a papilloma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as a papilloma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a wart-like growth that develops within your milk ducts, per the ACS. But rarely, this symptom could be indicative of breast cancer, says Dr. Buchholz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing nipple bleeding or discharge, regardless of whether you’re pregnant, you should seek care. “Still, [patients] should know that more often than not, these are benign changes rather than cancerous changes,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Coughing Or Shortness Of Breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lingering cough or shortness of breath could arise from your run-of-the-mill cold, infection, allergies, environmental exposures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma. But they’re also two baseline symptoms of lung cancer, says Saiama N. Waqar, a professor of medicine at WashU Medicine and medical oncologist at the WashU Medicine Siteman Cancer Center. If these symptoms continue for more than two weeks, and you’re unsure why, it’s time to see a doctor, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest risk factor [for lung cancer] is &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65615034/drunk-cigarettes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cigarette smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cigarette smoking&lt;/a&gt;—and that still remains the case,” says Dr. Waqar. Still, between 10 and 20 percent of lung cancer cases occur in people who have never smoked or had fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,2%2C900%20of%20these%20lung%20cancers." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your cough reaches the point where you’re seeing blood, you’ll need to be seen more urgently, says Dr. Waqar. Coughing up blood isn’t a universal symptom of lung cancer, but a tumor sitting in your main airway could lead to it. This symptom could also be caused by something more benign (but still serious) like pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Being More Tired Than Usual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a37622303/lyme-disease-chronic-fatigue-misdiagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Feeling chronically fatigued;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Feeling chronically fatigued&lt;/a&gt; could be caused by several things, including endocrine disorders, psychiatric issues (like depression), kidney concerns, and heart, lung, and bowel absorption problems, Dr. Lo says. That said, “cancer &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cause fatigue, and again, that's the challenge that the primary care physician has,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy is a complicated biological process, and everyone will have a different baseline as to what qualifies as fatigue, but if you're having noticeable changes in your energy level or ability to do things, that's a sign you need to talk to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if you don’t have any of these symptoms, don’t skip your screenings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cancer, there might not be any signs at all—and that’s where screening comes in. “Screening is so important because it actually can detect cancer at a very early stage, such that it does not become a long term problem,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching cancer earlier via screening means that you’ve hopefully caught it at “a more curable stage of the disease,” says Dr. Buchholz. “Over 90 percent of people survive breast cancer, and the survival is very dependent on the stage of the disease or detecting it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, if you’re someone with a family history of cancer, you might be recommended to get screenings even earlier than others. Doctors can actually estimate your risk of cancer using the health information you provide, and then give you a more tailored screening plan. “Knowing your risk can help to find cancers even when there are no symptoms present,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 18:40:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBmVHFNTjlwQnh3ckZJMFRmWGZ4SE1JRldSN05aQ0NYVGRXcTRpY21PQi1hWTFKTllvWmNzZlV4a3RzRkQxbUxtQ3dtOWIxUE41RE5BbFhhQU04VE9sUGNtZnBlUWUzWThvRGlPT2xtWHk5X1JsRmJIcV9fQQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
