  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;New research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; offers benefits beyond just protein intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;In a study published in the journal Nutrients on Aug. 29, Canadian researchers monitored the resistance training of 30 healthy, young adult men and analyzed their post-workout snacks of carbohydrates and Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that adding Greek yogurt to men's diets lowered certain inflammation markers more effectively than carbohydrates alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-blueberries-earlier-life-could-ease-allergies-strengthen-immunity-new-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EATING BLUEBERRIES EARLIER IN LIFE COULD EASE ALLERGIES, STRENGTHEN IMMUNITY, NEW STUDY FINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that post-workout Greek yogurt not only supports muscle growth, but may also help regulate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a normal response to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;strength training,&lt;/a&gt; when muscle fibers develop small tears. It occurs through soreness, stiffness and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greek yogurt may help reduce post-workout inflammation markers more effectively than carbs, a new study says.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn Bates, a certified clinical nutritionist and author of the upcoming cookbook "How to Eat," told Fox News Digital that Greek yogurt's &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protein content&lt;/a&gt; makes it an ideal post-workout snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is the primary nutrient needed to recover from a workout," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/food-medicine-movement-may-key-reversing-health-decline-heres-what-eat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'FOOD IS MEDICINE' MOVEMENT MAY BE KEY TO REVERSING HEALTH DECLINE: HERE'S WHAT TO EAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greek yogurt is rich in an amino acid called leucine, which is required for optimal muscle repair and recovery. Carbs can help replace muscle glycogen, but it does not provide the building blocks needed, amino acids, for muscle recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bates, who is also a personal trainer, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/food-prep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;makes her own&lt;/a&gt; Greek yogurt and said she saves about $450 a year by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greek yogurt can be paired with other anti-inflammatory foods to support wellness, health experts say.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reap the full benefits of the dairy dish, she said to only purchase plain, unsweetened and – ideally – full-fat Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Full-fat has been found to be more satiating than low-fat versions, which means you're less likely &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/snack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to snack&lt;/a&gt; between meals," Bates noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plus, full-fat dairy is significantly higher in vitamin K2, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;necessary nutrient&lt;/a&gt; for bone, heart and dental health. Because vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, you remove most of it when you opt for low-fat dairy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Charton, a celebrity fitness trainer based in Georgia, noted Greek yogurt's probiotic benefits, which support &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gut health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Because vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, you remove most of it when you opt for low-fat dairy," a personal trainer told Fox News Digital.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, eating other anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raw nuts&lt;/a&gt; and seeds, berries, leafy greens and healthy fats, like olive oil, while reducing processed foods, trans fats, refined sugars and avoiding alcohol and smoking can also help reduce inflammation in our body," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MORE FROM FOX NEWS LIFESTYLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainer told Fox News Digital that regular exercise and getting enough sleep are also crucial to reducing inflammatory markers, as well as staying hydrated and avoiding stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taking high-quality supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;certain vitamins,&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin D, may help reduce inflammation," Charton added. "But always consult with a healthcare provider and get blood work done so you can see where your inflammation and blood levels are at before starting any new supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nutritionists recommend plain, unsweetened, full-fat Greek yogurt to maximize potential health and fitness benefits.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not a fan of Greek yogurt's tangy taste, Bates suggests mixing in protein powder to balance the flavor or blending it into a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as you're eating enough protein, including protein from Greek yogurt, within 24 hours after your workout, then you'll still see amazing benefits," she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:55:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQa0ZoUDlzUXZPd1lEekV5UEtkLVUtS084REdsSjQxdXdTVVRnT0FscGs2VndrVGxsZXZEcjJmdGJXRXkySml0ZjhMRlBSOXVNOFhNRHBpZ0txZzlKMFQyLTRyRlhXV1U4ckRnVURBU0Y2ZW9zM0M0cUFEWTBpWnVWWnVKQ1ZSSm44WlJvOWVINVpfRGZtN0JuTA</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心支持更新的新冠疫苗，因为访问问题仍然存在： “我们仍然没有剂量” -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/cdc-covid-vaccines-misinformation-access-issues</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US has officially adopted recommendations for the updated Covid vaccines, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Monday – paving the way to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt; vaccines to more than half of children in the US who were unable to access them while the recommendations were in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the delays, and the announcement itself, compound misinformation and persistent access issues, providers and experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted on 19 September to recommend Covid &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to anyone over the age of six months with shared provider decision-making. The ACIP vote on Covid vaccines was itself delayed from June to mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7f350e48-d547-4279-971a-3305a571ec40" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"States rally to offset fracturing of federal healthcare agencies: ‘Diseases don’t see state lines’","elementId":"7f350e48-d547-4279-971a-3305a571ec40","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/states-healthcare-vaccines-recommendations"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jim O’Neill, acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially signed off on the recommendation last week, according to an HHS press release – though the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; on ACIP recommendations has not yet been updated with these details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC also officially removed the recommendation for the combined MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, the statement said. This vaccine is preferred by one in six parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;O’Neill said providers were previously deterred from counseling patients on the benefits and risks of Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Informed consent is back,” O’Neill said in the statement. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were no limitations on such discussions, which are common between patients and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people mime their vaccine request, there’s always some discussion before a vaccine is given,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor focused on vaccines at UC Law San Francisco .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When patients go to a pharmacy or a doctor’s office for vaccines, they are already undergoing shared decision-making, Reiss said. “Unless the goal is to only have the conversation to deter people, what does this do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also beyond the ACIP’s purview to require discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thomas Nguyen, a pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at Ohio University Medical School, notes “the problem is they aren’t allowed to do this”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Federal law allows the CDC to update its Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), which providers must offer to every vaccine recipient or their caregiver. But “they have no basis to require a discussion”, he said, and informed consent is already the standard for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every pediatric Covid vaccine we have given, I have offered to discuss the risks and benefits with the family and every single one has declined,” Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The families who are getting Covid vaccines already know they want it, he continued. “The people who want to get a Covid vaccine for their kids are the ones who are really committed to it, who have done their research and feel like it’s a good idea for their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the delays in recommending the vaccines have created obstacles for families who want them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program covers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/pdfs/mm7333e1-H.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;52%&lt;/a&gt; of children in the US: anyone under the age of 19 who is under-insured or uninsured, eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid, or Native American or Alaska Native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccines are included in the program only when they’re recommended by the CDC, so children who would normally receive Covid vaccines through VFC have not been able to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every visit this fall has been the same, said Elias Kass, a naturopathic physician in Washington state specializing in pediatric primary care. Families asked about seasonal vaccines, and he told them about the annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Then they say: ‘And Covid?’” Each time, he answered: “Nope. We don’t have Covid vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Washington is one of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/resources/aim-policy-maps/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;12 states and territories&lt;/a&gt;, along with the city of Houston, with a universal VFC program, which means they offer vaccines for free to all children (and, in some places, all adults). In universal states, providers order all vaccines through the VFC program – but they couldn’t order any Covid vaccines at all without the CDC recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We still don’t have doses in hand,” Kass said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The timing was critical, as flu vaccination campaigns have already gotten under way for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are missing a really crucial window to vaccinate kids. We have been giving flu vaccines for a couple of weeks,” Kass said. “​​It’s a huge lost opportunity. I don’t know if we’ll get those families to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition to limiting boosters for young children, the delay has “created this huge gap for our infants”, Kass said, “who are at very high risk of complicated Covid”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Covid vaccines have been plagued by persistent access issues and misinformation, resulting in already low vaccination rates among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Approximately 10,000 six-month-olds become eligible to receive Covid-19 vaccines every day, but parents continue to struggle to find access to that vaccine,” said Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer of the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the stakes are high. Children under two, especially infants, are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high risk&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalization and death, second only to people aged 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children may also suffer from long Covid, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/health/long-covid-children.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;repeat infections&lt;/a&gt;, and unknown complications could arise long after infection – as sometimes happens with viruses like measles, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, and cytomegalovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The delay caused “huge” equity issues, Kass said, especially among children who have been marginalized within the health system because of socioeconomic status or racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were already significant access issues plaguing pediatric vaccines across the country, with some providers declining to stock the vaccines due to a perceived lack of interest and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The argument that I often hear from pediatricians is that they don’t stock Covid vaccines because there’s low demand,” said Fiscus. “But the reality is that parents do call and ask for the vaccine, but are told that it’s not being stocked. So to an extent, that’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some providers offer outdated reasons for not stocking the vaccines, like previous needs for ultra-cold storage or multi-dose vials, Kass said. “They’re justifying not stocking it with reasons that are no longer relevant, but they’re assuming nobody wants it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS press release also highlighted “vaccine safety signals” and “unintended side effects during routine immunization”, even though the Covid vaccines are extremely safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s “the biggest problem” among Nguyen’s patients, he said. Certain health officials and Republican politicians have been very vocal about the purported risks of Covid vaccines “to the point that almost nobody wants them”, he said. This fall, he has given out 325 flu shots and only 16 Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaE1GNFFqZ0t6ZlNoOVp6UnJIWHF3eXlaWXE4UUNIbGN3M3c1elFDRUN6NXk4RHRCMjZDRWVKRF9xbldRMFdZRUVZZl9sVXZkZUVXencxamF1aXFUNE43WUFLMXI5Uy03SVpnRkF4X0dTcHRhTnpYajZYRW9zZGZQWG96b1BjMUdhRDdWTVFDRlYwUnB0cGp2S2QtNA</guid></item><item><title>服用太多泰诺已被证明有风险。特朗普没有谈论这些。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/tylenol-acetominophen-liver-damage-kenvue.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:43:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUFdadVpJVVNzYnUtU091bTRNaWJWLXQ5bUs4cW1vUGVFSUVzZ3puYkJ5REtZOUpiU0c3LTVPUm14Yy1CTU5fRXQteVgzWl9Ua0F3Nnc3M1VVbzVvM3U0ekZyRU94MG00LWI2VnFsd1dmRmdqdmotdG5Cb0xVUlkzc01fOWN0U1pwMDFETDZBRmplUQ</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎专家建议在疫情结束仅三年后再次佩戴口罩- The Mirror</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/wear-a-face-mask-covid-36026620</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_4d0286" publication="mirror"&gt;Covid experts advise wearing masks again just three years after pandemic ended&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_1cc836" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Some people are being urged to start wearing face masks again as we enter the winter period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_byline-container__K_Owl" data-testid="byline"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-content" class="Byline_byline-content-wrapper__Imque"&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_author-badge-date-wrapper__Q7jj1"&gt;&lt;p class="Byline_dates-container__Rqzf2"&gt;&lt;span class="" data-testid="byline-publishedDate"&gt;13:16, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Byline_updated-date__8vEV8 Byline_updated-date-with-published__ApG_G" data-testid="byline-updatedDate"&gt;Updated 13:21, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="LightboxBtn_lightbox-btn__eoxYS" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="36026878"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Some people are being asked to wear face masks once again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-credit__uNiU6"&gt;(Image: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;Swiss&lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt; Covid experts &lt;/a&gt;are saying members of the public should start wearing face masks again, just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic officially ended.

                Insecticide-treated bed nets keep mosquitoes from biting at night, but what how do you protect babies when they're out and about? One researcher had an idea that involved the traditional bab-carrying wrap used in sub-Saharan Africa.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/people/ross-boyce-md-msc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ross Boyce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It seems sort of an obvious thing to do," he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/11/22/503036774/the-new-debate-over-bed-nets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bed nets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can only protect kids while they're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. "That was probably overkill," says Boyce. "But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The answer: a resounding yes. "It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations," says Boyce.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501628" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a reduction of about 65%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so," says &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/trmd/thom-eisele" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thomas Eisele&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools," says Eisele. "These types of interventions are going to be critical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/11/627843581/if-you-spray-your-clothes-with-permethrin-be-careful-around-the-cat" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Permethrin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin," he says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered," he says, "but we know getting malaria is not good for children either."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/authors/edgar-mulogo-6r142y3bct" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edgar Mulogo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. "The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous," he says. He heard one participant say "when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            Most Americans with health insurance should not have to pay out of pocket for Covid-19 vaccines, even after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added an extra hurdle to getting the shot. But some people could face new costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6m90002356ng3l57x4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC adopted its &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F09%2F19%2Fhealth%2Fcdc-acip-hepatitis-mmrv-covid-vaccine&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507123670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zXUXbx06rkpD4C0bYjhwvyS0wUIOvJh1y8Tcn7E1HiY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisers’ vote&lt;/a&gt; to shift away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 immunization; people who want one must now consult with a health care provider, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. However, a prescription is not necessarily needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0003356nhsph25kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the change raised concerns that insurers would no longer be required to cover the full cost of the immunization. The Affordable Care Act mandates that most private insurers cover vaccines recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, at no cost. Meanwhile, Medicaid’s no-cost coverage of vaccines is also tied to the committee’s recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0004356n2j3rcn2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (Medicare is required by law to cover the Covid-19 vaccine with no cost-sharing, so it is not affected by the committee’s recommendation.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0005356npitxukdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee’s vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and Medicare, as well as insurance plans through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace,” a US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in a statement last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0006356nw2yfrl0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, it may not be that cut-and-dry, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0007356nwbnu3z6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Insurers may not unanimously agree that they have to cover vaccines with shared decision-making recommendations at no cost, although the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CDC&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has attempted to clarify that such recommendations should fall under Obamacare’s mandate, said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. That injects “ambiguity” into the extent of the coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0008356nei4y9udk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many private insurance plans are regulated by a trio of departments: Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, which have not issued guidance on shared decision-making. Other private plans are regulated by states, at least 13 of which have taken steps to require the insurers they regulate to continue to provide Covid-19 vaccines for free to patients, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fcovid-19%2Ftracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507144725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=mfvLLlNtPvAgdgbcRznhOylLtcxHgvDlnWiYHqrpVWE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0009356nwrsxqwby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The nation’s largest trade association for health insurers said its members – which cover more than 200 million Americans – indicated that any recommendations stemming from the committee’s meeting would not have an impact on policyholders’ coverage through the end of 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000a356nepi5kh3y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement before the ACIP meeting in September that its members would continue to cover all immunizations that the committee had recommended as of September 1 at no cost to patients. This includes the updated Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000b356npe58kf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health plans are committed to maintaining and ensuring affordable access to vaccines,” said the association, which told CNN that shared decision-making recommendations must be covered without cost-sharing. “Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000c356n7r7iba53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, UnitedHealthcare said it will fully cover Covid-19 vaccines recommended by ACIP as of January 1 in its standard commercial plans, although it noted that people who have certain job-based policies should check with their employers. UnitedHealthcare, which is not an AHIP member, is the nation’s largest insurer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000d356nn438vs7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “UnitedHealthcare is committed to enabling access to safe, effective and affordable care, including coverage for vaccinations,” the company said in a statement after last month’s ACIP vote. “Vaccines are an important and effective way to protect the health of individuals, families and communities, and members should talk with their health care providers to determine if a vaccine is clinically appropriate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000e356nm0l8xtvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The insurer noted that its “coverage will remain guided by federal and state mandates as well as the available clinical evidence, including the recommendations of professional societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000f356nst8qq8rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers will cover all vaccines recommended by the committee&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January 1 with no cost to patients through the end of next year, while operating within federal and state laws, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000g356n2w6dji0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some insurers could now argue that they aren’t mandated to pick up the entire tab for the Covid-19 vaccine, which costs about $140.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000h356nrvjcil4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s nothing that requires insurers to cover vaccines not recommended by ACIP at no cost,” Killelea said. “Where it could be ambiguous is whether all insurers will view a shared decision-making recommendation as a full recommendation from ACIP.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000i356nqnnvkfsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medicaid enrollees will continue to receive the vaccine at no cost, per earlier guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Killelea said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000j356nd36dwl4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, the CDC advisory committee also voted that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine would no longer be recommended before age 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000k356nyt0u209y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means private insurers will not be required to cover it at no cost, so if parents want their children to have the combined vaccine, they could have to pay for it – if they could get it at all, said Jen Kates, senior vice president at KFF. Vaccine makers may not continue to manufacture it, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000l356ncqkk9a1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, the combined vaccine will no longer be automatically covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, though states could opt to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000m356nub1vm3z3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee voted not to have the MMRV immunization covered by the Vaccines for Children program, which provides access for low-income children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000n356nudd6jyoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The separate vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella and against varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox, will continue to be recommended and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be covered at no cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hermina Nedelescu, a neuroscientist at the institute and study co-author, added: 'It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress—and that could be a game changer in how we think about relapse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterised by cycles of withdrawal, sobriety and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that when rats were initially given alcohol, they learnt to associate it with pleasure and seek more alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, the researchers noted that this connection was stronger after a few cycles of withdrawal and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After learning that drinking eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal—such as loss of appetite, nausea, depression, agitation and fatigue—the rats sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even in uncomfortable situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or context with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli—even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking,' Prof Weiss explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behaviour is punished.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that this negative reinforcement—the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress—and the activation of the PVT in the brain in response is crucial for how we learn and perpetuate addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nedelescu added: 'This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now hope to expand the study to look at gender-specific behaviours  to pinpoint the exact molecules and neurochemicals that are involved in the brain processes driving so many people to the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weiss added: 'As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about causing pleasure—it's about escaping those negative hedonic states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest official figures shows deaths from alcohol have soared to a record high in Britain with almost 10,5000 alcohol-related deaths in 2023 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO estimate it kills three million people around the world each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS recommends people drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week—the equivalent of six pints of beer, or six medium glasses of wine—spread out over at least three days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have recently warned that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15126395/NO-safe-alcohol-dementia-risk-experts-study.html"&gt;no amount of alcohol is 'safe'&lt;/a&gt;, adding that slashing alcohol intake could 'play a significant role in dementia prevention'.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent polls suggests that the average Briton drinks roughly 18 units of alcohol a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those concerned they may have a problem with alcohol should visit their GP, who can make an assessment and refer them to specialist clinics for counselling and help with withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, shakiness, vomiting and fast heart rate, usually resolve within a week, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular drinking has also been linked to increased risks of high blood pressure, liver disease and several cancers, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"The front door for these viruses is our nose and that tissue right in the back of our noses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2838335"&gt;The German study of 450 adults published&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 2 found that those who took azelastine — an antihistamine sold under the brand names Astepro and Astelin — were much less likely to contract viral infections than those who took a placebo. It came after other recent research also suggested that different types of nasal sprays may prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner, who was not involved in the study, said more testing is needed, because the study involved relatively small numbers of people or were done on animals. Larger studies will determine how effective the sprays are in the real world, and at what dosages and frequencies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research over the past few years&lt;/strong&gt; has suggested that nasal sprays could help prevent COVID-19, the flu and the common cold, although larger studies are needed to confirm findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study released last month found that azelastine,&lt;/strong&gt; an antihistamine, significantly reduced the chance of getting ill from COVID-19 or the common cold. Researchers say it could potentially be used before going into high-risk situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;have been developed that, &lt;/b&gt;early research indicates, could almost fully block virus transmission. But they likely would have to be used once or multiple times a day, and experts believe people are unlikely to do that for year-round protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he said, viruses must attach to and enter cells to make you sick, and the most common entry point for respiratory viruses is the nose. Scientists believe that medications given through the nose have the potential to be more effective than those injected into the body because they attack or block the virus at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner said that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;Trump administration funding cutbacks and shifts&lt;/a&gt; in how it approaches COVID-19 vaccines are taking away money from nasal-spray initiatives and could delay the development of nasal vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo/Wladimir Bulgar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receiving azelastine in the antihistamine study used it three times a day for an average of 56 days. Researchers found they were about three times less likely to become infected with COVID-19 or with rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, than people who didn't. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32546-z"&gt;A previous, smaller study on azelastine&lt;/a&gt; had roughly similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early antihistamine doubts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking a chemical that causes allergic symptoms. Because of that, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Medicine, said she and other physicians wondered whether antihistamines could protect against the coronavirus. But, she said, anecdotally "it did not seem to make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What may be different today is that almost everyone has either contracted COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 vaccine, and that could lead to a different type of immune system response, Nachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cautioned against anyone using azelastine to prevent COVID-19 or colds until after a larger study is conducted and analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had mixed results in looking at other nasal sprays, such as those made from nitric oxide and a red seaweed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on nasal sprays is not new. There is a federally approved nasal spray — FluMist — used as a flu vaccine. It was first approved for some age groups in 2003 and is about as effective as a traditional shot, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in research into nasal sprays in recent years is in part because of efforts to find more effective vaccines against COVID-19, said Dr. Paul Spearman, vice chair for clinical and translational research and education at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, but their ability to prevent transmission wanes within weeks after the shot is given, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you could make a vaccine that prevented the initial infection or prevented the spread, then that would be two steps up above what we've got now," Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Promising nose gel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston's Brigham and Women’s Hospital last year said they developed &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/drug-free-nasal-spray-may-shield-against-respiratory-infections"&gt;a gel-like spray that coats&lt;/a&gt; the inner lining of the nose and was almost 100% effective in blocking viruses from infecting the noses of mice, and in a 3D model of the human nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is other research also looking at gels. But the gel must be reapplied to remain effective, Spearman said. In the Harvard research, it remained protective for up to eight hours. It’s unlikely most people would apply a gel every day or multiple times a day for the entire year to prevent getting a cold or COVID-19, Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The azelastine findings also indicate that sustained use of the antihistamine is needed to provide protection. The study’s authors said it could be used before going into "high-risk settings, such as large gatherings or travel." But more research is needed to determine how often and for how many days it should be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman led &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0896"&gt;the first U.S. human clinical trial &lt;/a&gt;of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine — released in July — that showed that people who received higher doses of the spray were significantly less likely to have COVID-19 symptoms than those getting a low dose. It was of 61 people, and a much larger study is needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman said generating an immune response in the nose offers great promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you do that, then whenever the virus comes around, your immune cells just take care of it, and ideally, you'd prevent the virus from then getting into the lung or getting in anywhere else where it would make you sick," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="David Olson" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

People with this condition have a possible risk for more significant liver problems or other conditions like cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study focused on how sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages related to liver health. Based on analysis of over 103,000 participants, higher consumption of both beverage types was linked to a higher risk for MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to a greater risk for liver-related mortality. While the study hasn’t been published yet, the findings shed light on the potential risks of these beverages, particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results were presented at &lt;a href="https://ueg.eu/week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UEG Week 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UEG Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the annual congress of United European Gastroenterology. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drinking more than 1 can of any soda daily linked to liver problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective cohort study where researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined data from 103,251 participants who did not have baseline liver disease. The median follow-up was a little over 10 years, and during this time “949 participants developed MASLD, and 103 died from liver-related causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their consumption of sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. Researchers were also able to consider participants’ liver fat content based on MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the associations between drinking these beverages and someone’s risk for MASLD. They also looked at liver-related mortality and liver-fat content and their association with the related beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consuming more than 330 grams (g), or about 1 can, of drinks from either beverage category daily was associated with a higher risk for developing MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with about a 50% greater risk for MASLD, and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with 60% greater risk. The results also found that consuming either beverage type was linked to liver fat content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drinking low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk for liver-related mortality, but sugar-sweetened beverages did not have a significant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the association between low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and liver-related mortality was dose-dependent; drinking more was linked to a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swapping soda for water helps lower liver disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at substituting beverages, researchers found that switching out 330 g of either beverage type daily for water helped to decrease risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect was a little larger when switching out sugar-sweetened beverages for water, which decreased MASLD risk by 14.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that switching out the beverage types for each other did not change the risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the potential danger of both beverages, but particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages, on liver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lihe-Liu-2274143134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lihe Liu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lihe Liu&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), often seen as healthier alternatives because they use sugar substitutes, may not be entirely risk-free. We found that frequent consumption was still linked with liver health risks, which challenges the common belief that these drinks are completely ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ substitutes for sugary beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study limitations and continued research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, which makes it challenging to know the full limitations of the research. However, beverage intake was something reported by participants, which may not have been their true intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also does not establish that consumption of these beverages causes liver problems. It’s also unclear what covariates researchers adjusted for in their analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank is has its own limitations too, including the fact that it includes &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:primarily white participants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;primarily white participants&lt;/a&gt;, and they tend to be healthier than the United Kingdom’s general population. For this reason, additional follow-up research will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Liu explained the next steps to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, saying that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to complete and submit the full manuscript for peer review and publication, which will allow the scientific community to scrutinize and build upon our findings. Looking ahead, more research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to liver disease, and to explore whether different types of sweeteners carry different risks. Long-term studies in more diverse populations will also be important to strengthen the evidence base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the clinical implications?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required, the findings do give another reason for avoiding drinks like soda and their diet counterparts. It also highlights that opting for water instead may help to decrease MASLD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may carry risks for liver health. Clinically, this highlights the need to guide people toward healthier beverage choices, with water remaining the safest and healthiest option,” Liu explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.eatwell2livebetter.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karen Z.

And the potential side effects are related to the fact that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; so powerful, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not everyone who takes GLP-1s will have side effects, some will, and they can range from mild to life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, doctors share the most common side effects of GLP-1 medications and how best to avoid these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomiting, nausea and other gastrointestinal issues are common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most commonly reported side effects are GI-related: nausea, constipation, loose stools, vomiting,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these don’t happen to everyone. In clinical trials, nausea was the most commonly reported side effect and impacted 44% of people, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These meds are mimicking a natural hormone [GLP-1] and amplifying it ... so, you can imagine it will impact people differently, because just how sensitive you are to these hormones. So the side effects that are most common are related to the impact of the medication [and] the impact it has on the movement of the food,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication slows down the movement of food through your gut, Parrella said, which makes the above gastrointestinal symptoms common, in addition to things such as acid reflux, heartburn and burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehydration and a lack of nutrients can happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who take GLP-1s don’t get hunger and thirst signals as often as they would off of the medication, Lofton said. While this is a common occurrence, it can lead to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some individuals, they might not be eating enough or drinking enough fluids, so it can cause risks related to dehydration or not having enough electrolytes, or possibly not eating enough nutrients, such as protein or fiber,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often get fuller faster, which leads to less food consumption and, in turn, fewer necessary nutrients, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more serious adverse effects, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the [adverse] effects that people will talk about ... would be pancreatitis, and that’s an inflammation in the pancreas. ... This medication is intended to make your pancreas work a little bit [harder], so that it pumps out more insulin when you eat foods that increase blood glucose,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, basically, the starchy carbs and the sugary foods, if you eat those, your pancreas has to work harder with these medications, and it pumps out a lot more insulin than usual,” she noted. This overactivity can cause pancreatitis in some people, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallstones and gallbladder inflammation are also associated with the use of GLP-1s, Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, if someone vomits too much, they become dehydrated, which can cause kidney failure,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal obstruction can also occur, which is when “food stops moving through because it gets stuck,” Parrella said. Dehydration and a lack of movement of the gut can cause this food pileup, Parrella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all health issues that require immediate medical attention, but confusingly, the signs of these problems often overlap with some of the less serious side effects of GLP-1s — vomiting, nausea, indigestion and more — both doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also this very small but serious risk of what’s called gastroparesis, which is basically where your stomach stops moving the food forward,” Parrella said. This is a permanent issue that isn’t fixed when someone stops taking the medication, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="There is currently litigation" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;There is currently litigation&lt;/a&gt; around this issue and lots of medical concerns, as it’s hard to predict who this may happen to, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;GLP-1 medications such as Wegovy and Ozempic can cause side effects including vomiting, nausea, gum disease and more.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can cause dental decay and gum disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elizabeth Walton" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Walton&lt;/a&gt;, clinical director at &lt;a href="https://risasdental.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Risas Kids Dental" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://risasdental.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Risas Kids Dental&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to dental health, the most common side effects of the use of GLP-1s are an increase in gum disease and dental decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications reduce saliva production. “Patients taking GLP-1s often experience symptoms of dry mouth, which include increased cavities and periodontal disease,” Walton told HuffPost via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Saliva produces a protective barrier over our teeth and lubricates our [gums],” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With less saliva in our mouths, we are more exposed to the acids created by bacteria that lead to gum disease and dental cavities,” noted Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any side effects, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my patients if they have vomiting even once, they should call my office because vomiting can be a symptom of some of the other more dangerous adverse effects,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or get worse, you should certainly tell your doctor, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the side effects of these medications are sometimes talked about among those on GLP-1s, it doesn’t make them normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people will say, ‘I’m just going to suck it up. I know nausea is normal,’ or ‘I know it’s common to have constipation on these meds. This is probably no big deal. It’s just how these meds work,’ or ‘I’m worried my doctor will stop prescribing this medicine for me if I complain’ ... and that’s when it becomes a problem,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When symptoms continue or worsen, it’s a sign from the body that something is wrong, she noted. “And when we ignore that, or don’t report, it then becomes very difficult to prevent the longer, more serious problems,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To combat some of these symptoms, you should follow a few rules when taking this medication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you focus on drinking lots of fluids and staying hydrated as you take GLP-1s, Parrella said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, you should prioritize your protein intake so you can maintain and build muscle as you are on the medication, she said. To further help muscle growth and maintenance, add strength training to your workout regimen, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then the third thing would be, because this slows the movement of food through the gut, you want to make sure you stop eating three [to four] hours before bedtime,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lie down after eating, it’s easy for the food to come back up and cause issues like heartburn and acid reflux, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t long-term research on GLP-1s, so some of the risks are unknown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important if somebody does start experiencing some new symptoms of any kind on these medications, we have to remember we don’t have very long-term data on these meds, so there are still a lot of unknown risks with these medications,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do they cause cancer? What happens if you stop? Does it cause a metabolic rebound? What about interactions with populations outside of those who have been tested?” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medical professionals are excited about understanding this new space in medicine, it’s also important that those who use GLP-1s remain cautious and informed of the risks, benefits and proper usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You also have to pay attention to the effect on your own body. So, if you don’t feel good, or you are having symptoms of any kind, be in communication with your doctor so that you have a partner in the process,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you should consider the risk versus the benefit when it comes to GLP-1s (and all medications), Lofton said. “This comes into play when we think about people who aren’t having a weight condition,” Lofton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as "brain fog," which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people's ability to work and perform daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it's difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; on October 1, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) -- key molecules for memory and learning -- based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study's findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team's analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. "&lt;em&gt;By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID,&lt;/em&gt;" remarks Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. "&lt;em&gt;Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder&lt;/em&gt;," concludes Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the team's findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study from Scripps Research offers an important clue: a small midline brain region plays a key role in how animals learn to continue drinking to avoid the stress and misery of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science&lt;/em&gt; on August 5, 2025, the Scripps Research team zeroed in on a set of brain cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in rats. They found that this region becomes more active, driving strong relapse behavior, when rats learn to associate environmental stimuli with the easing of withdrawal symptoms by alcohol. By illuminating this brain pathway, the research sheds light on one of the most stubborn features of addiction -- drinking not for pleasure, but to escape pain -- and could eventually lead to new treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) as well as other maladaptive behaviors including anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes addiction so hard to break is that people aren't simply chasing a high," says Friedbert Weiss, professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research and senior author of the study. "They're also trying to get rid of powerful negative states, like the stress and anxiety of withdrawal. This work shows us which brain systems are responsible for locking in that kind of learning, and why it can make relapse so persistent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This brain region just lit up in every rat that had gone through withdrawal-related learning," says co-senior author Hermina Nedelescu of Scripps Research. "It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress -- and that could be a game-changer in how we think about relapse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From behavior to brain maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 14.5 million people in the United States have alcohol use disorder, which encompasses a range of unhealthy drinking behaviors. Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterized by cycles of withdrawal, abstinence and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Weiss and Nedelescu used rats to study the types of learning that happen in the brain throughout this cycle. When rats initially begin drinking, they learn to associate pleasure with alcohol and seek more. However, that conditioning becomes far stronger during multiple cycles of withdrawal and relapse. After learning that alcohol eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal -- what scientists call negative reinforcement or a relief of 'negative hedonic state' -- the animals sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even when uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or contexts with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli -even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking," says Weiss. "That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behavior is punished."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new work, the team wanted to pin down exactly what networks of cells in the brain were responsible for learning to associate environmental cues with the relief of this negative hedonic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used advanced imaging tools to scan entire rat brains, cell by cell, and pinpoint areas that became more active in response to alcohol-related cues. They compared four groups of rats: those that had gone through withdrawal and learned that alcohol relieves a negative hedonic state, and three different control groups that had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several brain areas showed increased activity in the withdrawal-learned rats, one stood out: the PVT, which is known for its role in stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In retrospect, this makes a lot of sense," says Nedelescu. "The unpleasant effects of alcohol withdrawal are strongly associated with stress, and alcohol is providing relief from the agony of that stressful state."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that this negative hedonic state, and the activation of the PVT in the brain as a response, is critical for how the brain learns and perpetuates addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A better understanding of addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the new study extend well beyond alcohol, the researchers say. Environmental stimuli conditioned to negative reinforcement -- the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress -- is a universal feature of the brain, and can drive human behavior beyond substance use disorders such as anxiety disorders, fear-conditioning and traumatic avoidance learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles," says Nedelescu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will zoom in even further. Nedelescu and colleagues at Scripps Research want to expand the study to females and to study neurochemicals released in the PVT when subjects encounter environments associated with the experience of this relief from a negative hedonic state. If they can pinpoint molecules that are involved, it could open new avenues for drug development by targeting those molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the new study underscores a key shift in how basic scientists think about addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about chasing pleasure -- it's about escaping those negative hedonic states," says Weiss. "This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to Weiss and Nedelescu, authors of the study, "Recruitment of Neuronal Populations in the Paraventricular Thalamus of Alcohol Seeking Rats with Withdrawal-related Learning Experience," are Elias Meamari, Nami Rajaei, Alexus Grey, Ryan Bullard, and Nobuyoshi Suto of Scripps; and Nathan O'Connor of MBF Bioscience. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying active and independent well into the future starts with strong bones. Your skeleton does more than give your body structure—it protects vital organs and makes every movement possible, from daily errands to new adventures. Bone health isn’t just a concern for older adults; it matters for everyone. The strength you build earlier in life directly affects how your bones age and your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of osteoporosis later on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile and more prone to fractures, which can severely limit independence. In fact, breaks caused by osteoporosis are among the leading causes of disability in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many daily habits can help safeguard your bones in the long term, but experts strongly urge one change in particular: quitting smoking. We spoke with orthopedists to explain why breaking this habit is one of the most effective ways to prevent osteoporosis, along with other expert tips for keeping your bones healthy and resilient.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When asked about the top lifestyle change for bone health, experts have a clear answer. “The No. 1 habit I tell people to break is smoking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.resilienceorthopedics.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pamela Mehta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; While most people know that smoking harms the heart and lungs, its devastating effects on the skeletal system are often overlooked. Research consistently links tobacco use to decreased bone density—the primary cause of osteoporosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that smokers face a significantly higher risk of fractures compared to nonsmokers, and the longer you smoke, the greater your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The damage isn’t just a long-term concern; it directly affects your body’s ability to maintain a healthy skeleton. “I’ve seen otherwise healthy, active people develop brittle bones far earlier than expected simply because of long-term smoking,” says Mehta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a closer look at why smoking is so harmful for your bone health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Disrupts Bone-Building Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your bones are constantly undergoing a process called bone remodeling, in which old bone is broken down and replaced with new bone. This delicate balance is managed by two cells: osteoclasts, which break down bone, and osteoblasts, which build it up. Smoking disrupts this balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes interfere with how your body builds and maintains bone, essentially speeding up bone loss,” Mehta explains. Essentially, smoking increases the activity of osteoclasts while slowing down osteoblasts, leading to a net loss of bone mass and weaker bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy bones rely on a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients, delivered through the bloodstream. Chemicals in cigarettes—especially nicotine—cause blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow throughout the body, including to your bones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This diminished circulation means your skeleton may not receive enough vital building blocks, such as oxygen, calcium, phosphorus and other essential nutrients needed to stay strong. As a result, bone remodeling slows, leaving bones weaker and more porous.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The negative effects of smoking aren’t limited to long-term bone loss—they also create immediate challenges when an injury occurs. “Tobacco use inhibits bone formation and bone turnover, which contributes to delayed bone healing when a fracture occurs,” according to &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/lori-fitton" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lori Fitton, Ph.D., APRN, CNP, CCD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is one reason why quitting smoking is often required before certain medical procedures. “Many orthopedic surgeons require a patient to be tobacco-free before an elective orthopedic surgery will be scheduled because tobacco use delays healing and increases the probability of postoperative infections,” Fitton adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The message is clear and stark: “Tobacco use is bad for all bones, whether they are healing bones or growing bones,” warns Fitton.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take for your skeleton, but other habits also play a role in building strong bones. Experts say these lifestyle adjustments can further reduce your risk of osteoporosis while supporting overall skeletal health:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Calcium and Vitamin D.&lt;/strong&gt; Calcium is the main mineral in your bones, and vitamin D helps your body absorb it. Include calcium-rich foods like dairy products, leafy greens and fortified foods, and vitamin D sources such as fatty fish, certain mushrooms and fortified milk. Some people may need supplements to meet their needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Protein. &lt;/strong&gt;Protein not only builds muscle but it also strengthens bones. Aim to eat high-quality protein at every meal and snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in Weight-Bearing Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Gravity-resisting activities stress your bones, triggering them to grow stronger. Include resistance training (body-weight exercises, weight lifting) and impact exercise (jumping jacks, skipping, jogging, sports involving vertical jumps) at least two or three times per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit or Avoid Alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive alcohol intake can reduce calcium and vitamin D absorption and disrupt hormones that protect bones. Limit alcohol consumption to one drink per day for women and two for men—or skip it entirely for stronger bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bone health matters at every age. While some factors—like genetics—are beyond your control, the habits you build today may directly influence your skeletal strength tomorrow. One of the most important changes you can make is quitting smoking. Smoking interferes with your body’s natural bone-building processes, limits nutrient delivery and slows healing, all of which increase your risk of osteoporosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To further protect your bones, focus on a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, stay active with regular weight-bearing exercise and limit alcohol intake. By taking proactive steps now, you’ll build a stronger foundation to support an active, independent and vibrant life for years to come.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christine Wu Nordahl, senior study author and principal investigator at the UC Davis MIND Institute, said: 'This is not about finding a single cause. It's about recognizing the whole child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Supporting gastrointestinal health is one important step toward improving overall quality of life for children with autism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 31 children in the US is diagnosed with autism, a stark increase from about one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in August in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613251362349#sec-2"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 475 children also enrolled in the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project. Of those, 322 (68 percent) were diagnosed with autism, while the remainder were neurotypical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The children were evaluated at three points: baseline (two to four years old), two years later (four to six years old) and 'middle childhood' (nine to 12 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers completed questionnaires about their children's potential gastrointestinal symptoms, including how often they had abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, bloating, constipation, pain during a bowel movement, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in the stool or blood in the vomit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents and caregivers ranked the frequency of each symptom from one to five (ranging from 'never' to 'always'). Children with at least one current GI symptom (within the last three months) were labelled as having gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants formally diagnosed with a digestive condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants with autism, 43 had reported food allergies, which may have contributed to their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those who are typically developing (TD) reporting digestive issues at different points in the study. Autistic children showed a greater likelihood throughout the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that 61 percent of neurotypical children never reported GIS compared to 34.5 percent of children with ASD, a 55 percent difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the initial baseline visit, 47 percent of autistic children reported GIS compared to 30 percent of typically developing participants, making children with autism 44 percent more likely to have gastrointestinal issues at this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the second visit, 40 percent of autistic children had GIS compared to 15 percent of those in the neurotypical group,  a difference of 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after the third visit, GIS was recorded in 30 percent of children with autism and seven percent of neurotypical children, more than a four-fold difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each individual gastrointestinal symptom was more common in children with autism than their neurotypical peers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constipation was the most common symptom in the autistic group, with 32 percent of participants reporting it compared to 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the neurotypical group, the most common symptom was abdominal pain, seen in 12 percent of patients. Among those with autism, abdominal pain was seen in 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diarrhea was the second most common symptom in each group, accounting for 27 percent of children with autism and 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the predicted probability of children in the ASD and TD groups developing gastrointestinal issues as they age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that over time, children with autism were twice as likely as their neurotypical peers to develop gastrointestinal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted autistic children with more gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely to have more profound autistic behaviors like repetitive behaviors, anxiety, depression, aggression, defiance, social problems and sleep issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not explain why gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in autistic children, but it could be because many of them only eat a select few 'safe' foods, which generally are fried, low in fiber and highly processed, increasing the risk of bloating, constipation and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autistic people also often have imbalances in their gut bacteria, which may increase the chances of digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Results support the need for future research to assess the presence of and persistence of GIS in children with autism throughout childhood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They could save your life. For years I've seen how heart attacks can turn a family's world upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the saddest part is in many cases the body has already given signals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;1. Frequent nausea and dizziness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the red flags she highlighted are frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have a clear cause like pregnancy, medications, or an infection, it's time to see a doctor,' Dr Yang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion, are early warning signs for heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/blog/5-warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack-you-may-not-know"&gt;Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;2. Extreme fatigue and constant headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common but overlooked sign is extreme fatigue and persistent headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yang warned this isn't the usual tiredness from work or parenting, but a strange exhaustion that lingers even after proper rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it's accompanied by headaches that worsen over time, she said, it could be an early indicator of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead lifestyle-ccox"&gt;3. Numbness on one side of the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do you suddenly feel like your arm, leg, or half of your face is falling asleep? This could be reduced blood flow or even a sign your heart isn't pumping as it should,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the Heart Foundation, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, numbness, especially if it affects one side of the body, is also a common symptom of a stroke, which also results from interrupted blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;4. Sudden change in vision &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, a sudden change in vision - double vision, blurriness or one eye suddenly failing to focus - may indicate a blocked blood vessel and should be treated as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling has been described as 'a curtain falling across one eye' and occurs because the blood flow disruptions form clots or plaque build up which affect the retina or the brain's visual centres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation stresses that someone in Australia is hospitalised with a heart attack every nine minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chest pain and shortness of breath are widely known symptoms, many Australians - particularly women - experience subtler signs such as dizziness, nausea, jaw or back pain, or feeling sweaty and unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may even suffer a silent heart attack, with no obvious symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs can appear alone or together, and often last at least 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may come on suddenly or build gradually, which is why experts say any unusual or unexplained symptom should be checked without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The good news is there are ways to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation recommends quitting smoking, exercising regularly, following a heart-healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol, managing stress, and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with diabetes, keeping blood sugar under control is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women should also be mindful of specific risk factors such as PCOS, pregnancy complications, early menopause, autoimmune diseases, and hormone treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professional advice is simple: listen to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible to experience several of these symptoms or just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If something feels off, don't ignore it. The earlier you act, the better your chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 04:15:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>现有药物结合起来对抗世界上最常见的肝病-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/existing-drugs-combine-to-fight-worlds-most-common-liver-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 03:41:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOOWZ0UEp4a3BpVHRjYV9UdDhGQUx4Y29UUXVKSjhfOGg5WUxJZDA4bU9reHZQZlYyMTBBU2hCdjJSbU1BNTNCUjNFVksxTnhfMUdLaHF2Rjl0NWg5Rlg4bVJCT2hsQjFpQXE0OVBFbDFwbmN4RTl6SkY1N1dsUHdEd2RUM1NZY0t2N2JzZGtBaFJibGVQ</guid></item><item><title>这种新疗法能让数百万美国人平静下来吗？ -加州大学旧金山分校</title><link>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/10/430796/could-novel-therapy-calm-anxiety-millions-americans</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_narrow"&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder affects 1 in 20 U.S. adults. Those with serious symptoms may isolate themselves to the point they rarely leave their home and are unable to work and build meaningful relationships. Standard medications may make little difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCSF neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jennifer.mitchell"&gt;Jennifer Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, develops novel therapeutics for drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, stress, anxiety, impulsivity, and depression. She believes there’s a treatment that can do more. So far, this experimental drug has shown surprising results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this mystery treatment? It’s the pharmaceutical formulation of LSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What is generalized anxiety disorder? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder is a form of chronic anxiety that seems disproportionate to the actual events promoting that anxiety. It interferes with life on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may have difficulty concentrating, retaining information, and making decisions, so it can be challenging to find and maintain a job, and deal with managing a home and parenting. They may suffer from depression secondary to anxiety and feel restless, keyed up, and easily fatigued. They may be reluctant to leave home because they fear situations where they could feel trapped, helpless, or humiliated.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is it different from day-to-day anxiety?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder is that it manifests as physical symptoms. Persistent worry activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, triggering stress hormones that cause physical effects. Patients may have muscle tension and rapid breathing, and report symptoms like headaches and insomnia, ringing in the ears, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is generalized anxiety disorder treated? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s usually treated with medications like Zoloft and Paxil that boost and stabilize the neurotransmitter serotonin, leading to reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional well-being. These medications have been found to reduce symptoms by an average of 1.25 points on the 56-point anxiety scale — insufficient to make significant difference for at least some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Why LSD?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSD as well as other psychedelics, have tremendous potential to shift mood and emotions when used in a controlled, therapeutic setting. We have seen this in a previous trial of Ecstasy to treat PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical formulation of LSD is MM120. Its primary mechanism is to promote neuroplasticity in the brain, potentially altering negative thought patterns. It also increases communication between brain regions that may address the rigid thinking that underlies GAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How effective is MM120?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier phase of the study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838505"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of a single dose of MM120 were evaluated over a 12-week period in approximately 200 participants with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder. The drug significantly alleviated symptoms, reducing them by five to six points on the anxiety scale in addition to the effects of placebo. That’s quite significant and enough to reclassify moderate generalized anxiety disorder as mild in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Were there side effects? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were carefully monitored by medical staff during the period after the drug was administered. Side effects were generally mild or moderate and included hallucinations, visual distortions, nausea, and headache. It’s important to note, these were more prevalent using the highest dosage — which we will not be using since it was found to be no more effective. Nausea is a common side effect with psychedelics, but this was reduced by restricting participants to a light breakfast and treating them proactively with an anti-nausea medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What challenges do you face recruiting participants for the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for people with moderate-to-severe general anxiety disorder, so typically those with disabling symptoms who are reluctant to leave their home. Ironically, people who would best qualify are least likely to show up. Participants are screened by very skilled clinicians who probe and observe body language and carefully build a rapport. We hope this builds trust and enables participants to be vulnerable and reflective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn More about MM120 trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in participating in MM120 trial sites at UCSF and other California locations, please check &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/trial/NCT06741228"&gt;this information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details about more MM120 trial sites can be found &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06809595"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today said a case of mumps has been confirmed in an individual on Hawaii island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said this case is community-acquired, and not travel-related, suggesting that mumps may currently be circulating on the island. Officials are working with the individual’s family, health care providers and Hawaii County officials to identify close contacts and prevent further spread. Officials declined to specify whether the individual is an adult or child due to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, officials want the public to know the individual attended an event at Harold H. Higashihara Park in Kailua-Kona from 4:30 and 6 p.m. on Sept. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who attended this even should contact DOH for guidance, and monitor themselves for symptoms until Oct. 20, which is 25 days after exposure. Anyone who develops symptoms should isolate for five days after symptom onset, and avoid contact with others, especially infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with suspected mumps should also call ahead before visiting a clinic or hospital to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/mumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mumps &lt;/a&gt;is a contagious viral illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, talking, or sharing items such as cups or eating utensils.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms — which typically appear 12 to 25 days after exposure — include swollen, painful salivary glands, which result in puffy cheeks or a tender jaw; fever; headache; muscle aches; tiredness; and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said there is no specific treatment for mumps, and that care focuses on rest, fluids, and fever control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most people who fall ill with mumps recover fully, DOH said, it can cause serious illness in some, including inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, pancreatitis, encephalitis, meningitis, and loss of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While mumps is preventable with vaccination, even one case is concerning because of how easily the virus spreads,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble in the news release. “We encourage all Hawaii residents to check their vaccination records and ensure they and their families are fully protected with two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine by age 6, while adults born in or after 1957 should have documentation of vaccination or a blood test showing immunity. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure may need an additional MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii experienced a significant mumps outbreak from March 2017 through October 2018, with 1,009 confirmed cases statewide. Most cases were on Oahu, but also occurred on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By the age of 30, adults typically lose between 3% and 8% of muscle mass, with the rate accelerating each decade. After 60, muscle loss can reach up to 15%. While this natural decline may feel inevitable, research shows that strength training can counteract it, improving health, mobility, and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, evidence suggests that “just like heart-pumping aerobic exercise, strength training also may help older adults live longer” (Harvard Health). Maintaining strong muscles supports posture, balance, and metabolic health, which collectively contribute to healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Simple Workouts for Effective Muscle Building | Enhance Strength and Endurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="22788980" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="squats" source="keywords"&gt;Squats&lt;/keyword&gt;: The body weight exercise experts recommend&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to lift heavy weights to enjoy these benefits. Body weight exercises can effectively maintain and build muscle mass, and among them, squats stand out. Squats engage multiple muscle groups, stimulate the cardiovascular system, and improve neuromotor and skeletal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also help prevent age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), strengthen bones, improve balance, reduce fall risk, and enhance insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Ramirez, director at Viding Castellana in Madrid, told Vogue: “If we start in childhood or youth, we get a more solid musculoskeletal formation and a strength base that will protect us all our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even starting squats later in life can offer significant benefits, helping maintain independence and functional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How squats support &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing squats alone doesn’t guarantee a longer lifespan, they contribute to living stronger, more mobile, and more independent lives. Maintaining muscle strength after 50 helps protect against age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. As Harvard Health notes, the combination of aerobic and resistance training- including simple body weight exercises- can be a powerful tool for healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal isn’t merely to extend lifespan but to enhance quality of life. Squats, along with other forms of strength training, equip the body to handle daily tasks, maintain independence, and reduce the risk of injuries or chronic diseases. In short, integrating squats into a regular fitness routine can help ensure that your later years are not only longer but healthier and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 01:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家使用纳米颗粒逆转小鼠的阿尔茨海默氏症- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-scientists-reverse-alzheimer-mice-nanoparticles.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), working with partners in the UK, has demonstrated a nanotechnology strategy that reverses Alzheimer's disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach employs nanoparticles that are bioactive in their own right: "supramolecular drugs." The work has been published in &lt;i&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting neurons directly, the therapy restores the proper function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the vascular gatekeeper that regulates the brain's environment. By repairing this critical interface, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer's pathology in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most expensive organ of the body, consuming 20% of the energy in adults and up to 60% in children. This energy arrives through a vast blood supply, assured by a unique and dense vascular system where each neuron is nourished by one capillary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain contains approximately one billion capillaries, highlighting the vital role of brain vasculature in maintaining health and combating disease. These findings highlight the crucial role of vascular health, especially in diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's, where a compromised vascular system is closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBB is a cellular and physiological barrier that separates the brain from the blood flow to protect it from external dangers such as pathogens or toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team demonstrated that targeting a specific mechanism enables undesirable "waste proteins" produced in the brain to pass through this barrier and be eliminated in the blood flow. In Alzheimer's disease, the main "waste" protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation impairs the normal functioning of the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used mouse models that are genetically programmed to produce larger amounts of Aβ protein and develop a significant cognitive decline mimicking Alzheimer's pathology. They administered only three doses of the supramolecular drugs and afterward regularly monitored the evolution of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Only one hour after the injection, we observed a reduction of 50–60% in Aβ amount inside the brain," explains Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and Ph.D. student at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking data were the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of the animals and measure their memory decline over several months, covering all stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the experiments, they treated a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60-year-old human) with the nanoparticles and analyzed its behavior after six months. The result was impressive: the animal, aged 18 months (comparable to a 90-year-old human), had recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance," said Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC, Principal Investigator of the Molecular Bionics Group and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Amyloid-β clearance from the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, one of the key problems is that the brain's natural clearance system for toxic species like amyloid-β stops working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper: it recognizes Aβ, binds to it through ligands, and ferries it across the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood-brain+barrier/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; into the bloodstream, where it can be removed. But this system is fragile. If LRP1 binds too much Aβ too tightly, the transport clogs and the protein itself gets degraded inside the brain barrier cells, leaving fewer LRP1 "carriers" available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it binds too little, the signal is too weak to trigger transport. In both cases, the result is the same: Aβ builds up inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supramolecular drugs developed in this work act like a switch that resets the system. By mimicking the ligands of LRP1, they can bind to Aβ, cross the blood–brain barrier, and initiate the process of removing toxic species from the brain. In doing so, they help restore the vasculature's natural role as a waste-clearing pathway and bring it back to proper function.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nanoparticles to treat Alzheimer's&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers introduce nanoparticles that act as supramolecular drugs, therapeutic agents in their own right rather than carriers of medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed with a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, these nanoparticles combine precise size control with a defined number of surface ligands, creating a multivalent platform able to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific way. By engaging receptor trafficking at the cell membrane, they open up a unique and novel way to modulate receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This precision not only enables the effective clearance of amyloid-β from the brain but also restores balance to the vascular system that maintains healthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative therapeutic paradigm offers a promising pathway for developing effective clinical interventions, addressing vascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer's pathology," concludes Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at the Molecular Bionics group from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a collaboration among the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC), West China Hospital of Sichuan University, West China Xiamen Hospital of Sichuan University, University College London, the Xiamen Key Laboratory of Psychoradiology and Neuromodulation, University of Barcelona, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).&lt;/p&gt;

The mixture was left to evaporate, allowing the organic solvent to completely dissipate and form a homogeneous polymer film at the bottom of the vial. PBS solution was added to rehydrate the polymer film and sonicated for 30 min. The solution was stirred continuously for 7 days at 4 °C via a magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm. The morphology of the A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs was characterized via transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100Plus, Japan). The diameter distribution was assessed via dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer Pro, UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec6"&gt;Animals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the West China Hospital Animal Care Committee (IACUC-approved project number: 20211475A). Considerable efforts were made to minimize the number of animals utilized in these studies and to alleviate any pain or discomfort experienced by the animals. In all the experiments, the animals were housed in a room where the temperature was regulated, with consistent alternating cycles of light and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec7"&gt;Immunohistochemistry (IHC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) of mouse brain tissue were deparaffinized with xylene and subjected to gradient alcohol hydration (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched via the addition of 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (room temperature, 10 min) following antigen retrieval (Biosharp, 22315828). The tissues were blocked with 1% BSA (Aladdin, A104912) at room temperature for 30 min. Aβ-targeting primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C (Servicebio, GB13414-1, 1:200), followed by washing with PBS. The sections were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (ABclonal, AS014, 1:150) at ambient temperature for 30 min and subsequently washed with PBS. DAB substrate (Elabscience, E-IR-R101, 1:20) was applied for 5 min, followed by hematoxylin solution (Servicebio, G1004) for 1 min and hematoxylin differentiation solution (Servicebio, G1039) for 10−15 s. The sections were immediately rinsed in running tap water for 20 s, treated with hematoxylin bluing buffer (Servicebio, G1040) for 1 min, and washed with PBS. Finally, the slides were mounted with quick-drying neutral resin (ZSZSGBBIO, ZLI-9516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec8"&gt;Aβ extraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following euthanasia via an overdose of isoflurane anesthesia, cardiac perfusion was conducted with cold PBS. The entire brain tissue was subsequently harvested and weighed. The brain tissues were subjected to comprehensive homogenization (Servicebio, KZ-5F-3D) employing a TBS solution enriched with phosphatase inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2302054) and protease inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2306008) at 70 Hz and −20 °C. The supernatant was segregated after the brain tissue homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C via an ultrahigh-speed centrifuge (Beckman, Optima MAX-XP). The sediment were subsequently resuspended in 70% formic acid (Aopusheng (Tianjin) Chemical, 20210610) and centrifuged at 100,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C for 1 h, after which the resulting supernatant was collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Vessel extraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following euthanasia via isoflurane overdose anesthesia, cardiac perfusion was conducted with cold PBS, then brain tissues were excised and weighed. The tissues were processed via vascular parenchyma isolation buffer comprising 10 mM HEPES (Servicebio, CR2207064), 141 mM NaCl (Aladdin, 111549), 4 mM KCl (Aladdin, P112134), 2.8 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, C290953), 1 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, M433513), 1 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, S433623), and 10 mM glucose (Servicebio, CR2112094). To 500 μL of brain tissue homogenate, 1 mL of 26% (w/w) dextran (Next Sage, 61212ES60) was added. Following thorough mixing and a resting period of 15 min at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged (15,800 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 15 min, 4 °C). The upper layer subsequently represented the parenchymal fraction, and the lower layer corresponded to the vascular fraction. The vascular fraction was washed with PBS 2 × 5 min for further detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parenchyma and blood vessels underwent comprehensive homogenization using a tissue lysis mixture (Yase, 016c1050) enriched with a phosphatase inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2302054) and a protease inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2306008) at 70 Hz and −20 °C. The tissues were allowed to fully lyse at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected via centrifugation at 14,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentrations of various proteins, including LRP1 (NOVUS, NBP3-00449), PACSIN2 (Anruike, YX-160103M), Rab5 (abbexa, abx154598), and Aβ (Invitrogen, KMB3441), were determined via ELISA kits following the manufacturer’s protocols. For Aβ in the blood, the test was performed directly according to the ELISA instructions. Aβ extracted by formic acid needs to be neutralized with Tris base before testing. Protein concentrations were calculated on the basis of the curve equation (four-parameter fit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Confocal imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confocal images were captured via a Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope equipped with Diode 405, Argon, DPSS 561, and HeNe633 lasers. Imaging was conducted at a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels and a scanning speed of ×100. Colocalization analysis to derive PCC (r) was performed via the colocalization plug-in for ImageJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;STED imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;STED nanoscopy experiments were performed under a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP8 STED-ONE uni. The dyes (TSA570, TSA620 and TSA750) were excited under an STED laser. The emission signals were collected via HyD reflected light detectors. The depletion beam was applied at wavelengths of 592 nm, 660 nm, and 775 nm (50% power), with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels and a scanning speed of ×100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) stain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse brain tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through gradient alcohol dehydration. Following antigen retrieval, 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was utilized to inactivate endogenous peroxidase (Biosarp, 22315828) for 10 min. Permeabilization of the sections at room temperature for 10 min was achieved with 1% Triton X-100 (Biofroxx, 1139ML100). The sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 10 min. Subsequent to a PBS rinse, the TSA fluorescent solution (Absin, abs50031) was applied and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was subsequently conducted. The aforementioned steps were repeated with distinct primary antibodies, including antibodies against LRP1 (ABclonal, A1439, 1:100), Aβ (Servicebio, GB13414-1, 1:200), CD31 (Cell Signaling, 77699, 1:300), Rab5 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-88260, 1:200) and CD146 (Abcam, ab75769, 1:300). Various wavelengths of TSA, including the TSA520, TSA570, TSA620, and TSA700 dyes, until multimeric fluorescence staining was achieved. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Solarbio, C0065) for 5 min and then sealed with antiquenching sealing agent (Solarbio, S2100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;APP/PS1 POs (12-month-old) mice were injected intravenously with the commercial Aβ radiocontrast agent [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] AV-45 (2.8–3.2 MBq). Then, intracranial images of the mice were acquired via a micro-PET-CT imager (Inviscan, France) according to operation specifications. After a recovery period, saline (200 μL) was intravenously injected into wild-type mice (3- and 12-month-old) and sham APP/PS1 mice (12 months old). The APP/PS1 POs were intravenously injected with 200 μL of A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs (10 g/L). After 12 h, all the mice were intravenously injected with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] AV-45 (2.8–3.2 MBq). Intracranial images of the mice were acquired via the same imager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Hematoxylin‒eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice tissue sections (5 μm) were dewaxed and rehydrated. The sections were stained with hematoxylin solution for 5 min, immediately rinsed in running tap water for 10–15 s, followed by incubation with hematoxylin differentiation solution (Servicebio, G1039) for 10–15 s. Subsequently, the sections were treated with hematoxylin bluing solution (Servicebio, G1040) for 30 s and washed in running tap water. The sections were then stained with eosin staining solution for 30 s, followed by washing with ethanol. The slides were dehydrated through a gradient of ethanol (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%) and xylene. Seal the sections with quick-drying neutral resin (ZSZSGBBIO, ZLI-9516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Tissue clearing and staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse brain were treated with 1/2 CUBIC-L solution (80 mL Milli-Q, 5 g Triton X-100, and 5 g N-butyldiethanolamine (Aladdin, 102-79-4)) at 37 °C for 6 h. Then, the solution was replaced with a CUBIC-L solution and incubated at 37 °C for 15 days, with the new CUBIC-L solution being replaced every 2 days. The brain tissues were subsequently washed three times with staining buffer (1.5 M NaCl). The hyalinized brains were transferred to staining buffer containing a vasculature probe (Vector, DL-1178-1, 1:100) and an Aβ probe (Abcam, ab216983, 100 nM) for fluorescence staining (RT, 3 days). The refractive index was adjusted via a CUBIC-M solution (25 g Milli-Q, 45 g antipyrine (Aladdin, 60-80-0), 30 g N-methylnicotinamide (Aladdin, 114-33-0), and 125 μl of N-butyldiethanolamine)). Images were analyzed via Amira and iMaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donepezil HCl (Aladdin, D129948) was dissolved and added to a polymer film preparing donepezil HCl@A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, followed by dialysis using a 3 kDa dialysis bag for 7 days. The concentration of donepezil HCl in the dialysis fluid was measured to calculate the encapsulation efficiency. Sodium 1-decanesulfonate (Aladdin, S100284) was dissolved in pure water (15.7416 mM/L) and filtered. Chromatographic grade acetonitrile solution and perchloric acid were added, followed by ultrasonication for 10 min. Standard solutions of donepezil HCl at concentrations of 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.625, and 7.8125 μg/mL were prepared. The content of donepezil HCl was detected via an Agilent-1260 chromatograph at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, a column temperature of 35 °C, a volume of 20 μl, and a detection signal at 271 nm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Morris water maze (MWM) experiment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each group, the mice were administered a caudal vein injection daily (A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, donepezil@A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, donepezil, or saline), which was continued for three days. The mice were subsequently housed in a standard rearing environment for seven days to acclimatize and recover. For the analysis, the pool was segmented into four quadrants. From days 11 to 14 (days 375–378 of lifespan), a platform was positioned in quadrant II, and the animals were introduced into the thermostatic pool from each quadrant daily, with time taken by the mice to locate the platform recorded as escape latency. If the mice failed to reach the platform within 120 s, they were guided to it and remained there for 30 s. A spatial probe (Stage II) was performed on day 15 (day 379 of lifespan). Once the platform was removed, the mice were placed in the water from the IV quadrant. The results of the spatial probe were expressed as either the percentage of time the mice remained at the original escape platform location or the number of times they passed. Reverse place navigation trials were conducted from days 16 to 19 (day 380–383 of lifespan), with the platform positioned in the IV quadrant which opposite the original platform location. The animals repeated the regimen from days 11 to 14, and the reverse escape latency was documented. On day 20 (day 384 of lifespan), the platform was removed, and the mice were introduced into the water from quadrant II. The results of the reverse spatial probe are expressed as either the percentage of time that the animal spent on the original platform position or the number of times it crossed the location. In addition, 6 months later, the mice were subjected to place navigation (stage V) and spatial probe (stage VI) experiments again with the same methods and conditions. Animal performance was recorded by the same tracking system (EthoVision XT, Noldus Information Technology) for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Sucrose preference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Stage IV and Stage VI, the sucrose preference of the sham, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 POs was tested. Each mouse was housed individually and allowed to acclimatize to the cage, which contained two bottles of standard pure water, for 2 days. One of the bottles was subsequently filled with 2% sucrose solution. The amount of water consumed by the mice was recorded, and the water in each bottle was refreshed daily. Sucrose preference = Sucrose water consumption/(Sucrose water consumption + Standard purified water consumption) × 100%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Nest construction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days after the sucrose preference experiment, each mouse was housed individually and then adapted to a single-cage environment for 7 days. Subsequently, 10 pieces of paper (5 × 5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were added to each cage and evenly placed. After 4 days, the nesting test results were scored in accordance with the improved 4-point scoring system.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Guo, J.-W. et al.

Total protein concentrations were determined via a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Biosharp, BL520A). The samples were diluted in 1× sample buffer and 5× master mix (ProteinSimple) to a final loading concentration of 1 μg/μL, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. They were then loaded into wells at a volume of 3 μL per well. Denatured samples, blocking buffer, primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jess modular antibodies, ProteinSimple), wash buffer, and chemiluminescent substrate (1:1 luminol-peroxidase mixture) were sequentially loaded into the designated detection plate wells. The primary antibodies used included rabbit anti-CD31 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, #77699), anti-CD146 (1:50; Abmart, T55209), anti-NeuN (1:50; Abcam, ab177487), and anti-β-actin (1:300; Servicebio) antibodies. Automated capillary electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and signal acquisition were performed via the Jess system according to operation specifications. The data were analyzed with Compass for Simple Western software (v6.2, ProteinSimple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Proximity ligation assay (PLA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein‒protein interaction analysis was performed using the Duolink® PLA Kit (Sigma‒Aldrich; DUO96000 and DUO96040) strictly following the manufacturer’s operational protocol. The brain slices of the mice were pre-stained with TSA dye for pericytes (CD146, Abcam, ab75769), endothelial cells (CD31, Cell Signaling, 77699), and astrocytes (GFAP, Invitrogen, PA5-16291). After sodium azide neutralization pre-treatment, the antibodies, LRP1 (Abcam, ab92544), PACSIN2 (Invitrogen, PA5--99032), and Aβ (ABclonal, A24422), were conjugated to species-specific PLA probes (DUO96040). Subsequent procedures inclouding incubation, hybridization, ligation, amplification, and signal development—were conducted according to the kit’s standard protocol. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and images were acquired via confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:30:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBTR24tcnZpdTdXM0RBaWQtRERUUlBJOUxVMkhQTlVGc3N1cGRWRVFlRkV4Sk8zVTNaNlpVSjFIemcxVXZHVktMRnFIVk9tRy1qYnA3N3RlMnBib1MtamxF</guid></item><item><title>与ALS相关的开采化石燃料的暴露，新研究发现- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/exposure-mining-fossil-fuel-linked-als-new-research/story?id=126254429</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A major pollutant from mining fossil fuels has been linked to an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Longterm exposure to sulfur dioxide, a component produced by the combustion of oil-based fuel and coal, is associated with the development of the neurodegenerative disease, a paper published in &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125014835?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt; found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study began after healthcare workers at a provincial ALS clinic in New Brunswick, Canada, had been noticing a higher incidence rate of patients in the region, lead author Daniel Saucier, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec and lead author of the paper, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If there's so many cases in New Brunswick, you know, what's going on?

It is not clear whether the change O'Neill is calling for is possible or likely to come about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9aee9d" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said “standalone vaccinations can potentially reduce the risk of side effects and can maximize parental choice in childhood immunizations.” He did not offer evidence for his statement about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d349a2" class="body-graf"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been available as a combination shot since 1971, in part to reduce the number of injections that children receive, given that the three are administered at the same ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd4ee2" class="body-graf"&gt;Breaking up the MMR vaccine, a two-dose regimen in which the first shot is recommended at 12 to 15 months and the second at 4 to 6 years, would mean that children would receive six injections instead of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-bc1792"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1618" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg" alt="Vial of MMR vaccine."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;A vial of MMR vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fb9e2" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear where Trump’s advice came from. The White House is not responsible for setting vaccine or drug use recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21c9c3" class="body-graf"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;a White House event&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 22, the president expressed a preference for individual over combined shots while at the same time decrying the number of vaccines that kids receive, saying  that “too many different things are going into that baby at too big a number.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-417322" class="body-graf"&gt;“The MMR, I think, should be taken separately,” Trump said. “This is based on what I feel. ... It seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem. So there’s no downside in taking them separately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-743905" class="body-graf"&gt;Merck, the pharmaceutical company that has manufactured the MMR vaccine since 1971, said in a statement that use of individual vaccines “increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43658e" class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, the company added, “&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28881166/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!o46VHBzaZBbEGeQHqzVRFQHPxefAvu-TQ60Y-Blsho5Pqr0xSCQj7byRdXAjS9QqqkNVs3JKWXA13lvdXnvbk8DN9g$" target="_blank"&gt;evidence suggests &lt;/a&gt;that use of combination vaccines improves childhood vaccination outcomes, increasing both completion (receipt of all recommended doses) and compliance (age-appropriate administration) rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2d7b2" class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. has recorded more &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-minnesota-double-us-outbreaks-vaccine-continue-rcna235144" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; this year &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;than in any other since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, when the country eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e91783" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who in the past founded an anti-vaccine group, has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;made false claims&lt;/a&gt; about measles vaccines, including that they haven’t been “safety tested” and that their protection is short-lived. However, Kennedy has also said that people should get the vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4dc97b" class="body-graf"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has already moved to limit access to a combination MMR and chickenpox vaccine for children. The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee recommended on Sept. 18 against that vaccine for children under 4. O’Neill, who is also the deputy health secretary, signed off on the recommendation last week. (Most pediatricians already give young children the chickenpox vaccine and MMR vaccine separately.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d62db" class="body-graf"&gt;The committee’s recommendation was based on an increased risk of febrile seizures (seizures prompted by fevers that tend to resolve quickly), which doctors had known about for years. Combination MMR and chickenpox vaccines can still be given to older kids, since there is no evidence of an increased risk of febrile seizure in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d16282" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Trump said at the White House event days later that he was “very happy” that chickenpox vaccines would be administered separately from MMR vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 22:20:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOT3N3c1VQeFhNSEIzM291ZkVQNHJBZ1EwQ1BGLUhNRjFRYWRUZG9vRWhSVGtaVHgyaEh3Q0xFN0dFU2hVNm5IMlpiUC0tdjFkU0JsczRqQkJ0Q0VTYkJ2TWRaaHdzNTNlQ1duXzR0S2VYYWdib1NMeHlVOWdYWUh2MnZmY2NZMnQ3U0xlZzBuZEtUR0xYc2k2Y1psUUtZdlRvYWtTY21STEU4aDNRMkFKbzZ30gFWQVVfeXFMUEdreG9nNldRVUFOd0pzbWo5TGNyV2k5LWJTSVJNMmpFYXRRWE1JZi1yVFJ6bmlPY2U5UWV3R1VlOGlxUjlEN01IcDNhbEhEZ05LeUVYV0E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，每天只喝一罐健怡可乐或雪碧可使罹患致命肝病的风险高达60% --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15165803/sugar-drink-liver-disease-diet-masld-coke-sprite.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking just one can of fizzy drink per day—diet or full-fat—could dramatically raise the risk of developing deadly liver disease, concerning research today suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, MASLD occurs when excess fat builds up inside the liver, and it is said to be on the rise in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Chinese researchers have discovered just 250ml of fizzy drinks per day — less than one can — was enough to raise the risk of MASLD by up to 60 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, who analysed the diets of more than 123,000 British adults, found those who guzzled sugar-sweetened drinks like Coca-Cola had a 50 per cent increased likelihood of developing the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, low or non-sugar-sweetened drinks such as Diet Coke or Sprite Zero Sugar, raised the risk of MASLD by 60 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, today, said the findings suggested 'diet' alternatives could be more harmful to liver health than thought and urged health officials to 'reconsider' their role in healthy diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lihe Liu, a gastroenterology researcher at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, said: 'Sugar sweetened beverages have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that replacing either sugar sweetened or low or non-sugar-sweetened drinks with water, significantly reduced MASLD risk by 12.8 and 15.2 per cent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists believe this may be because sugar sweetened drinks dramatically affect blood glucose levels, while low or non-sugar sweetened drinks could alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The higher sugar content in sugar sweetened beverages can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation,' Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Low or non-sugar sweetened beverages, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings and even stimulating insulin secretion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research will be presented in full at the United European Gastroenterology annual congress in Berlin on October 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now aim to further investigate how sugar and its substitutes interact with the gut microbiome to influence liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates MASLD may now affect one in five people in the UK—though experts have warned the true figure could be as high as 40 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, around 80 per cent of those affected remain undiagnosed, as the disease often has no obvious symptoms—or it has symptoms that are mistaken for less serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, it is only spotted during routine blood tests or liver function tests carried out for unrelated issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Philip Newsome, Director of the Roger Williams Institute of Liver Studies at King's College London &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15087925/deadly-liver-disease-cause-treatment.html"&gt;previously told the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;: 'People who develop MASLD are often overweight or have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're seeing an increase in liver disease in the UK, and the challenge is that symptoms are often unnoticeable until it's too late.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that it's a common and dangerous misconception that only alcohol can cause liver scarring, as excess fat and uncontrolled blood sugar levels can lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A team of U.K. scientists reviewed data from clinical trials and found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2—the plant-based version&lt;/a&gt; often found in fortified foods and some supplements—may actually &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower levels of vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, the form your body naturally makes from sunlight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, raise fresh questions about whether the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;two versions of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; are interchangeable. Let’s break down what the researchers found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore how vitamin D2 might affect vitamin D3 levels, researchers from the University of Surrey, John Innes Centre and Quadram Institute Bioscience searched the PubMed database for studies published between January 1975 and February 2023. They found 202 articles, then narrowed those down to 20 that met their criteria. In the end, the researchers included 11 studies in their detailed statistical analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each study was a randomized controlled trial, meaning participants were randomly assigned to take vitamin D2 or not. The researchers compared vitamin D3 levels in the blood before and after supplementation to see how they changed. This approach helped reveal whether a consistent pattern appeared across studies—in this case, whether taking vitamin D2 affected vitamin D3 levels in the body.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who took &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11762480" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2 supplements&lt;/a&gt; saw a noticeable drop in vitamin D3 levels compared with those who didn’t. On average, serum levels of vitamin D3 fell by about 18 nanomoles per liter by the end of the study period and about 9 nanomoles per liter when researchers looked at overall change during the trials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because this pattern showed up across several randomized controlled studies, the results suggest a real cause-and-effect link—taking vitamin D2 appears to lower vitamin D3 levels in the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers say more work is needed to understand exactly how this happens, but the findings add to the growing evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-maximum-absorption-11743667" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 may be the better option&lt;/a&gt; for most people &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;when choosing a supplement&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you take a vitamin D supplement, this research shows that the type you choose really does matter. Both D2 and D3 can boost overall vitamin D levels, but D3 seems to do a better job of keeping those levels steady and supporting your health long term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also get some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D from food&lt;/a&gt;, though natural sources are limited. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel and sardines are among the best options, along with egg yolks, beef liver and mushrooms exposed to UV light. Many everyday foods, such as milk, plant-based milks, yogurt and breakfast cereals, are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified to help fill the gap&lt;/a&gt;—but it can still be hard to meet daily needs through diet alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re concerned about reaching your goal intake, considering talking to a health care professional about starting a supplement. They may even have a recommendation for you on which one to snag at the pharmacy or grocery store.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And for anyone who follows a vegan or plant-based diet, there’s good news: vegan vitamin D3 made from lichen—a natural, non-animal source—is available and works more like traditional D3.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research adds weight to what smaller studies have hinted for years: vitamin D3 appears to be the more effective form of vitamin D for maintaining healthy levels in the body. The consistent drop in D3 seen after D2 supplementation suggests the two forms don’t work the same way, and that they shouldn’t be treated as interchangeable. While D2 can still raise total vitamin D to some degree, this analysis shows it may also cause D3 levels to fall. Until researchers understand why this happens, it makes sense to consider D3 the more reliable option for most people. Talk to a health care professional if you’re considering starting a vitamin D supplement or wondering if you’re taking the right one for your needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that B vitamins may help lower the risk of disabling dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers connected riboflavin (vitamin B2) with a 49% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study only captured vitamin intake from food and drink, not supplements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You know that moment when you open the pantry and can’t remember what you came looking for? Most of us shrug off those little lapses, but they still spark the same quiet question: Is there anything I can do now to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help my brain age well&lt;/a&gt;? Diet is one of the few levers we actually control, and a new study suggests that some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;humble B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, the kind you’ll find in everyday foods, may matter more than we think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in Japan followed adults for more than 15 years and just reported in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that people who ate the most riboflavin (vitamin B2) had up to a 49% lower risk of developing disabling dementia than those who ate the least. Folate and vitamin B6 also tracked with lower risk, while vitamin B12 didn’t show a clear link. It’s an intriguing pattern that fits what we already know about B vitamins: they’re workhorses in energy metabolism and help regulate homocysteine, a compound tied to vascular and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No single nutrient is a magic shield, and this study can’t prove cause and effect. But it does add a real-world, long-term data point to the idea that what’s on your plate can support your brain over the decades. Here’s what the researchers did, what they found and how to turn those insights into everyday meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from the community-based Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS), which enrolled 4,171 Japanese adults ages 40 to 69. Diet was assessed by trained dietitians using a standardized 24-hour dietary recall. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were then followed for a median of 15.4 years. They tracked new cases of dementia serious enough to require daily help, using Japan’s national long-term care insurance records—a trusted source researchers rely on. They compared people who ate the least B vitamins to those who ate the most and calculated their chances of developing dementia, accounting for factors like age, sex, body size, smoking, drinking, medications, and diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Riboflavin stood out: compared with the group with the lowest intake, the highest-intake group had about a 49% lower risk of disabling dementia. People who got more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-vitamin-deficiency-study-8784014" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B6 and folate&lt;/a&gt; also tended to have a lower chance of dementia (by about 20%), while B12 didn’t stand out. The riboflavin and B6 connections were stronger among participants who had never had a stroke, hinting that these vitamins could be relevant for non-vascular forms of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one had certain limitations. Diet was captured from a single 24-hour recall, B-vitamin supplements weren’t recorded and the researchers couldn’t distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other dementia subtypes. There were also gaps in surveillance timing in some communities—though sensitivity checks suggested the main findings were robust. As an observational study, the results show association, not causation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While no single nutrient can prevent dementia, this study supports a food-first approach that regularly supplies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-b12-than-beef-11776277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B-vitamin–rich choices&lt;/a&gt;. Some of those foods may already be waiting for you in your fridge and pantry—here are just a few:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riboflavin (B2)&lt;/strong&gt; is found in dairy (milk, yogurt), eggs, lean meats and fish, mushrooms, almonds and spinach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt; can be found in poultry, salmon, potatoes, bananas, chickpeas and squash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folate&lt;/strong&gt; is a key nutrient in leafy greens (spinach, romaine), asparagus, avocado, citrus, beans and lentils and fortified grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there are plenty of practical ways to incorporate these foods and the beneficial nutrients they offer into your eating plan. For instance, you can build a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260740/rainbow-buddha-bowl-with-cashew-tahini-sauce/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grain bowl with lentils&lt;/a&gt;, sauteed greens and salmon and bring it along to work for lunch. Or try tossing chickpeas into a spinach salad, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275918/apple-cranberry-spinach-salad-with-goat-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Apple-Cranberry Spinach Salad with Goat Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At breakfast, choose &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fortified whole-grain cereal&lt;/a&gt; with milk and sliced banana, or opt for eggs with greens. For snacks, try yogurt with crushed almonds or hummus with veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the study didn’t assess supplements and more isn’t always better, check with your healthcare provider before starting a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-b-complex-vitamins-11779582" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B-complex supplement&lt;/a&gt;.

That pattern naturally delivers the B vitamins highlighted here along with fiber and other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-after-60-11799297" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;brain-supportive nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a large Japanese cohort followed for more than 15 years, higher intakes of riboflavin—and to a lesser extent vitamin B6 and folate—were linked with a lower risk of disabling dementia, while vitamin B12 showed no significant association.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published this year pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes and shows how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence"&gt;Study Traces Autism's Origin to The Rise of Human Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

The ability of these genes to impact cascades and networks of processes, such as gene regulation, could explain why the same variants can contribute to different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pleiotropy was traditionally viewed as a challenge because it complicates the classification of psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, if we can understand the genetic basis of pleiotropy, it might allow us to develop treatments targeting these shared genetic factors, which could then help treat multiple psychiatric disorders with a common therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a very useful strategy given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates 1 in 8 people (almost 1 billion in total) live with some form of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders"&gt;psychiatric condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.12.022"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in February 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, all Americans are tasked with consulting with their healthcare providers to decide if they should get a seasonal COVID-19 booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes follow recommendations made by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cdc-advisers-scale-back-recommendations-mmrv-vaccine-young-kids"&gt;&lt;u&gt;last month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and are meant to place "shared clinical decision making" at the forefront of vaccine administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision called 'misleading'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1975275749083943245"&gt;&lt;u&gt;On X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, said the announcement was misleading.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vaccinators may require proof of a discussion with a clinical before vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All vaccines come with shared deciding making between patients and clinicians, he said. But under the new CDC recommendation, "Vaccinators may require proof of a discussion with a clinical before vaccination. In many states that means getting a prescription with a diagnosis code before a vaccine will be administered.&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;This means that pharmacists, in some states, aren't given the authority to share in decision making."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis added, "All vaccination involves discussion. The acting director is showing his lack of experience in the clinical or policy space and is purposefully trying to say, 'finally clinicians have to talk to their patients.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HHS press release said the COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be covered by both private and public insurers.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chickenpox vaccine already given separately to 85%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for standalone varicella vaccination comes after ACIP was presented evidence by the CDC Immunization Safety Office showing that 12- to 23-month-old toddlers had an increased risk of febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after vaccination for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine compared to those given immunization for chickenpox separately.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the HHS, the combination vaccine doubles the risk of febrile seizures without conferring additional protection from varicella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined vaccine was licensed in 2005 to promote increased vaccine uptake, but currently only &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cdc-advisers-scale-back-recommendations-mmrv-vaccine-young-kids"&gt;&lt;u&gt;15% of US parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; choose it for&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;children ages 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I commend the doctors and public health experts of ACIP for educating Americans about important vaccine safety signals," O'Neill said. "I also thank President Trump for his leadership in making sure we protect children from unintended side effects during routine immunization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY state extends executive order for pharmacists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related developments, yesterday New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed an extension to an executive order allowing pharmacists in the state to administer COVID-19 vaccines for an additional 30 days without a prescription under a standing order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will sign as many extensions of this executive order as I need to," &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-extends-executive-order-ensuring-all-new-yorkers-can-receive-updated-2025-26"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hochul said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

POTS causes a rapid heartbeat when standing up after lying down and sometimes at rest and during exercise. Because standing up triggers dizziness, affected patients prefer to sit or lie down (orthostatic intolerance). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A third had chronic diseases before infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karolinska Institutet investigators prospectively evaluated the prevalence and clinical effects of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) in 467 nonhospitalized patients who took sick leave from work at least half of the time because of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. The team also compared demographic factors and clinical outcomes among those diagnosed as having POTS with those without the heart-rhythm disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A median of 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients underwent physical testing and completed health forms. Those who showed signs of POTS met with a cardiologist, who performed 48-hour electrocardiography, the 6-minute walk test, head-up tilt testing, and the active stand test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An increase in heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute after moving from the supine (lying face up) or upright position without orthostatic hypotension and a symptom duration of at least 3 months after ruling out other conditions was diagnostic of POTS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all participants, 84% were women, and 32% had chronic diseases before their COVID-19 infection, with asthma (16%) and obesity (15%) being most common.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Less physical activity, capacity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 31% of all long-COVID patients were diagnosed as having POTS, 27% didn't meet the criteria for the condition, and 42% had no clinical signs of POTS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with a POTS diagnosis were nearly all women (91%) and younger than those who didn't meet the criteria or had no signs (average age, 40.0 vs 44.0 vs 47.0 years, respectively). Most middle-aged POTS patients were healthy and active before they developed long COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

King and her family released a statement on their daughter’s death Monday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Candis lived a beautiful life and had just celebrated her 15th birthday,” the family’s statement reads. “She was a talented singer and dancer, a proud member of her high school’s Color Guard, and she had a special love for Transformers. Above all, she was deeply loved and cherished by her family.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The family asked for privacy as they grieve. King said she would momentarily step away from her reelection campaign in Virginia’s 23th House District, which covers parts of Prince William and Stafford County.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colgan High School Principal Tim Healy shared the news in a message to the school community over the weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are working with Candis’ family to provide any needed support,” Healey said. “There will be a Critical Incident Team at the school [Monday]. Additionally, there are resources here at school available for both staff members and students who need support in coping with their sadness. Please pay attention to your student’s emotional needs during the next few weeks, especially if they knew Candis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;State Del. Don Scott, speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, also released a statement on Candis’ death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My heart is full of sorrow today. Late Saturday night, I received the devastating news that Delegate Candi Mundon King’s beloved daughter, Candis, lost her courageous battle with sickle cell disease,” Scott said. “No parent should ever experience the loss of a child at the hands of a cruel and unforgiving illness.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott continued, “Delegate King is one of the bravest, kindest, and most remarkable people I know. From the moment you meet her, you feel her strength and her light. She is a fighter for her community, a bold voice for the disabled, and above all— a loving mother who would move mountains for her children.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But science says it is more than that. Anxiety isn’t just a feeling that’s confined to the mind but rather a condition which can affect the whole body. Unless managed properly, anxiety can even impact long term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, anxiety disorders are the world's most common mental disorders, which in 2021, affected 359 million people globally. It is a matter of concern that only 1 in 4 people, suffering from anxiety disorder, receive any treatment. This is partly because of lack of mental health services and partly because many people don’t even know they are suffering from this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Workplace Anxiety Linked to Rising Health Issues Among Employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The hidden physical effects of anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with anxiety may experience excessive worry or fear, restlessness or difficulty in concentrating. These symptoms may just seem ‘mental’ or ‘emotional’, but they signal that the body’s stress system is working overtime. Chronic anxiety triggers the body's stress response system by keeping cortisol and adrenaline elevated and over time this can affect multiple organ systems contributing to long term health-risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cardiovascular health issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorder is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5149447/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;linked to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; increased heart rate, high BP and heightened inflammation.

The county provided the remaining $800,000 needed for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;News 5 flies a drone over Molly Stark before its demolition — watch it here:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dluiZVhEzh8?si=s0TpueU4iF0_sW2W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Warning: Offensive language may be found in this drone footage—vandals drew quite a lot on the walls) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 95-year-old Jane Bracht, the demolition marks the end of a chapter that changed her life. In 1964, she was a young mother diagnosed with tuberculosis and quarantined at the sanatorium for six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't imagine to be swiped from your house and your child 4.5 years old," Bracht said. "I didn't even get to say goodbye to her and tell her what was happening. It was really a terrible experience for six months." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience had a lasting impact on this retired nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time I go into the hospital, I have a hard time. Everything comes back to me," Bracht said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in 1929, the Molly Stark Sanatorium specialized in treating tuberculosis patients. Thousands received care there until it closed in 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a property auction at the site following its closure, Bracht purchased nightstands that had been used at Molly Stark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was part of my life for six months and I wanted something from there," Bracht said. "I'd like to get a brick [too]." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stark Parks took over the 40-acre property in 2009, but keeping trespassers out has been an ongoing challenge. The organization installed a $30,000 fence in 2015, but people continued to break in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's been a huge priority," Dan Moeglin, executive director at Stark Parks, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's in the hundreds of thousands of dollars that we've spent in terms of staff time from keeping people from getting themselves hurt," Sarah Buell, Capital Projects and Planning Manager at Stark Parks, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers previously told Stark Parks that restoring or renovating the deteriorating building wouldn't make financial sense. The roof has caved in, wildlife has moved in, and nature has taken its toll on the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once demolition is complete, Stark Parks plans to convert the grounds into park space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to green this space up, reuse the entire grounds as some kind of park activity," Moeglin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[An earlier version of this story said demolition was scheduled to start on Monday. Stark Parks notified News 5 Monday morning and said the contractor is still bringing in equipment today and it will be a day or two before they start the work.]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reporter's Note: News 5 conducted the majority of these interviews in February 2025. In an effort to curb trespassing, News 5 chose not to air this story until a formal demolition date was set.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Form"&gt;&lt;p class="Form-title"&gt;We Follow Through&lt;/p&gt;

The new evidence points to vitamin B biology shaped by gut bacteria, and it hints at a safe, low cost way to help some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parkinson-s-disease-and-b-vitamins"&gt;Parkinson’s disease and B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study analyzed stool samples from 94 people with Parkinson’s and 73 controls in Japan, then combined results across six countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used metagenomic shotgun sequencing (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4059276/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MSS&lt;/a&gt;), a method that reads all genetic material in a sample without targeting a single organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw a consistent pattern. Genes in gut bacteria that make riboflavin and biotin were reduced in people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in genes was tied to important chemicals in the gut. People with Parkinson’s had lower levels of short chain fatty acids (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-024-01014-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SCFAs&lt;/a&gt;) and polyamines, two groups of molecules that support a sturdy intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nishiwaki-Hiroshi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hiroshi Nishiwaki&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.med.nagoya-u.ac.jp/medical_E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt; Graduate School of Medicine. His group focused on function, not just which bugs were present, because different bacteria can perform the same jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-s-chemistry-ties-to-the-brain"&gt;Gut’s chemistry ties to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut wall is coated with mucus that shields the tissue beneath. SCFAs and polyamines help build and maintain that layer, which keeps harmful stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found increased intestinal permeability in people with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-holes-in-brain-cells-may-unlock-the-mystery-of-parkinsons/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, which means the barrier becomes leaky. When that happens, the nervous system that runs through your intestines faces more stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3281589/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;α-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; enters the story. This protein can clump in nerve cells, and those clumps are a hallmark of Parkinson’s in movement hubs of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-b-vitamins-and-parkinson-s"&gt;B vitamins and Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also called vitamin B2, and biotin, vitamin B7 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micronutrient-deficiency-rates-are-soaring-worldwide/"&gt;act as helpers&lt;/a&gt; for enzymes that shape SCFAs and polyamines in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supplementation therapy targeting riboflavin and biotin holds promise as a potential therapeutic avenue for alleviating PD symptoms and slowing disease progression,” said Nishiwaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a small but relevant clinical clue from the past. A 2003 open label &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/BM4WLJBtjxF8Cx3wFsjFhKb/?format=pdf&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; reported that high dose riboflavin, together with eliminating red meat, improved some motor functions in people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/proteasomes-in-brain-cells-play-key-role-in-sensing-pain/"&gt;Biotin&lt;/a&gt; has its own resume in inflammation biology. Although its direct testing in Parkinson’s is limited, biotin has shown benefits in other neurological conditions where inflammation is a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-not-mean"&gt;What this does not mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not prove that taking B vitamins will help every person with Parkinson’s. The biology varies from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does not say that specific bacteria are always to blame. Different countries showed different microbes driving the same reduction in vitamin making pathways, which implies the function matters more than the exact species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage, timing, and safety still need careful study. Vitamins are not risk free at very high doses, and interactions with medications must be considered by clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the gut barrier thins, more toxins can reach nerve endings in the intestinal wall. That exposure may encourage α-synuclein clumping and feed inflammation over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1002839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked certain pesticides, including paraquat and rotenone, with higher Parkinson’s risk. The gut route offers a plausible path for those exposures to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-patients-and-doctors"&gt;Next steps for patients and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One practical step is measuring what is actually low. Fecal metabolite testing can check SCFAs and polyamines, and blood work can assess vitamin status when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted supplementation might make sense for people who show clear deficits. That approach tries to restore the chemistry that keeps the mucus layer strong and the gut less leaky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could perform gut microbiota analysis on patients or conduct fecal metabolite analysis,” said Nishiwaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parkinson-s-gut-brain-connection"&gt;Parkinson’s gut-brain connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vagus nerve connects the intestines and the brain. Signals and molecules flow both ways, and that traffic can influence movement circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, gut symptoms like constipation often show up years before &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;tremors or stiffness&lt;/a&gt;. That timing suggests the disease process may involve the gut early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbial genes that make riboflavin and biotin are one target. If those are down, the gut may produce fewer of these vitamins even when diet looks fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various SCFAs can be measured in stool samples. Lower levels hint at a community that is not fermenting fiber effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitamin-b-parkinson-s-future-study"&gt;Vitamin B, Parkinson’s, future study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intestinal mucus layer is not just a coating. It is living infrastructure that keeps microbes at the right distance from the lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCFAs and polyamines help renew that barrier and support the cells that make mucus. When their levels drop, permeability can rise and the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; can overreact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomized trials will need to test riboflavin and biotin in well defined groups. The best candidates may be those who show low vitamin linked pathways and low SCFAs or polyamines at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also track how supplementation shifts the microbiome, SCFAs, polyamines, and motor and non motor symptoms. If the chemistry and the clinical picture improve together, confidence will grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-024-00724-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 19:39:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPcFlKV2lzQU8yamR1OWM2V3hab1B2VW9odHBZYzFpV0xwcGFCamxsYllyZG1mcXRGTnMyUWVsQmhnLU55ZUt5MVBGbTc2QU5TTFZyQ25JbHFNbjk2SkxtQUkwNDZNSWxOOWM5c3FzM1llOXZiUlAtZVlaZmR5bkEya2NubzBNV1JqcE03ODl6T3ZLVjVQNDZRUlp3Rzl5UERxNS1qWWlMVldIQ0ItY2JwZ2RqY0U</guid></item><item><title>揭示糖尿病失明的隐藏早期迹象-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/diabetes-vision-neurotech-29779/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have developed a powerful new imaging method that reveals how immune cells in the eye behave long before visible damage occurs in diabetic retinopathy. Using a combination of a head-fixation device, contact lenses, and a custom objective lens, researchers were able to capture live, high-resolution images of microglia activity in diabetic mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that microglia—the retina’s immune sentinels—became hyperactive early in disease progression, suggesting inflammation precedes blood vessel damage. The findings also show that the diabetes drug liraglutide normalizes this overactivity, pointing to new treatment pathways and diagnostic tools for preventing blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia become hyperactive before visible vascular damage in diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Imaging Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; A custom optical system allows real-time visualization of living retinal cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Liraglutide restores normal microglial activity, even without affecting blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kobe University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetic retinopathy, a form of diabetic eye disease, is one of the leading causes of blindness around the globe. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s understood that vision is lost due to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, but recent research has identified that abnormalities in neurons and immune cells begin prior to vascular damage,” says Kobe University neurophysiologist TACHIBANA Yoshihisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With insights like these becoming possible, the ability to observe the behavior of cells in the living organism directly is of great advantage for developing new treatments. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continues: “In particular, microglia, immune cells that reside in the retina and constantly monitor their environment, initiate inflammation when abnormalities occur. But because it is difficult to observe their behavior in living organisms, much of their involvement has remained in the dark.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional microscopy setups either require advanced technical expertise to correct the distorted images or don’t achieve high-resolution live images with readily available technology. That’s why Tachibana and his team developed a new technology that combines a head-fixation device, custom-made contact lenses and a special but commercially available objective lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “This approach allows us clear, long-term observation of the living retina, down to the minute movements of microglia,” the Kobe University researcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, Tachibana and his team now report that their newly developed method allowed them to identify that microglia start to move more actively in diabetic mice, indicating increased monitoring activity, long before tissue damage is noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This phenomenon has been overlooked in conventional observation in non-living specimens and is an important finding that provides a new perspective for understanding the pathology of diabetic retinopathy,” explains Tachibana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team also observed the effect of the diabetes drug liraglutide on microglia. They found that in diabetic mice, the heightened activity of microglia was returned to normal, but also that the activity of these cells got reduced in healthy mice, too. In addition, the drug did not alter sugar levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tachibana says, “This suggests that liraglutide acts on microglia through a mechanism that directly modulates their behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With insights like these becoming possible, the ability to observe the behavior of cells in the living organism directly is of great advantage for developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We expect this technology to be useful for other retinal diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, too,” says Tachibana. But the Kobe University researcher also has his sight on another goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says: “Blindness by diabetic eye disease is a serious global challenge. We hope that our technology may be put to practical use in clinical settings as a non-invasive diagnostic method, making the eye a window to spotting systemic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the Bayer Japan Retina Award, Novartis Japan Co.

People with the condition often have more trouble shifting their focus away from negative emotions and tend to get stuck in cycles of repetitive, negative thoughts, a process known as rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also frequently report feeling mentally rigid. Instead of the emotional state passing, the mind gets locked onto it, which fuels the intense reaction and the cycle of rumination that often follows. Importantly, these traits are specific to misophonia itself and aren't just side effects of common issues like anxiety or &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-d8ce4530-a2c1-11f0-a804-7da67ad40ff1"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In discovering that the condition may be hardwired into someone's brain, it could open a door for potential treatments, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11988243/Treating-depression-using-CBT-therapy-help-cut-risk-heart-attacks-strokes.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT), mindfulness-based treatments, and metacognitive training, which focuses on changing someone’s thoughts rather than their thinking habits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers argued in their latest study that these methods could help people shift away from rigid thought patterns and develop greater emotional adaptability in response to sensory triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Hearing someone chew a crunchy snack can be highly distressing for people with misophonia. The disorder can lead to feelings of visceral disgust or anger (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Misophonia often causes feelings of disgust, but the response can also be anger or anxiety, and research shows that people with the condition often struggle with key mental management skills, known as executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A core issue among sufferers is cognitive inflexibility, meaning they find it extremely difficult to stop focusing on a trigger sound and shift their attention away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to a cycle of hyper-focusing on the sound, anxious anticipation of it, and trouble engaging with anything else. In short, their brain gets ‘stuck’ on the trigger, which aligns with their own reports of being mentally inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that people with misophonia have a consistent kind of mental rigidity, which showed up in two ways: they struggled with quick emotional shifts during a test, and they described themselves as generally inflexible in their daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pattern of thinking is also a common feature in conditions often linked to misophonia, like OCD, autism and PTSD, which can be helped with CBT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study author Dr Mercede Erfanian &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psypost.org/only-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-misophonia-may-reflect-deeper-psychological-realities/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘For a long time, I’ve thought that misophonia might be more than just a sound-sensitivity condition. Instead of sound sensitivity being the root cause, it might actually be just one symptom of a broader, more complex disorder.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study involved 140 adults, with an average age of 30, and 128 were recruited via an online platform. A smaller group of 12 was recruited from misophonia support communities to ensure a strong representation of those with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used a recognized benchmark to identify participants with significant misophonia, specifically a score of 87 or higher out of 250 on the 25-item S-Five questionnaire, which measures the severity of misophonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;This violin graph shows that people (represented by dots) with significant misophonia (group b) are worse at the emotional switching task than people without it (group a). A wider section means more people had that score. The group A shape is wider higher up, meaning more people in this group had high accuracy scores. Group B's shape is more narrow at the top and wider lower down, meaning more people in this group had lower accuracy scores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to this measure, 35 individuals in the study, 25 percent of the total, fell into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate the core research questions, participants first completed a specialized computer task known as the Memory and Affective Flexibility Task (MAFT) designed to measure a specific skill called affective flexibility, or the ability to rapidly shift one's thinking and attention in response to emotionally charged pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, to establish a baseline, people were shown a series of images and simply had to decide if the picture they were seeing now was the same as one they saw a few pictures back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, without warning, a new picture would appear, and instead of asking about memory, the task would ask if the image was positive, such as a happy baby, or negative, like a mutilated body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the picture was from the ‘positive’ category and the participant pressed the corresponding ‘positive’ key, that was accurate. If the picture was from the ‘negative’ category and the participant pressed the ‘negative’ key, that was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High accuracy on the switch trials shows a flexible brain that could cleanly shift gears under emotional pressure. Low accuracy indicates a ‘stuck’ brain, meaning it was overwhelmed by the picture's content or unable to disengage from the previous task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This directly parallels misophonia. Poor performance suggests the struggle is not just with trigger sounds, but with a broader inability to disengage from any harmful emotional distraction, like crunching food. The brain gets stuck on a trigger sound in life just as it got stuck on a disturbing picture in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average person in the misophonia group performed worse than about 75 percent of the people in the non-misophonia group on the MAFT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study found people with misophonia share a core trait of mental rigidity. This was evident both in their difficulty with emotional shifts during a lab test and in their self-reported inflexibility in daily life, a cognitive style also common in conditions like OCD and autism (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As scores for mental rigidity went up, misophonia severity also went up, even after accounting for other factors like anxiety, and still explained a significant and unique portion of a person's misophonia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the computer task, all of the study participants completed a comprehensive array of established psychological questionnaires used to quantitatively measure several key traits, including the severity of their misophonia symptoms, their self-reported level of cognitive inflexibility in daily life and their tendency to engage in different forms of rumination, including brooding and anger-related repetitive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person's mental rigidity led to misophonia distress largely because it made them prone to getting stuck in cycles of negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers discovered that repetitive negative thoughts were a major reason why mental rigidity leads to misophonia. This thinking style was responsible for about 40 percent of the link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.70025"&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Erfanian said: ‘Misophonia is a real, disabling disorder, not simply an overreaction to annoying sounds. It is not caused by a problem with the ears or hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Proper diagnosis requires expertise, since it is complex and multifaceted. Importantly, sound sensitivity may be just one outward symptom, pointing to a broader set of psychological differences, similar to autism or obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 19:10:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>让我们看到不存在的东西的神经元- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/the-neurons-that-let-us-see-what-isnt-there/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work had hinted at such cells, but Shin and colleagues show systematically that they’re not rare oddballs—they’re a well-defined, functionally important subpopulation. “What we didn’t know is that these neurons drive local pattern completion within primary visual cortex,” says Shin. “We showed that those cells are causally involved in this pattern completion process that we speculate is likely involved in the perceptual process of illusory contours,” adds Adesnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behavioral tests still to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the mice “saw” the illusory contours when the neurons were artificially activated. “We didn’t actually measure behavior in this study,” says Adesnik. “It was about the neural representation.” All we can say at this point is that the IC-encoders could induce neural activity patterns that matched what imaging shows during normal perception of illusory contours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the mice weren’t seeing them,” admits Shin, “because the technique has involved a relatively small number of neurons, for technical limitations. But in the future, one could expand the number of neurons and also introduce behavioral tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the next frontier, Adesnik says: “What we would do is photo-stimulate these neurons and see if we can generate an animal’s behavioral response even without any stimulus on the screen.” Right now, optogenetics can only drive a small number of neurons, and IC-encoders are relatively rare and scattered. “For now, we have only stimulated a small number of these detectors, mainly because of technical limitations. IC-encoders are a rare population, probably distributed through the layers [of the visual system], but we could imagine an experiment where we recruit three, four, five, maybe even 10 times as many neurons,” he says. “In this case, I think we might be able to start getting behavioral responses. We’d definitely very much like to do this test.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County’s top health official on Monday issued a mandatory masking requirement for certain health care facilities, a move aimed at curbing the spread of influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses during the fall and winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masking order, which takes effect Nov. 1, is less restrictive than a similar one issued last year and targets facilities that care for seniors and frail or ailing patients, said Dr. Karen Smith, Sonoma County’s interim health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affected facilities include skilled nursing homes; certain areas of long-term care facilities where nursing care is provided; acute and non-acute rehabilitation facilities; infusion centers; and dialysis centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order applies to all workers and visitors who enter “patient care areas,” regardless of their vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said public health data shows that these facilities are where transmission of respiratory viruses is most prevalent, and where most outbreaks are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are the places where people who are most vulnerable really do need to be protected, either because of their age or they’re immunocompromised, or a combination of those things,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that often these medical facilities “already struggle to stay fully staffed and really can’t afford to have staff going out sick.” Masking, she said, protects both patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sonoma County health officials issued a masking order that included general acute-care hospitals, inpatient psychiatric hospitals, as well as outpatient medical clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said she and other Bay Area health officers consulted with clinical directors across the local health care landscape and determined that such facilities were not now hot spots for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We decided to give them a strong recommendation to mask, but it’s up to them to decide to what degree and in what spaces,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said this year’s health order also “narrowed the spaces” where masking is required. Rather than require masking “everywhere patients go,” this year’s mask mandate focuses on areas of the specified facilities where patients and providers interact rather than casually walk past each other.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s less broad and, I think, more practical, as well as being supported by the data that we do have,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County health officials said similar health orders requiring medical workers to mask during the winter flu season have been issued since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said the “summer surge” of COVID-19 cases, which started a little later than usual, is finally receding. Transmission across the state has been high but is now decreasing to moderate levels, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the order, which remains in effect through March 31, will be re-issued annually, unless rescinded and dates may be adjusted based on viral surveillance data, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still do expect that there will be a winter wave,” she said. “But this is good, because it gives people a chance to get their COVID vaccines before it starts circulating again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, influenza transmission is still low but “it’s bound to rise again.”&lt;/p&gt;

                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called "shared decision-making,"or "individual-based decision-making" according to the language in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/cdc-immunization-schedule-adopts-individual-based-decision.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final recommendations were delayed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The step came after an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559439/cdc-covid-vaccine-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unusual, unexplained two-week lag&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559439/cdc-covid-vaccine-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allows the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Informed consent is back," O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. "CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients," said &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines," wrote Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=17154" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tina Tan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. "This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use," Reiss added in an email. "If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Barriers to vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became harder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more "risk-based" COVID vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Over the past month, the change caused &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anger, frustration and confusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to recommend the shots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Confusion still reigns &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The requirement for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shared clinical decision-making&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/policy-recs-mmrv-briefing-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data shared&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. "This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option," says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, "This is effectively removing a choice from parents."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. "There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined," she says, "It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also been suggested it may be because patients who suffer the injury already have undiagnosed dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia and MCI &lt;span&gt;are known to raise the risk of suffering from a fall or TBI, which may then speed the advancement of the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 14million Americans, or one in four, aged 65 years and older, suffer from a fall every year, with up to 60 percent of these resulting in a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, suffered by about 7million people a year, with cases estimated to reach 13million by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Falls are the most common cause of TBI for older adults, but they can also be caused by car accidents or head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In milder cases, sufferers may lose consciousness for a few seconds to a minute, have temporary memory or concentration issues, or be dizzy and lose balance again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In moderate to severe injuries, patients may lose consciousness for several minutes to hours, and then experience persistent headaches, confusion, agitation and slurred speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also cause personality changes and, at times, lasting disabilities such as memory loss, difficulty with concentration and slower processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear how often TBIs are mild versus moderate or severe, although a World Health Organization review previously found that about 70 to 90 percent of all TBIs were mild in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percentage of participants who developed dementia (Y axis, or vertical axis) by time in years (X axis, or horizontal axis). It shows people who suffered from a traumatic brain injury were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is just the latest study to find a link between a TBI and a higher risk of dementia, after a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13907587/common-injury-increase-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; showed adults over 65 years old who suffered from a fall were 20 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia a year later than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/33/E1067#sec-16"&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed data from health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They looked at adults aged 65 years and older who had suffered a traumatic brain injury between April 2004 and March 2020 from any cause and compared them to similar people who had not suffered the head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were followed until they were diagnosed with dementia, the study's end in March 2021 or had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the increased risk of dementia, researchers also found that, overall, about one in three people aged 85 years or older who suffered from a TBI would develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the groups analyzed, those who were female and 75 years or older were found to be most at risk of the dementia diagnosis after a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be because women live longer than men, and are more likely to suffer from muscle weakness, osteoporosis or dementia, raising the risk of a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a CDC map showing the states that report the most and least falls among older adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also showed that patients who were older, lived in small communities, and in areas with low income and ethnic diversity were the most likely to be admitted to a nursing home after suffering from a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the risk of being diagnosed with dementia after suffering from a TBI dropped slightly after five years, although this may be because the brain has managed to repair the initial damage from the injury, possibly slightly lowering the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Huang added: 'Our findings suggest that, to better align limited health resources with population needs, specialized programs such as community-based dementia prevention programs, and support services should be prioritized for female older adults (over 75 years old) living in smaller communities and low-income and low-diversity areas.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the authors added: 'Although TBI has been studied as a risk factor for dementia in adulthood, our findings emphasize its significant association with an increased rate of incident dementia, even when it is sustained in late life, and how this risk changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is critical information [that] can assist clinicians in guiding older patients and their families to better understand long-term risks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:35:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPY1JBRk1kcVRIa0xQQTJ3dktXcEFzaU1CSUlGYUw0aTBWa3ZWY2RKYlhmRzgzZnU1UFVWeUlLc1BJRS1YZU93ZDJ3bEs0WlpYMkpuX1NvNTUzM09KdjBjLXFVRjlySWt5OE5GeDVYSHhzTEwwZGFVYkpNdGJOTmRNVDBVUGtOT1lDaXFrODRXSEh3VkFlUWI3LUZn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5pdm5xMUtlS1BJb2FmV0gxdGh6UmFJMHBJVEZ3YVdxQzQ0UDlxb2s1dWZISXpmUDM2QTJFSHNFckFoNFkyVDBaQWFNNUpLZkJPSkxCSV9wbE1SZEtmb1gxNWFrMVJKTU45SFlpRy11ZzJTWV9GSnU2anlNdzRsbEt0d1MtX1J5WVUxcEpqWmFhcUs2dU5yQS16ZXZUcm1MNA</guid></item><item><title>我不知道自己有致命的胃病，被弄得筋疲力尽-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15156831/stomach-pain-bloating-twisting-bowel-cecal-volvulus.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez always had another call to take, a meeting to attend or trip booked in her calendar.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strategist from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-6f6d7790-9fd9-11f0-88b7-b7a95fa3539d"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; was attending a weekend retreat in the fall of 2022 when she noticed an unshakeable sluggishness and that she wasn't quite feeling like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While at the retreat, she met with a holistic nutritionist who suggested a few diet swaps like cutting out dairy and lowering fat intake. She also urged Gonzalez to see her doctor for a series of blood tests to look for infections or chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for months, the order for blood work sat on Gonzalez's desk as she continuously promised herself she'd make the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-one, now 48, told Daily Mail: 'For whatever reason, it didn't make my top priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As 2023 wore on, Gonzalez became more and more rundown, moving through her days 'like molasses.' Her stomach also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15004199/blamed-bloating-bad-diet-diagnosed-cancer-young-people.html"&gt;became increasingly bloated&lt;/a&gt;, and she would go upwards of a week without having a bowel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The year drew to a close and Gonzalez promised herself she would start a health challenge on January 10, 2024, with her family and friends to improve her gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when January 10 came, she was on a business trip across the country in Seattle, waking up in the middle night with excruciating abdominal pain: 'It was like I was in full-blown labor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez (pictured here), a 48-year-old strategist in New Jersey, ignored symptoms of an intestinal blockage for about a year before being rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital, with her husband and eight-year-old daughter nearly 3,000 miles away, and into emergency surgery, where doctors found her intestines had twisted 360 degrees into a knot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after the symptoms started, she was diagnosed with cecal volvulus, a rare type of obstruction that occurs when the cecum, a pouch between the small bowel and colon, detaches from the abdominal wall and twists itself, forming a blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can be difficult to diagnosis since its symptoms, including fatigue, trouble passing gas and bloating, mimic more benign, common conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gonzalez said: 'The sluggishness was the biggest thing. I'm a super energetic person. My calm is most people's normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I just wasn't myself. It was starting to take so much for me to feel that energetic self.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can go undetected for months or years until &lt;/span&gt;blood flow to the colon gradually gets cut off, causing tissues to die and tears to form in the bowel wall. If the condition progresses, the estimated mortality rate is about 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cecal volvulus only affects about three to seven per 1million people each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the fatigue and bloating, Gonzalez also noticed her Raynaud's disease, which causes extremities to become white or blue as a response to cold or stress, was flaring up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've had Raynaud's my whole life, but in that one year, I've never had to layer up so much. I could barely go outside in the winter because I was turning blue all the time, like my hands, my feet, my lips. It was painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel obstructions can cause widespread inflammatory reactions, which could trigger Raynaud's symptoms. The obstruction may have also constricted blood vessels elsewhere in Gonzalez's body, causing a flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Gonzalez got to the hospital, doctors told her if they waited any longer to operate, the obstruction would have burst and led to septic shock, the most severe stage of sepsis, the body's overreaction to an infection that causes the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez, pictured here on a New York City ad for Nasdaq, told the Daily Mail that seeing a doctor for her symptoms was not a priority with her busy job and lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were able to remove the blockage, but they also had to take a portion out of her colon and reconnect the remaining portion to the rest of her digestive system for it to function properly. Suddenly, always active Gonzalez had to work her way back up to walking across the room and eating most foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'My body basically had to learn how to rework.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are unsure what exactly may have caused Gonzalez's cecal volvulus, but they suspect for her it was simply a case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think it's a one-off, thankfully,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, obstructions like cecal volvulus have been tied to low cabin pressure in airplanes. As the plane goes up in the air, the lower pressure inside the cabin can cause gas to get trapped in the GI tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ispub.com/IJFP/2/2/4144"&gt;Internet Journal of Family Practice&lt;/a&gt; estimate air travel may cause gas to expand up to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Gonzalez's doctors did not say travel may have caused her obstruction, she was flying frequently at the time, which may have raised her risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections, pelvic tumors, violent fits of coughing and pregnancy have also been shown to increase the risk. Gonzalez had none of the former three risk factors but does have one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was hospitalized for a week after surgery and stayed in Seattle for another two weeks, as doctors wanted to lower her risk of developing blood clots on the plane, which can occur when sitting still for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for cecal volvulus, a rare type of intestinal blockage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital with her daughter. She spent a week in the hospital and about three months recovering from the operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once home three weeks after surgery, Gonzalez's diet consisted of 'the blandest things you could eat,' including white bread and pasta, rice and potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dairy, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale, fried foods and even applesauce are more difficult to digest due to high fiber and fat content, and Gonzalez needed low-fiber, low-fat foods to avoid straining her digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even now, she avoids cruciferous vegetables due to fiber and buttery foods high in fat. 'I miss a salad, but I can't do it,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was really trial and error for a few months of what my body could break down, or it would set me totally back if I ate the wrong thing. I would be in terrible pain, cramping up and just kind of keeled over on the sofa until it would pass,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dropped to below 100lbs since she could only eat small amounts of food at a time and is still working to regain the weight she lost. Additionally, she had to relearn how to walk due to the intense pain and the incision in her abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez will now have to undergo yearly stool tests to look for excess fat in her gut, a sign that the body isn't properly absorbing nutrients, and enzymes that may signal inflammation in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured after being cleared to fly again after surgery to repair her cecal volvulus.

It seems very obvious, but the fact of the matter is, most of us hear it because our body will tell us, and we don't listen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Well-being cannot be a side project.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, published by Wiley, is now available on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Target and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNYTRWUFJhVGVBdXZTejhONTdYeVY4QnhZbUMzdEpybXUtQ08zS0FoczZnU0RLN19SYzc3bUExREhXMWZlandnSjNFU1pQamVOeXNxZFRabFRjT0N1UUZKUDNJdFJTbENMajhtM0RYT0RJQWlrR3dzVXA2ZjdTcVRGN1NYQVZtVi1sNG5hUFR3aFNjaWRTYUNvVmtpbHNNczJla2lyZ1ZoZUZkQ0ZN</guid></item><item><title>我身体虚弱，腹胀，但不知道自己正在秘密与致命的胃病作斗争...不要忽视我的警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15156831/stomach-pain-bloating-twisting-bowel-cecal-volvulus.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez always had another call to take, a meeting to attend or trip booked in her calendar.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strategist from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-6f6d7790-9fd9-11f0-88b7-b7a95fa3539d"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; was attending a weekend retreat in the fall of 2022 when she noticed an unshakeable sluggishness and that she wasn't quite feeling like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While at the retreat, she met with a holistic nutritionist who suggested a few diet swaps like cutting out dairy and lowering fat intake. She also urged Gonzalez to see her doctor for a series of blood tests to look for infections or chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for months, the order for blood work sat on Gonzalez's desk as she continuously promised herself she'd make the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-one, now 48, told Daily Mail: 'For whatever reason, it didn't make my top priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As 2023 wore on, Gonzalez became more and more rundown, moving through her days 'like molasses.' Her stomach also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15004199/blamed-bloating-bad-diet-diagnosed-cancer-young-people.html"&gt;became increasingly bloated&lt;/a&gt;, and she would go upwards of a week without having a bowel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The year drew to a close and Gonzalez promised herself she would start a health challenge on January 10, 2024, with her family and friends to improve her gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when January 10 came, she was on a business trip across the country in Seattle, waking up in the middle night with excruciating abdominal pain: 'It was like I was in full-blown labor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez (pictured here), a 48-year-old strategist in New Jersey, ignored symptoms of an intestinal blockage for about a year before being rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital, with her husband and eight-year-old daughter nearly 3,000 miles away, and into emergency surgery, where doctors found her intestines had twisted 360 degrees into a knot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after the symptoms started, she was diagnosed with cecal volvulus, a rare type of obstruction that occurs when the cecum, a pouch between the small bowel and colon, detaches from the abdominal wall and twists itself, forming a blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can be difficult to diagnosis since its symptoms, including fatigue, trouble passing gas and bloating, mimic more benign, common conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gonzalez said: 'The sluggishness was the biggest thing. I'm a super energetic person. My calm is most people's normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I just wasn't myself. It was starting to take so much for me to feel that energetic self.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can go undetected for months or years until &lt;/span&gt;blood flow to the colon gradually gets cut off, causing tissues to die and tears to form in the bowel wall. If the condition progresses, the estimated mortality rate is about 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cecal volvulus only affects about three to seven per 1million people each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the fatigue and bloating, Gonzalez also noticed her Raynaud's disease, which causes extremities to become white or blue as a response to cold or stress, was flaring up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've had Raynaud's my whole life, but in that one year, I've never had to layer up so much. I could barely go outside in the winter because I was turning blue all the time, like my hands, my feet, my lips. It was painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel obstructions can cause widespread inflammatory reactions, which could trigger Raynaud's symptoms. The obstruction may have also constricted blood vessels elsewhere in Gonzalez's body, causing a flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Gonzalez got to the hospital, doctors told her if they waited any longer to operate, the obstruction would have burst and led to septic shock, the most severe stage of sepsis, the body's overreaction to an infection that causes the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez, pictured here on a New York City ad for Nasdaq, told the Daily Mail that seeing a doctor for her symptoms was not a priority with her busy job and lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were able to remove the blockage, but they also had to take a portion out of her colon and reconnect the remaining portion to the rest of her digestive system for it to function properly. Suddenly, always active Gonzalez had to work her way back up to walking across the room and eating most foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'My body basically had to learn how to rework.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are unsure what exactly may have caused Gonzalez's cecal volvulus, but they suspect for her it was simply a case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think it's a one-off, thankfully,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, obstructions like cecal volvulus have been tied to low cabin pressure in airplanes. As the plane goes up in the air, the lower pressure inside the cabin can cause gas to get trapped in the GI tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ispub.com/IJFP/2/2/4144"&gt;Internet Journal of Family Practice&lt;/a&gt; estimate air travel may cause gas to expand up to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Gonzalez's doctors did not say travel may have caused her obstruction, she was flying frequently at the time, which may have raised her risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections, pelvic tumors, violent fits of coughing and pregnancy have also been shown to increase the risk. Gonzalez had none of the former three risk factors but does have one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was hospitalized for a week after surgery and stayed in Seattle for another two weeks, as doctors wanted to lower her risk of developing blood clots on the plane, which can occur when sitting still for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for cecal volvulus, a rare type of intestinal blockage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital with her daughter. She spent a week in the hospital and about three months recovering from the operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once home three weeks after surgery, Gonzalez's diet consisted of 'the blandest things you could eat,' including white bread and pasta, rice and potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dairy, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale, fried foods and even applesauce are more difficult to digest due to high fiber and fat content, and Gonzalez needed low-fiber, low-fat foods to avoid straining her digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even now, she avoids cruciferous vegetables due to fiber and buttery foods high in fat. 'I miss a salad, but I can't do it,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was really trial and error for a few months of what my body could break down, or it would set me totally back if I ate the wrong thing. I would be in terrible pain, cramping up and just kind of keeled over on the sofa until it would pass,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dropped to below 100lbs since she could only eat small amounts of food at a time and is still working to regain the weight she lost. Additionally, she had to relearn how to walk due to the intense pain and the incision in her abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez will now have to undergo yearly stool tests to look for excess fat in her gut, a sign that the body isn't properly absorbing nutrients, and enzymes that may signal inflammation in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured after being cleared to fly again after surgery to repair her cecal volvulus. She has since written a book about her experience and those of other women who suffered similar health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since recovering from cecal volvulus, Gonzalez has taken her experience and written the newly published book &lt;span class="mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, which came out on September 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the book, she interviewed other women who had suffered similar health setbacks about their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website women in the book had a common thread: they were 'hearing' the signs of an issue in their bodies but not actually listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez said: 'There's a difference between hearing your body and listening to it, a very big difference.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children between 6 and 12 years old should sleep between nine and 12 hours per night, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Data from the study showed on average, children were got eight hours and 20 minutes, while their parents reported their kids were asleep for more than nine and a half hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What parents often don’t see is how long it takes for kids to fall asleep or how often they wake up during the night,” Diana S. Grigsby-Toussaint, the study’s senior author and an associate professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers deployed wrist-worn accelerometers to track bedtimes and other factors, such as how long it took children to fall asleep, how frequently they woke up, and the time they actually spent sleeping, according to Brown. Meanwhile, parents completed surveys and kept daily sleep diaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Children were awake for an average of more than 38 minutes per night, while parents reported under five minutes of nighttime wakefulness for their children,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The data also found disparities among ethnicities: Fifty six percent of the study participants were Latino, and those children averaged a little more than eight hours of sleep per night while the non-Latino participants averaged eight and a half, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;More than 22 percent of non-Latino participants met sleep guidelines, but only 4.4 percent of Latino participants did, according to researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The study also explored whether parents were aware of problems related to sleep. Latino caregivers, for instance, were more likely than other groups to report that sleep was a concern, and to say their child had trouble staying asleep. Meanwhile, non-Latino parents tended to underreport sleep problems,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Parents in both groups tended to overestimate how much sleep their kids were getting,” they said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers noted cultural factors could have played a role in the findings, as later bedtimes, co-sleeping, and room sharing “are more common in Latino households” and “might influence both sleep behavior and parental perceptions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our work indicates that we need to improve our communication about sleep with families to capture the multiple dimensions of it,” Grigsby-Toussaint said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another factor in play: the wrist devices used in the study have limitations, according to researchers. They “don’t always distinguish between periods of wakeful rest and sleep,” officials said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This means that the tracking devices, too, could over-estimate children’s sleep volume,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To improve their children’s sleep, parents can follow “tried-and-true sleep tips,” including “bedtime routines, maintaining consistent sleep and wake schedules — even on the weekends — encouraging physical activity and exposure to natural light and green spaces during the day, limiting screens close to bedtime, and creating a comfortable sleep environment,” Grigsby-Toussaint said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

When energy demand spikes, neurons even create their own fats by recycling parts of themselves, a process dependent on a key protein called DDHD2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 54 (HSP54), DDHD2 malfunctions, cutting off this energy source and impairing neuron function. Remarkably, researchers found that providing neurons with special fatty acids restored their energy production and activity within just 48 hours, offering new hope for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat-Fueled Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons can generate and burn their own fats for energy, overturning decades of neuroscience dogma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein DDHD2:&lt;/strong&gt; Essential for neuron lipid metabolism; its dysfunction causes severe movement and cognitive decline in HSP54.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatty acid supplements restored function in damaged neurons, pointing to a potential treatment path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists from the University of Queensland (Australia) and the University of Helsinki (Finland) have found that, contrary to what was long believed, neurons don’t just rely on sugar for energy—they can burn fat too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more fascinating, when energy demands are high, neurons create their own fats by recycling their own cell parts.

But this discovery brings hope: by giving damaged neurons grown in the laboratory special fatty acid supplements, researchers were able to restore their energy production and function, in just 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a real game-changer,” said Dr Merja Joensuu, who conceived the project and led the study at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown that healthy neurons rely on fats for fuel, and when this pathway fails in conditions like HSP54, it may be possible to repair the damage and reverse the neuropathologies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technologies give hope &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now moving to the next stage: testing whether these fatty acid-based therapies are safe and effective in pre-clinical models, a necessary step before clinical trials in humans, and whether this fat-fueled brain pathway could help treat other, previously untreatable, brain diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will continue the exciting collaboration with new non-invasive technologies to image the brain and therefore aid a faster development of the potential therapy.  This breakthrough doesn’t just rewrite the textbooks, it could transform lives” Dr Giuseppe Balistreri from the University of Helsinki says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759768811101"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about neuron metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They found that neurons can burn fat for fuel, not just sugar, and can even produce their own fats during high energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759769303521"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is the DDHD2 protein important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; DDHD2 enables neurons to recycle cellular components to create fats for energy; without it, energy production fails, leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759769318906"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could this discovery impact patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; By restoring fat metabolism with fatty acid therapies, scientists may be able to reverse neuron damage in conditions like HSP54 and possibly other brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience, neurology, and metabolism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a3d3cac28dd3d6d1d1c2e3cbc6cfd0cacdc8ca8dc5ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pia Purra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://helsinki.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Pia Purra – University of Helsinki&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01367-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DDHD2 provides a flux of saturated fatty acids for neuronal energy and function&lt;/a&gt;” by Giuseppe Balistreri. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDHD2 provides a flux of saturated fatty acids for neuronal energy and function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fatty acids support mitochondrial ATP production in most tissues, neurons are believed to rely exclusively on glucose for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that genetic ablation of the triglyceride and phospholipid lipase &lt;em&gt;Ddhd2&lt;/em&gt; impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in cultured neurons, despite increased glycolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This defect arises from reduced levels of long-chain saturated free fatty acids, particularly myristic, palmitic and stearic acids, normally released in an activity-dependent manner by Ddhd2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid import in wild-type neurons similarly reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Saturated fatty acyl-coenzyme A treatment restored mitochondrial energy production in &lt;em&gt;Ddhd2&lt;/em&gt; knockout neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When provided in combination, these activated fatty acyl-CoA supplements also rescued defects in membrane trafficking, synaptic function and protein homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings uncover that neurons perform β-oxidation of endogenous long-chain free fatty acids to meet ATP demands and reveal a potential therapeutic strategy for hereditary spastic paraplegia 54 caused by &lt;em&gt;DDHD2&lt;/em&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:56:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE52bmwzanM1WnRUUnU5ejNwMWZYekEwS1JxOGhqZkJyRTNPd1Z4ei13MFVEQXM5N0VJN1VIa2FFeXZ6V0dYczBkSUxvU19rMkNwbE5Jc3NveXRvX3lTOU5uMTlGXzl1VW9Kd2Y3M3JWZlg</guid></item><item><title>美国疾病控制与预防中心宣布更改新冠肺炎疫苗和水痘疫苗建议-《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-06/cdc-covid-chickenpox-vaccine-recommendations-change</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced changes to the recommended vaccination schedule for adults against COVID-19 and for kids against chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes were expected and were already previewed by recommendations &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-19/cdc-committee-votes-on-covid-19"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago by the CDC’s powerful Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. All members of the committee  were recently replaced after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired everyone on the previous panel earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s changes  have been criticized by mainstream medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is now recommending that children under the age of 4 no longer get a combination vaccine that protects against four diseases: the chickenpox (also known as varicella), measles, mumps and rubella. Instead, the CDC now recommends two separate shots, one just against chickenpox, and the other that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has also now officially lifted its recommendation that adults under age 65 get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC now says the decision on whether an adult under age 65 gets a COVID-19 vaccine should be based on “individual-based decision-making” in consultation with health professionals like a physician, nurse or pharmacist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches a change in recommendations made to the childhood vaccination schedule earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by acting CDC director Jim O’Neill, a top deputy to Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic. O’Neill replaced Susan Monarez, who was fired as CDC director after 29 days on the job. Monarez said she was terminated after she pushed back against an effort by her bosses to undermine vaccines; Kennedy said she was fired because she said she was not trustworthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill has no training in medicine or healthcare and holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in humanities, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/jim-oneill-cdc-kennedy-trump-vaccines-58fd24f678bf46ea6ec96a2b09f85ff4" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, and is a former investor who has been a critic of health regulations. He has previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services, serving six years under President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill’s announcement said that the changes will still allow for immunization coverage to continue through programs including  the Vaccines for Children program, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy for Pediatrics in late September criticized the change, which removed the option for toddlers to get a single shot that can protect against chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting CDC director’s statement, issued by the press office of the Department of Health and Human Services, raised concerns about an increased risk of febrile seizure caused by fever after getting the combined chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (known as MMRV) versus those given the chickenpox vaccine separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics said that in a meeting last month, some of the CDC’s new vaccine advisors “at times...misrepresented data and used talking points common among anti-vaccine groups. Some seemed unfamiliar with febrile seizures. They also disregarded CDC assurances that febrile seizures after MMRV are rare and do not have long-term impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that all adults get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, especially those with risk conditions and people who have never gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health has slightly different &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/public-health-for-all/publichealthforall.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The agency recommends that adults younger than 65 with risk factors get the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as all adults who are in close contact with others with risk factors, and everyone who chooses to get vaccinated. The agency also recommends that all seniors get vaccinated against COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:52:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZURMTmpNQnh5ZGp1RFFFUUN5NnMyUGVRd0k0b3ZfQXB4XzFIS1g5T0wtZEs2SmQ1c0h5ZVgzS19kNzh5Y1hzbjJNVlJuUnk5YnVuQ01Gc01nb0hCcTJ6SGtzZ0laMGFUREoxbVB6ZHE4U3NCaFgwbkRUalE4VmRFbi1mQm05SzdEeWRfX0J3dHpRTzJLUzNIUWNDbFc3THp6ZnQ0Rk9R</guid></item></channel></rss>
