Dunking your spuds in a deep fryer might be a recipe for elevating your risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac8c8" class="body-graf"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-082121" target="_blank"&gt;study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ, swapping out your weekly dose of frites for boiled, baked or mashed potatoes could lower your risk of this chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33060" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors examined the diets of more than 205,000 adults in the U.S. who responded to questionnaires about what they ate over nearly four decades. Among those who consumed potatoes, the authors looked at which people developed Type 2 diabetes, a disease that leads to persistently high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f12bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating three weekly servings of french fries, they found, was associated with a 20% increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. But consuming the same amount of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes did not appear to be linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467012" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank"&gt;vast majority&lt;/a&gt; of the 1 in 10 people with diabetes in the U.S. have Type 2. The condition can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes or kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5fd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings underscore that the way foods are prepared is key to their overall health risks or benefits, said Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, the study’s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-575681" class="body-graf"&gt;“Not all potatoes are created equal,” he said. “Even a small amount of french fries, less than one serving in the week, is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd1aa6" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike boiled or baked potatoes, french fries are deep-fried in oils that usually contain trans or saturated fats. The way the body metabolizes those fats can contribute to insulin resistance — when cells don’t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Regular consumption of fried foods can also lead to obesity and inflammation, both of which raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796089" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you fry the potatoes, the energy content — calories — increases because of the fat they absorb. If you eat many servings of french fries, it predisposes [people] to weight gain,” said Candida Rebello, the director of the nutrition and chronic disease program at Louisiana State University, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32bfdd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study relied on data collected&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;between 1984 and 2021, when several different frying methods were popular. Most fast-food chains today prepare fries using vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, soybean or peanut oil. But during the 1980s, beef tallow was common. And in the early 1990s, restaurants shifted to partially hydrogenated oils. (The oils were a major source of trans fat in the U.S. diet and were &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat" target="_blank"&gt;largely phased out of the food industry&lt;/a&gt; by 2018.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65f377" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/seed-oil-what-know-tiktok-explained-rcna186659" target="_blank"&gt;the seed oils used today &lt;/a&gt;are &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1848499491151745180?mx=2" target="_blank"&gt;“poisoning” Americans&lt;/a&gt; and contributing to high levels of obesity in children. He has advocated for restaurants to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;switch back to beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;, a recommendation that isn’t backed by scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a1dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Beef tallow is high in saturated fats and other harmful fats. We definitely don’t recommend that,” Mousavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b178ca" class="body-graf"&gt;One limitation of Mousavi’s study is that it did not account for people adding unhealthy ingredients to their boiled, baked or mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032502" class="body-graf"&gt;“What do people add to baked potatoes? Butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream,” said Shannon Galyean, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University, who wasn’t part of the research. “Then we also don’t know, did they eat it with the skins?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb1a43" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said potato skins contain nutrients such as fiber, which helps with blood sugar control. And potatoes, when they aren’t deep-fried or slathered in butter, can be a useful source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-289a33" class="body-graf"&gt;“Definitely, potatoes can be considered a healthy food when you don’t fry it, or when you don’t add lots of fat to it,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc4ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Mousavi said baking french fries at home with a healthier oil, such as olive or avocado oil, could help lower one’s diabetes risk compared to eating them from fast-food restaurants. Swapping out potatoes with whole grains, such as farro or whole-grain bread or pasta, could make an even bigger difference. These foods have a lower glycemic index, meaning they’re less likely to spike blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ea229" class="body-graf"&gt;His study found that whole grains, when compared to all types of potatoes, were less likely to elevate one’s diabetes risk. White rice, on the other hand, had a stronger association with Type 2 diabetes than either of these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6312b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Megan Mulcahy, the director of communications at Potatoes USA, a marketing and research organization that supports potato consumption, said fries can “absolutely be part of a healthy eating pattern when enjoyed in moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5bd44" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said it’s important to consider a person’s overall diet, which has a greater impact on their health than any individual food. Nutritionists generally recommend a colorful plate with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish, beans or nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e31aa" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People don’t eat just one thing; they eat meals,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOYkxLY3lfMU4tYTZoMEJZOUhmdVJpLWxlU1d2WXA0RTdGZ2VacGItU29JTkRESXAyZFlrcmwxeGZLNlUzU0FHa01nUWpvWFpIeFdoUXhvNDhRbVk5VHEycnJxeFZzMFp3QUdGZngwSDQwb2dvQkFmRWNFbDFGU3F1aHVCSjVHLUYzOGFTT0cyeUgzRDBLeGF2NkxTeXVIclYzaU5XNjVvOEd3THc5dmhHOXpB0gFWQVVfeXFMTmtOQzJGTWo4MGJxTVJsLXlaRVJTQndBZUtXMHA2MmN4ZXhDYnNVZ01kWHVuUHJ1eG9YLURqb1hsSXRuVzVucjFwRmZmV0JJbjFBQjBKQ3c</guid></item><item><title>关于逆转阿尔茨海默氏症的研究表明，锂是潜在的关键--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQT1VQdGhNelNkMTZMWTRIaDE5eV9xZXl6ampaOWtEWXE5R2hmVjFqWFdnTGZqN3pZSnAxNV9TMVZ2UGJCb2lNYUVJQVlpUWUtNzl0NkxlS0ppWWFCSTM5M3J0VW9QYjgzZkRTVHFvY1AxZ3p6MnM4b0lNSmhCeXYxNzBGMEJtSmtEVTVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JCF6KWU4KFDNVNS3K7KB7LXLCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Seven years of investigation by scientists at Harvard Medical School has revealed that the loss of the metal lithium plays a powerful role in Alzheimer’s disease, a finding that could lead to earlier detection, new treatments and a broader understanding of how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YGLHITQ265DRDPBKCTW4KGTDNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers led by Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, reported that they were able to reverse the disease in mice and restore brain function with small amounts of the compound lithium orotate, enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain. Their study appeared Wednesday in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EB4MSG4DZNC4HHYF3XTPKBP6HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly,” said Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXKVHM6ZRJB55LJK27E4ELPV64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, said: “I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans.” He added that the findings still need to be validated by other labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DHATDXAVV5HCPCBXRVXYPZ5DLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although there have been recent breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, no medication has succeeded in stopping or reversing the disease that afflicts more than 7 million Americans, a number projected to reach almost 13 million by 2050, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures?utm_source=google-grant&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_grant&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=42054366&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqKzEBhANEiwAeQaPVUjBaDn58VEfdFkEC4B0qUR6WsJTK8H1CbpNhyX3SHj3bahuhKGLnRoCSTQQAvD_BwE#quickFacts" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYH2DMX3SNDVBDM2AAVDEW33MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lithium is widely prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder, and previous research indicated that it held potential as an Alzheimer’s treatment and an antiaging medication. A 2017 study in Denmark suggested the presence of lithium in drinking water  might be associated with a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K66TNJRMKJBZLLBJJHQFOOUFSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, the new work is the first to describe the specific roles that lithium plays in the brain, its influence on all of the brain’s major cell types and the effect that its deficiency later in life has on aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3AUKWROFEBFKJN6A4UUPUIE5TE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Results of the study by Yankner’s lab and researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Chicago also suggest that measuring lithium levels might help doctors screen people for signs of Alzheimer’s years before the first symptoms begin to appear. Yankner said doctors might be able to measure lithium levels in the cerebrospinal fluid or blood, or through brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="K6Q5YHXHXBAABPH5QPH5WAQS24" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="K6Q5YHXHXBAABPH5QPH5WAQS24" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How our brains use lithium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH3BMV6SIZHYNNEKL3ZKYE3JHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a healthy brain, lithium maintains the connections and communication lines that allow neurons to talk with one another.

                A researcher works at the Moderna headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. In May the Trump administration pulled over $700 million committed to Moderna for developing future flu vaccines and this week it cancelled another $500 million in grants to various institutions researching mRNA vaccines.

   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is cancelling almost $500 million in contracts to develop mRNA vaccines to protect the nation against future viral threats. The move thrilled critics of the technology but horrified many public health and biosecurity experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal &lt;a href="https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda" target="_blank"&gt;Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority&lt;/a&gt;, or BARDA, which oversees the nation's defenses against biological attacks, is terminating 22 contracts with university researchers and private companies to develop new uses for the mRNA technology, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology was used by the first Trump administration to create the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, which are widely considered a medical triumph that safely and effectively saved millions of lives. But vaccine mandates during the pandemic sowed fierce antipathy towards the technology, leading to widespread public opposition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants one," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;explaining the&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt; decision&lt;/a&gt;. "That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA vaccines for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The announcement dismayed many who study infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This may be the most dangerous public health judgment that I've seen in my 50 years in this business," says &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "It is baseless and we will pay a tremendous price in terms of illnesses and deaths. I'm extremely worried about it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the decision was welcomed by vaccine critics like the group &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Children's Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;, which Kennedy himself founded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While we believe the mRNA vaccines should be taken off the market, the announcement is a positive move towards protecting public health," said Mary Holland, the group's president and CEO, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo&lt;/a&gt; strongly disagrees. She runs the Brown University School of Public Health Pandemic Center, and says the move could erode preparedness for future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a profoundly disappointing development," she says. "When there's the next pandemic, we're going to be caught flat-footed. It absolutely leaves the country vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nuzzo and others aren't just worried about the next pandemic. Many experts say mRNA vaccines would provide a crucial deterrent and powerful defense against bioterrorists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think that it endangers the national security of the United States," says &lt;a href="https://www.raymondjames.com/corporations-and-institutions/global-equities-and-investment-banking/equity-research/equity-research-team/bio?id=4ee72beb8f904b708356c8e2867bf126&amp;amp;bioListId=39377c2ba1e4492a87cac2836d0838f6" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Meekins&lt;/a&gt;, a top biodefense official in the first Trump administration. "It could put the US at a strategic national security disadvantage and would be a significant threat to the national security of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In announcing his decision, Kennedy claimed the COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe, ineffective, helped drive the evolution of the virus and could not keep up with new mutations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits against these respiratory viruses," Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many outside experts say Kennedy's claims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"His science is backwards, as it often is," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/peter-hotez-23229" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Hotez&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Baylor College of Medicine who runs the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. "This is a proven technology for emerging respiratory viruses or respiratory virus pandemics. It is extremely safe and has been incredibly effective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines work by stimulating the immune system with a key protein from a virus. Kennedy says the federal government is instead investing in an alternative technology that uses whole killed viruses and can produce "natural immunity."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While that technology has produced effective vaccines, it's a much older approach that can have safety issues and is not nearly as nimble in responding to new threats, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is irresponsible to strip funding from future technologies with great potential and shift it towards outdated old fashioned technologies," says &lt;a href="https://www.xprize.org/about/people/rick-bright" target="_blank"&gt;Rick Bright&lt;/a&gt;, who ran BARDA during the first Trump administration. "We're taking our country from 2025 back to 1940 and we all know that's a recipe for disaster and failure."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology is the only vaccine technology that can be developed quickly enough to respond swiftly to a new pathogenic threat, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In an outbreak, when you are facing a rapidly spreading virus – whether it's from nature or a nation-state adversary – speed is the name of the game," Bright says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" target="_blank"&gt;previously cancelled&lt;/a&gt; a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many fear moves like this will continue to undermine public trust in vaccines generally and mRNA technology specifically, which is also showing promise for treating diseases, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The deleterious impact is not only in the contracts that they're canceling but they're trying to make the case to the public that mRNA technology doesn't work very well and it's unsafe," Hotez says. "And that's absolutely untrue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What I'm seeing in my own practice mirrors the surge my colleagues are reporting nationwide,' she told&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/well/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt; The New York Times. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD is caused by the virus coxsackievirus 16 and there is no vaccine for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be passed through the air or by coming into close contact with a person who hasn't washed their hands after using the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD infections tend to spike in the summer and early fall because children are more likely to mix in environments where the disease can spread, such as at summer camps, pools and theme parks, as well as the start of school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies also suggest that warmer and more humid weather in the summer months may be more favorable for the survival and transmission of the viruses that cause HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD typically causes fever, vomiting and a rash covering the mouth, hands and feet that clears up within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in very young patients, the illness can be much more serious and lead to seizures, triggered by inflammation of the fluid surrounding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is highly transmissible, spread via contact with fluids from an infected person, such as from blisters, and by swallowing infected water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that water parks can spread the highly contagious disease if their water has not been treated properly, leaving children at risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Philadelphia, a water park was&lt;span&gt; closed for a day in July after a child who had visited the location contracted HFMD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that water parks can spread the highly contagious disease if their water has not been treated properly, leaving youngsters at risk of infection (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 10 to 15million cases of HFMD are recorded in the US every year, estimates suggest, mostly among children under five years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who are infected are recommended to take over-the-counter pain medications to help relieve fever and pain caused by mouth sores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are also told to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration, saying this may happen because mouth sores make it painful to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children diagnosed with the disease should avoid contact with others for at least seven days in order to dodge them spreading the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:37:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>关于新陈代谢的3个误区可能会阻碍您- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPRG11RkdRQkF3MGtuTklqUXN5VUZ0dWd2X0h1bFB3Y1NjOVpBTV9Ud250ZnF2aTBBc0ZCOWtWTTFwcTEwbFJGZkNxRVkwMDlQZFlmdFZXZGZqVjZTOGVPaU9fY3hqdHQ3dkx3WTJrRExfQjk1MEc3N1ZneGd2bDNXMtIBhgFBVV95cUxNNFZBOGUxb2xFUkROYjdIdDFhbFBzRHVtZW5CWk5JVVo0OWMyU3JEaS1GTUFUSlBXb2l3YlJtdzVOSWJDWjRmZGhJcGZic0Ffbk5CUFFNc1RKVTAyRktVMHVLb0dlaXF5Rk1iWEl1NFBIMVl1MHJLaDFTb3BQcUhVYVVKdzlGZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN)— &lt;/strong&gt;Think speeding up your metabolism is key to losing weight? Metabolism has grown into one of the biggest buzzwords in the wellness industry — a tricky code that, if deciphered, is believed to unlock the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/weight-loss-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;secrets of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and overall health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz2wxup00003b6mu1389idy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the term’s ubiquity, one scientist says many people don’t understand much of how this basic bodily process works.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000w3b6mhlo8mv10@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They think it has something to do with how much food we can eat without gaining weight or something like that,” Dr. Kevin Hall told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000x3b6mahtpyshj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall wants to elevate metabolism for different reasons. “Metabolism is just this incredible biochemical process that basically turns the food that we eat and the oxygen that we breathe into essentially … everything we are and everything we do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000y3b6m8ooen0kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A leading  nutrition and metabolism scientist, Hall is well-known  for his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/health/biggest-loser-diet-exercise-study/index.html"&gt;research on contestants&lt;/a&gt;  from the reality show “The Biggest Loser” that helped explain what set participants who kept the weight off apart from those who gained it back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000z3b6mqd1jjfnk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spent more than two decades  at the National Institutes of Health. His later work on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/chasing-life/episodes/afe7b592-37bb-11ef-8219-ff42973edcce"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; investigated its link to obesity, including &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrated it actively caused participants to overeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000103b6m3f3gr1la@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall announced his early retirement and exit from NIH in April, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/health/nih-nutrition-researcher-departs"&gt;citing censorship&lt;/a&gt; of how his research findings were communicated. He’s now coauthor of the new book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Intelligence-Science-Nourishes-Harms/dp/059333230X/" target="_blank"&gt;Food Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;: The Science of How Food Both Nourishes and Harms Us” alongside journalist Julia Belluz.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000113b6m5ygw6bk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Metabolism and weight loss enter conversations arm in arm, but this, according to Hall, can be reductive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000123b6msb0zr9ls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just find it incredibly frustrating sometimes that this idea of metabolism, this really beautiful physiological process that is so fundamental to life, is kind of talked about as, ‘Oh well, if you take this supplement, you can boost your metabolism and lose weight,’” he explained to Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000133b6m9qdm2enz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000153b6m63tquybx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Is a faster or higher metabolism really the highway to weight loss? Hall is here to set the record straight, highlighting three misconceptions about metabolism that show there is more to it than meets the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001e3b6myvmmn9ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One common belief is that a slower metabolism results in a higher body weight. But mostly, Hall said, the opposite is true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001f3b6m5xqqe1wz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generally, larger people have faster metabolisms than smaller people,” he told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001g3b6m899xhll2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall attributed the pervasiveness of this myth to the way researchers designed early metabolism studies. Scientists initially tried to match up participants’ caloric intake to their weight, but they didn’t account for the fact that these calorie counts were self-reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001h3b6ma460jyzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turned out that those with obesity often underreported the number of calories they ate to a larger degree than their leaner counterparts. This, Hall said, “led people to a conclusion that, well, if they’re eating less calories and they’re maintaining their weight, then they must be burning less calories. And maybe the reason why they have obesity is because they have slow metabolisms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001i3b6mlp0785r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Modern technology now allows researchers to rely on data, not participants’ own reports. “When we actually directly measure people’s metabolisms, people with obesity have higher metabolic rates on average than people who are lean,” Hall noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001j3b6msbog7o2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the myth that we should be boosting metabolism to treat obesity has stubbornly persisted — and has at times led to deadly consequences. When Stanford University researchers discovered that the chemical compound 2,4-dinitrophenol, or DNP, increased metabolism levels in the 1930s, they enthusiastically promoted it as a safe and effective tool for treating obesity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001k3b6mt45b757p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While DNP did boost metabolism, it also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3550200/" target="_blank"&gt;led to side effects&lt;/a&gt; that included blindness and death, causing federal drug regulators to quickly withdraw it from the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001l3b6m19uwfrjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Maybe,” Hall suggested, “it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise later to realize that with something so fundamentally important to life as metabolism, you can’t just turn it up and turn it down with a pharmaceutical drug and not expect some pretty severe side effects, including death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001m3b6mzk6u7ojq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like weight, age might not affect metabolism as much as you may assume.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001n3b6me1wuuol2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It turns out that until you get to very advanced ages, we’re talking 70s and 80s, it looks like our metabolic rate is roughly constant,” Hall said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001o3b6ms1qin2jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are, of course, changes in the aging body that can impact metabolic rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001p3b6mladievcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People “past the age of 30 or so,” Hall said, are “tending to lose muscle mass or tending to lose lean mass, and they’re tending to gain fat mass. And that alone is anticipated to result in a lower metabolism.” That’s because lean muscle burns more calories than fat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001q3b6mmw1peqrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s these age-related changes — that are not inevitable — and not age itself, that influence one’s metabolism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001r3b6mk6i2e0i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Once you get rid of that effect … it doesn’t seem like there’s a fundamental aging effect to slow metabolism as, as we get older,” Hall concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001s3b6mq1im4tbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A couple ways to combat the loss of lean muscle mass as you age is by engaging in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/health/exercises-for-aging-bodies-wellness"&gt;twice-a-week strength training&lt;/a&gt; and getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/how-to-eat-more-protein-diet-wellness"&gt;protein in your diet&lt;/a&gt; (but no need to go overboard).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001t3b6m9tmzsxao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another pillar of metabolism mythology is the idea that a slow metabolism is the enemy of continued weight loss. Interventions such as dieting are believed to slow metabolism to the point that you can’t lose any additional weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001u3b6m5ipjwdx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But keeping your metabolism from slowing down isn’t the key to sustained weight loss, Hall said. In fact, it’s just the opposite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001v3b6m6xflfoct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The people who are most successful at losing weight and keeping it off are the ones who sport the slowest metabolisms or the greatest reductions in metabolism,” he said. “It’s kind of like stretching a spring, right?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001w3b6murqlyx8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The more intensely someone diets or exercises, the more weight they’ll lose and the more their metabolism will slow down, he explained in his book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001x3b6mjhsus8kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall’s research showed that a slower metabolism “didn’t seem to determine anyone’s ability to lose weight or keep it off in the short or long run.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001y3b6mzey7r2qc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By uncoupling metabolism from the weight loss conversation, Hall said he hopes everyone can appreciate the phenomenon for what it really is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001z3b6mqmeau0qa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation about metabolism “has really distracted people, I think, from the real beauty of what this is,” he told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w500203b6mtbr5o6xn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s harnessing the continuous flow of matter and energy in our food and in our breath and powering every cell in our body, as well as the bodies and cells of practically every organism that we have ever encountered,” Hall said. “It’s a fundamental component of life, and it’s just incredibly fascinating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A genetic cause for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/chronic-fatigue/"&gt;ME&lt;/a&gt; has been found for the first time, proving the illness is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a breakthrough that charities said finally provided “credibility and validity” for sufferers, the University of Edinburgh found eight areas of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/26/human-genetic-code-built-from-scratch-genome-science/"&gt;genetic code&lt;/a&gt; that make a diagnosis more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene activity was seen mainly in the nervous and immune systems, suggesting that people with ME may struggle to clear infections and experience ongoing symptoms of pain, fatigue and illness that other people recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonya Chowdhury, co-investigator on the study and chief executive of Action for ME, said: “For years, many people have been maligned and disbelieved, and our findings will change this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that many people have experienced comments like ‘ME’s not real’. They’ve been to doctors and told that it’s not a real illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to take this study into the treatment room and to say there are genetic causes that play a part in ME is going to be really significant. It will rebuff that lack of belief and stigma that exists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis – which is often known as chronic fatigue syndrome – is a long-term illness characterised by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and may bring malaise after exercise, sleep problems, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt; and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

During her sexual sabbatical, I want to work on something to really wow my wife when she’s back.&lt;/p&gt;

I have purchased a Fleshlight to simulate vaginal penetration, but I wanted to get sex industry insight as to how porn stars are able to prolong their sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

While engaging in sex, are there mental exercises or tools they use to prevent overstimulation/excitation? Or is it mostly an illusion aided by cutscenes, position changes, etc.? Any thoughts would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme064z0t001d3b79ltfjhee6@published"&gt;Male performers in pornography don’t give up their secrets often. The secrets that have been shared with me indicate that each performer uses somewhat different approaches, and that these approaches are simply highly sophisticated versions of the general advice given to men who experience premature ejaculation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme064z0t001e3b79b97w1c5e@published"&gt;You’re headed in the right direction with your thinking of pornography as an entertainment medium. It isn’t so much that position changes allow for an &lt;em&gt;illusion&lt;/em&gt; of lasting longer, though, as it is that interrupting the kind of repetition of stimulation that feels so good it might cause an orgasm interrupts that orgasm. Position changes allow for &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; lasting longer. Slowing down before the point of orgasm also tends to cause that interruption. Taking a break to provide oral stimulation or focus on other parts of your wife’s body will serve that purpose, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme08qe5v00433b79sr7zp8gh@published"&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, yes, use of cutscenes or other creative editing practices can absolutely save a scene that went short or was awkward for any reason, but usually filming runs pretty smoothly with professionals, and if anything, the difficulty occurs when it’s time to ejaculate in a visible and aesthetically pleasing manner. You might watch a few full sex scenes (as opposed to the more common practice of scanning for the couple of minutes that really push your buttons) from couples-oriented or narrative-driven studios with an eye toward what male performers do when they need a break from stimulation of their penis for ideas about how to keep the energy going.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme064z0v001f3b793j0vgkw9@published"&gt;You do have to keep in mind that performers in adult videos are also prioritizing what looks good over what feels good, and achieving the length of time needed for a scene over having the most erotic experience possible. Yes, generally the secondary goal is to experience (and therefore authentically display) pleasure. But it’s a very different main objective than what most people consider when having sex with their partner at home.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme064z0v001g3b79q21ebgx6@published"&gt;If you can get a second erection fairly soon after ejaculating, you might have a quickie with yourself first or come quickly and focus on activities that don’t require an erection during your refractory period. You can experiment with distracting yourself from what your penis is feeling, whether that’s literally baseball or some aspect of the sex you’re experiencing that won’t send you over the edge. And, with your Fleshlight (Disclosure: I’ve had a licensing deal with them for over a decade), you can practice finding the point of no return and then retreating from it so you’re more proficient when you and your wife can return to having sex with each other. (If you’re really stuck on getting info from a pro, my former colleague Erik Everhard has a whole coaching program called The Everhard Academy.)&lt;/p&gt;

The current outbreak is affecting ZIP codes 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039 and the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5ggdr"&gt;Here’s what you need to know now about Legionnaires’ disease, who’s most at risk and what the city is doing to prevent more people from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="ee7f3"&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease and how does it spread?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a85cq"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia that first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/story-of-cdc/legionnaires/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;emerged in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 in an outbreak affecting attendees of an American Legion convention, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2vgfm"&gt;The disease is not spread from person to person, according to the CDC. Instead it’s typically spread by inhaling mist containing Legionella bacteria, which can grow in water systems such as cooling towers, hot tubs and plumbing systems. Typically, Legionella grows in water that’s warm, stagnant or doesn’t contain enough disinfectant, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7evn7"&gt;Window air conditioners are not a source of Legionnaires’ disease, the CDC adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b5qip"&gt;In New York City, hundreds of cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been reported each year for the past decade and cooling towers have become a particular source of concern. They are linked to both the current outbreak and major outbreaks that originated in the Bronx in 2015 and at Amsterdam Nursing Home in Upper Manhattan in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7hsaf"&gt;City officials have emphasized that the current outbreak in Harlem is not tied to issues with buildings’ plumbing systems, so people in the area can safely drink tap water, use their air conditioners, shower and cook as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="dobq2"&gt;What are the symptoms of Legionnaires’ and who’s most at risk?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c33qm"&gt;Not everyone who is exposed to Legionella bacteria develops symptoms and most people are at low risk for the disease, according to city health officials. Symptoms are typically similar to those associated with the flu. They can include cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing, according to the city health department. They can also include headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion or diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8o609"&gt;About 1 in 10 people diagnosed with Legionnaires’ dies from complications of the disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5uh2"&gt;People who are over 50, smoke or have chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems are at higher risk for severe disease, according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1goij"&gt;What should you do if you feel sick?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="58ujc"&gt;New Yorkers with flu-like symptoms should seek medical attention so they can be tested and treated for Legionnaires’ disease, especially if they’re in a high-risk group, according to acting city Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse. Treatment, which may include antibiotics, is particularly effective if the disease is caught early, Morse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="aio2h"&gt;Can Legionnaires’ disease be prevented?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="17dpd"&gt;There’s no vaccine for Legionnaires’, but local lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to try to ensure better maintenance of water cooling towers. After a 2015 outbreak in the Bronx that resulted in 138 cases and 16 deaths, the City Council passed legislation requiring every water cooling tower to be registered with the city and requiring the city to track cooling tower inspections and violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ed5ns"&gt;The number of Legionnaires’ cases reported annually in the city has fluctuated since then. In 2018, more than 600 cases were reported. Last year, there were 257, according to a preliminary count from the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bmurk"&gt;According to the city health department, when &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/environmental/legionnaires-disease-building-evaluations.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two or more cases&lt;/a&gt; of Legionnaires’ are confirmed within a 12-month period that are associated with a particular residential building with a shared hot water system, the city mandates an evaluation of the building’s water system and orders the building owner to notify residents and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="aaqvl"&gt;What is the city doing to contain the current outbreak?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dqntf"&gt;After the city noticed a cluster of Legionnaires’ cases emerging in Harlem last month, officials screened all water cooling towers in the area for Legionella bacteria, according to the city health department. The 11 buildings that tested positive for the bacteria have been ordered to conduct remediation, including cleaning water towers and adjusting chemical solutions as needed, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="90p1n"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department, said officials expect that initial remediation will prevent more people in the area from getting sick. But, she said, it’s likely more cases will be reported before the outbreak is over because the incubation period for Legionnaires’ can delay symptoms by several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="9hq5j"&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;hat are the outstanding questions about the current outbreak?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3e7sc"&gt;The city has not released information on the people who have died from Legionnaires’ in the current outbreak, including their ages or whether they had underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="be06g"&gt;Officials also have not shared the addresses of the 11 buildings in the affected area whose water towers tested positive for Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1s319"&gt;According to Gomez at the city health department, public health lab experts are still working to identify which specific building or buildings caused the current cluster of Legionnaires’ cases. She said those facilities will undergo more thorough remediation once they’re identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ukd8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story has been updated to reflect a third death Tuesday. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 17:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOSW1rMXE4T3JJYWlHcVdvNkM1MnM5RVk5aTc3UXEyQnFxU2FRQTlxUGN2cW52enByZkhxWHd2T0RMRmpJaFRIOWIzOEV4bnM3THNabkRpbDIyNU5KdEczbmdPMGpKUVE0RWRjUlI0ME50cXZJNzhIVjJHWDdOWUtBOTlxRzZTUFBRVEJRWlYwNUpiMlpndzVCcVBxbzRYekxGWTlYQncyQ1U</guid></item><item><title>如果您在睡眠充足的情况下总是感到疲倦，那么您的大脑可能会发出这7个问题的信号- VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOV09UVHlxSDBLRVppbjJlbVp6bmQ4ZWxwYmtDVExCZW1nZmgyQ3FESmQxUHJpb1FFQ1g5VmRjczVzM0NLSDVrU20xMTlkODZMUkpWVEdvbHRxcFY0N1ZtSVhPV043MVFaRlpxbEJNRU45MkNvcWxFeFB4Z2tsd2l0LTF5Zll2OXM3TmlKdnFBbHktQmVFN2NPeXVHeDQ0dU9CQVg4ZS1vQVNUQzVHLVlUa1VmcmRRbzhYT0c2TkJJSm80dUxnZmI0QjlsWkZkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="229" data-end="350"&gt;You know those mornings where you wake up after eight full hours… and still feel like you’ve been hit by a freight train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="352" data-end="392"&gt;Been there. More than I’d like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="620"&gt;At some point, I had to stop blaming my mattress and start paying attention to what else was going on. Because if you're constantly tired even after sleeping "enough," your brain might be throwing up flares — not just fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="622" data-end="752"&gt;Let’s get into the seven most likely reasons your brain is running low on fuel, even when your sleep schedule looks fine on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="759" data-end="799"&gt;1. Your brain is stuck in threat mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="171" data-end="248"&gt;Stress isn’t just a feeling — it’s a state your entire nervous system enters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="250" data-end="418"&gt;Even if your body is lying still in bed, your brain might be on high alert. That’s especially true if you're going through a rough patch or living with chronic anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="420" data-end="485"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://graciousquotes.com/andrew-huberman/?.com"&gt;Dr. Andrew Huberman&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist at Stanford, has stated: “The body and brain respond to any form of stress in the same way, whether it’s psychological or physical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="690" data-end="903"&gt;This underscores how what your brain perceives as stress — whether emotional, cognitive, or physical — triggers the autonomic nervous system into action, keeping you in a heightened state even when you’re resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="905" data-end="1060"&gt;Translation? You might be technically asleep, but your brain is still working overtime. It’s like a fire alarm buzzing quietly in the background all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1163"&gt;If you’re waking up feeling like you’ve run a marathon, your brain may be sleeping with one eye open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1542" data-end="1585"&gt;2. You’re emotionally bottling things up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1587" data-end="1643"&gt;This one surprised me when I first noticed it in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1645" data-end="1820"&gt;I was going through a period where I felt fine during the day, but I’d wake up feeling depleted. Turns out, I wasn’t fine. I just wasn’t dealing with stuff — I was storing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1822" data-end="2050"&gt;Emotional suppression takes energy. You spend your waking hours holding it together, and when your head hits the pillow, your subconscious takes the wheel. It’s not uncommon for the brain to process buried emotions during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="161" data-end="200"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;As sleep researcher Rosalind Cartwright noted: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;“In the healthy person, dreams regulate mood.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;This is based on her studies showing that dreaming helps &lt;a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/13/the-twenty-four-hour-mind-rosalind-cartwright/?.com"&gt;down‑regulate negative emotions&lt;/a&gt; overnight and supports emotional recovery after life stress, like divorce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2167" data-end="2250"&gt;That could explain those vivid dreams or unexplained exhaustion after “good” sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2252" data-end="2460"&gt;Ask yourself: are you giving yourself enough space to process what you’re feeling? Journaling, talking to a friend, or even just naming what’s bothering you can reduce the weight your brain carries overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2467" data-end="2512"&gt;3. You’re overloaded with decision fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2514" data-end="2598"&gt;Ever been to a diner with 15 pages of menu options and left feeling weirdly drained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2600" data-end="2637"&gt;Now imagine that’s your &lt;em data-start="2624" data-end="2636"&gt;whole life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2829"&gt;We’re exposed to more choices in a day than our ancestors faced in a month — what to wear, what to eat, what to watch, what app to use. And every decision, big or small, costs mental energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2831" data-end="2983"&gt;This cognitive drain doesn't necessarily stop when you're asleep. If your days are mentally chaotic, your brain might not be getting the break it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2985" data-end="3171"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but during a solo trip through Vietnam, I packed light and kept my decisions minimal. My energy shot up. Simplicity isn’t just an aesthetic — it’s brain fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3173" data-end="3299"&gt;Consider limiting small decisions with things like meal prepping, outfit planning, or app blocking. Your brain will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3306" data-end="3359"&gt;4. You’re mentally bored — and your brain knows it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3361" data-end="3444"&gt;It sounds counterintuitive, but being under-stimulated can leave you exhausted too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3446" data-end="3646"&gt;If your daily routine feels like autopilot, your brain might be checking out. And when it does, it looks for stimulation elsewhere — often through overthinking, worry loops, or compulsive screen time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="122" data-end="161"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;As Dr. Judson Brewer, addiction psychiatrist and neuroscientist behind &lt;a href="https://www.bookey.app/book/the-craving-mind/quote?.com"&gt;The Craving Mind&lt;/a&gt;, puts it: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;“The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="122" data-end="161"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;This succinctly captures how when our environment feels dull, the brain kicks into craving mode to seek something rewarding, even if that means anxious thought loops or distraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3884" data-end="4069"&gt;I once spent two weeks doing repetitive freelance editing work that paid well but bored me to death. I got nine hours of sleep each night, but woke up tired every day. No mystery there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4071" data-end="4253"&gt;Inject something mentally nourishing into your routine — a podcast, a challenging hobby, or conversations that actually stretch you. Your energy might rebound faster than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4260" data-end="4302"&gt;5. Your dopamine system is out of whack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4304" data-end="4396"&gt;Let’s talk about dopamine — the brain chemical responsible for motivation, reward, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4398" data-end="4540"&gt;Thanks to the internet, we’re swimming in dopamine spikes: notifications, fast-paced videos, endless scrolls. But those spikes come at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4542" data-end="4801"&gt;If your dopamine system gets overstimulated, your brain reduces its sensitivity to it. That can leave you feeling flatlined — not just emotionally, but physically. Motivation dips. Energy tanks. Even after sleep, you feel like you’re walking through molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4803" data-end="4834"&gt;The solution? Dopamine balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4836" data-end="5025"&gt;Cut down on artificial highs and give your brain time to reset. Long walks without your phone, reading instead of bingeing, or spacing out your tech use can all help regulate your baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5027" data-end="5173"&gt;I've tried dopamine fasts before, and while they sound intense, even a day without stimulation can make your baseline energy feel more… available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5180" data-end="5234"&gt;6. You’re chronically disconnected from your values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5236" data-end="5255"&gt;This one hits deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5257" data-end="5423"&gt;You can be doing everything “right” — eating healthy, sleeping well, exercising — but still feel tired if your days are out of sync with what actually matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5425" data-end="5557"&gt;Psychological dissonance (aka living out of alignment with your values) can be subtle. You might not notice it, but your brain does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5559" data-end="5781"&gt;Let’s say creativity is important to you, but your job doesn’t allow for it. Or connection is a priority, but your days are filled with solo tasks. Over time, that creates a low-grade exhaustion that sleep alone can’t fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5783" data-end="5971"&gt;I’ve felt this most when I’ve said yes to too many things that didn’t feel like me. It’s sneaky. But once I realigned — even slightly — with what I actually cared about, my energy shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5973" data-end="6059"&gt;Check in: Are you spending time on things that reflect who you are and what you value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6066" data-end="6102"&gt;7. You’re ignoring mental clutter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6104" data-end="6153"&gt;Last one — and it’s probably the most overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6155" data-end="6393"&gt;Mental clutter is like having 37 open tabs in your brain. Not necessarily urgent stuff, just... lingering. That email you keep meaning to send. That unresolved conflict. That subscription you need to cancel. That goal you keep postponing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6395" data-end="6460"&gt;These unclosed loops burn mental bandwidth, even while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6462" data-end="6504"&gt;As productivity expert David Allen put it: “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6559" data-end="6721"&gt;One trick that’s worked for me: a weekly “mental dump.” I jot down every to-do, nagging thought, or loose end. Then I either schedule it, delete it, or let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6723" data-end="6793"&gt;The clearer your mind, the better your brain can rest. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6800" data-end="6818"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6820" data-end="6942"&gt;If you’re always feeling tired despite getting enough sleep, it’s probably not just about rest — it’s about &lt;em data-start="6928" data-end="6941"&gt;restoration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6944" data-end="7078"&gt;Your brain needs more than hours on a pillow. It needs emotional release, mental clarity, alignment, and recovery from constant input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7080" data-end="7138"&gt;Start small. Pick one thing from this list and experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7140" data-end="7245"&gt;Energy isn’t just physical — it’s psychological. And your brain? It’s smarter than we give it credit for.&lt;/p&gt;

On Reddit, posters &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1ixuhgl/does_life_seem_to_be_losing_its_color_to_you/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observe&lt;/a&gt;: “As I get older it feels like life is losing its color,” and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1i8gnow/are_your_colors_getting_dull/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt;: “Were colors brighter and more vibrant when I was younger?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Indeed, according to &lt;a href="https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/colour-shape-using-computer-vision-to-explore-the-science-museum-c4b4f1cbd72c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the UK’s Science Museum Group, there’s been a stark increase in gray everyday objects since the mid-20th century. But this dullification may go beyond the modern preponderance of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/everything-in-our-world-is-grey-how-did-we-come-to-this" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ashen cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/09/the-sad-beige-aesthetic-why-has-the-world-suddenly-turned-taupe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sad beige nurseries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/what-is-millennial-gray-8667084" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;millennial gray apartments&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists believe that color perception itself can fade, altering how the world appears. Depending on how your eyes – and brain – age, the bright red balloon you remember from your seventh birthday party might not look as vivid if you came across it again at 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"wellness/series/the-joys-of-aging","type":"Series","title":"The joys of ageing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/adrienne-matei","type":"Contributor","title":"Adrienne Matei","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/21/Adrienne_Matei.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9ee51ef2fe3b53e603b2774c3b8cf1be"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/aug/06/ageing-color-perception","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changes in color perception can occur for several reasons. One common factor is structural shifts in the eye. For instance, a cataract – a condition that clouds the eye’s lens – can gradually tint vision with a yellow-brown “brunescent” hue. In the US, about &lt;a href="https://eye.ufl.edu/2024/10/02/are-you-one-of-the-millions-about-to-have-cataract-surgery-heres-what-ophthalmologists-say-you-need-to-know/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;4m&lt;/a&gt; cataract surgeries are performed annually. A brunescent lens “can pull the blue and green out” of the world around us, says Dr Andrew Iwach of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. After a cataract is removed, the difference in color clarity afterward can be so striking that Iwach wears a bright blue tie to delight his recovering patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why it’s important to protect your hearing as you age – and what experts suggest","elementId":"61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changes in color perception can also be caused by glaucoma or macular degeneration. Iwach recommends &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/salud-ocular/consejos/eye-exams-101" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine eye exams&lt;/a&gt;, and says if you notice this type of change, see an ophthalmologist. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/05/treating-eyesight-issues-could-prevent-one-in-five-dementia-cases-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research from 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 15% of global dementia cases could be linked to problems with color perception issues, meaning that an eye exam can be an important step in screening and mitigating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some medications can also affect color perception, says Iwach – namely Viagra (pilots are &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/pharm/ed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; to abstain from the drug eight hours before flying lest it affect their perception of blue hues) and some types of heart and tuberculosis medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet research suggests that even in the absence of eye disease or medication use, color perception can shift over the course of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Janneke van Leeuwen, a social neuroscientist and honorary research fellow at University College London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, noticed a subtle trend in behavioral studies from the last three decades: older adults &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/col.5080180606" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consistently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/1350946296000018?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; colors duller than younger participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Van Leeuwen set out to investigate: do we truly see the world differently as we age?

They found a reduction in the way older people’s pupils responded to more highly saturated colors, even when correcting for the shrunken baseline pupil sizes that come with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Thus, it seems some older adults may genuinely perceive the world as less colorful. Van Leeuwen recalls one participant saying: “Oh, it’s a shame there’s not a real punchy red.” “I was thinking: ‘Well, you’re looking at one!’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The issue, Van Leeuwen explains, “doesn’t necessarily originate in the eyes, but in the brain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pupil responses are controlled by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, a midbrain structure that receives input from the retina and the visual cortex.

More research is needed to understand why, but the cause probably lies in how the cones in our eyes interact with color-processing pathways in the brain. Currently, Van Leeuwen is following up her study with an investigation into how differences in saturation perception influence the way colors make younger and older adults feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bebe5a74-77d1-46e1-a0a0-f7747d4a54a4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m an expert on ageing.

Believed to be an evolutionary trait for important evaluations such as the ripeness of fruit, this effect also takes place in the primary visual cortex. This “further supports our findings that the decline in sensitivity in color saturation in healthy ageing originates in the brain, and not the eyes”, says Van Leeuwen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no sign this loss of saturation perception follows the same process as the onset of certain types of dementia, Van Leeuwen emphasizes – many older adults experience vision declines without developing dementia, which has multiple risk factors. However, the study does provide insight into how our brains change as a result of normal, healthy ageing, which is useful context in the study of neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Is there anything you can do to stop age-related declines in saturation perception? Researchers don’t currently believe that lifestyle habits can meaningfully influence this process. But there’s some evidence that the brain can be “trained” to see the world differently. Anya Hurlbert, a color and vision scientist at Newcastle University, points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30741-7.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; involving EnChroma glasses, which feature a saturation-boosting tint to help reduce the effects of some types of color blindness. Participants with red-green color perception deficiencies who wore the glasses reported seeing increased color saturation even after removing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, simply surrounding oneself with more intense colors could help. As Van Leeuwen notes, “Older adults tend to evaluate more saturated colors more positively than younger adults … which seems to suggest they might need the extra stimulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just another reason to see the new Wes Anderson movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE52MVFUOWJWcF94dGJ5VG00cjhXZ2VMcFBKdHA0TnN3bVhjVTg0a3lYa1ljMkJHZk5LVXRLS2IxTUh6MUVVVmdWeV9TN1NjN2I2MXgtTUZjTzY1aVBFUFZOcWpOLTZpQ3IwanVScURpMmlZeGlpcldkX29zMTk</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚对3万只蚊子进行了测试，以验证一种新型驱蚊剂的有效性，而且非常有效。- evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPSUMwSnBjZkNTX256UFVoT19HaUlRZUZNdXZoRF8xVW51V3JqS3VBNE5pQmxwanpidm43WDgzVmFrbjBKNHVyVEJjUkdXd194VHR6eTJNMEdnRFNqZ2IzSmhlX0ZScUdHa3pPV29uaXotRlc3RXJhNzBkZUNHaTFCRjVLUlM5MXRqY2JsSUc0MVU2ejd3Rjl2c01FZkRZS0ZVeWVsWEdkQ1dtZ3hGZDJzM0V0NHA2X1pXTGZDR3lSSVAwMzlLYnBhT2NLbF9BTWRtRmZyOU56OERnU3I5VGJzWnc4UUh5RlpETXByTlExdVZZTWpYTll4bXpmSUJmUndZU0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle against mosquitoes has intensified in recent years, particularly against the tiger mosquito species that poses significant health risks. A groundbreaking natural repellent has shown remarkable effectiveness in an extreme test involving thousands of these persistent pests. This innovative solution offers new hope for those seeking chemical-free protection during mosquito season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revolutionary natural mosquito repellent undergoes extreme testing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an extraordinary demonstration of confidence, a researcher in Guadeloupe recently subjected herself to a challenging test that few would dare attempt. Marie Modeste, a molecular biotechnology researcher, entered a sealed cage containing 32,000 hungry tiger mosquitoes after applying a natural repellent called Kreopik to her entire body. This test represents one of the most extreme evaluations of a mosquito repellent ever conducted.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The experiment began with a control test where Modeste inserted her arm into a small hermetic cage without any protection. As expected, this resulted in multiple bites. The main test followed, with the researcher entering a 3×3 meter sealed enclosure containing thousands of hungry insects that had been deprived of food for over eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending more than twenty minutes surrounded by the aggressive insects, Modeste emerged completely bite-free. While the experience was described as uncomfortable, the &lt;strong&gt;natural repellent’s effectiveness against tiger mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; was conclusively demonstrated under extreme conditions that far exceed what anyone would encounter in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This remarkable test shows promising results in our ongoing battle against disease vectors. Much like how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise helps combat serious diseases like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, natural solutions can offer protection against insect-borne illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Locally sourced ingredients power effective protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes Kreopik particularly noteworthy is its 100% natural composition based on locally sourced ingredients from Guadeloupe. The research team developed this repellent using a blend of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential oils with natural repellent properties&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shea butter for smooth application and skin nourishment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cocoa butter providing lasting protection and moisturization&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other natural botanical ingredients native to the region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://la1ere.franceinfo.fr/guadeloupe/lutte-contre-les-moustiques-un-test-a-grande-echelle-avec-30-000-moustiques-tigres-1595688.html"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;strong&gt;natural tiger mosquito deterrent&lt;/strong&gt; represents a significant advancement in mosquito protection because it eliminates concerns about chemical exposure. Many conventional repellents contain DEET and other synthetic compounds that can cause skin irritation or raise health concerns, especially with frequent application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research into natural repellents has gained momentum as public health concerns about mosquito-borne diseases increase. The spread of tiger mosquitoes resembles how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-gene-has-given-the-black-plague-a-unique-adaptation-capacity/"&gt;certain diseases adapt and spread through genetic advantages&lt;/a&gt;, making effective countermeasures increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind Kreopik are now expanding their work to develop a 100% natural herbicide, demonstrating a broader commitment to creating environmentally friendly solutions for common problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing natural versus chemical repellents&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Features&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Natural Repellents&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Chemical Repellents&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Skin Sensitivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Generally gentle, moisturizing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;May cause irritation or allergic reactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Biodegradable, eco-friendly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Potential water and soil contamination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Duration of Effect&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Typically shorter (2-4 hours)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Longer-lasting (up to 8 hours)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Odor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Often pleasant botanical scents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chemical smell that may be unpleasant&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why tiger mosquitoes pose a serious health threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) represents a significant public health concern in many regions worldwide. Originally native to Southeast Asia, this invasive species has spread to every continent except Antarctica. In Guadeloupe and increasingly in mainland France, these mosquitoes pose a growing threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes tiger mosquitoes particularly dangerous is their potential to transmit several serious diseases. &lt;em&gt;Their role as disease vectors makes them significantly more dangerous than mere nuisance insects&lt;/em&gt;. These mosquitoes can carry viruses that cause:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue fever – causing severe joint pain and potentially fatal complications&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chikungunya – resulting in debilitating joint pain that can last for months&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zika virus – particularly dangerous for pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellow fever – a serious hemorrhagic disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiger mosquitoes are also more challenging to detect than common mosquitoes. They are smaller, produce less buzzing noise, and their feeding behavior makes their presence less noticeable until after they’ve bitten. This stealthy nature increases exposure risk, similar to how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/babies-treated-with-antibiotics-respond-less-well-to-vaccines/"&gt;certain medical treatments can affect immune responses without immediate notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tiger mosquitoes are diurnal feeders, active during daylight hours when people are typically outdoors, unlike many mosquito species that feed primarily at dawn and dusk. This behavior pattern increases human exposure and the subsequent risk of disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Advancing natural protection strategies against mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful testing of Kreopik opens new possibilities for &lt;strong&gt;natural mosquito protection solutions&lt;/strong&gt; that don’t rely on synthetic chemicals. As climate change expands the range of mosquito-borne diseases, the need for effective, safe repellents grows increasingly urgent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors significantly influence mosquito populations and behavior. Research shows that the &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;relationship between environmental conditions and biological responses&lt;/a&gt; affects many aspects of public health, including insect-borne disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The development of natural repellents like Kreopik represents a holistic approach to mosquito control that addresses both human safety and environmental concerns. By utilizing sustainably sourced botanical ingredients, these solutions minimize ecological impact while providing effective protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional adaptation of natural repellent formulations offers particular advantages&lt;/em&gt;, as locally available plants often evolve natural defenses against native insect species. This localized approach potentially creates more effective protection specific to regional mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this research continues to advance, we may see more diverse natural options becoming available, giving consumers alternatives to chemical repellents while maintaining strong protection against these disease-carrying insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

But they only target one thing: the amyloid plaques. This approach targets all the major pathologies of concern in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in clinical trials, the implications could be profound. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00418-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00418-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; affects more than 55 million people globally; most have Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01102-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01102-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Anti-amyloid therapies&lt;/a&gt; on the market &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01726-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01726-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, but “they don’t stop it. They don’t restore function,” says co-author Bruce Yankner, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet have the penicillin for Alzheimer’s,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Old tonic, new role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, lithium was touted as a mood-altering health tonic, even appearing as an upper in an early recipe for 7-Up. It re-emerged in the 1970s as the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/425118a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/425118a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists soon noticed that among people with bipolar disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news040726-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/news040726-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;brain ageing was slower in those taking lithium than in those who weren’t&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, epidemiological studies revealed that regions in which water supplies contained trace amounts of lithium had relatively low dementia rates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But clinical trials to test lithium’s effects on cognitive decline had mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research to clarify lithium’s role, Yankner and his team showed, for the first time, that the metal is naturally present in the brain — where it has an important physiological role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues added up. The authors found that lithium levels were lower in parts of the human brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease than in unaffected regions. The team also discovered that in people with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s, brain lithium is tied up in amyloid plaques, leaving less available for essential brain functions. This lithium withdrawal “became more severe as the disease progressed”, says Yankner. Lithium met a similar fate in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02471-4/d41586-025-02471-4_51308716.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02471-4/d41586-025-02471-4_51308716.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="One pair of boxes shows fewer green amyloid clusters on the left and more on the right.

This kicked off a vicious cycle that might represent the devastating progression of Alzheimer’s disease: less lithium in the brain leads to more amyloid, which leads to even less lithium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner and his team linked lithium loss with other markers of the disease, including a build-up of tau protein tangles and altered activity of Alzheimer-related genes. They even identified a potential means to break the deleterious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most clinical trials of lithium have tested the form lithium carbonate. The team showed that amyloid plaques readily trap this form — but others, such as lithium orotate, avoid that fate. When the authors gave mice low doses of lithium orotate, it reversed disease-related brain damage and restored the animals’ memory. Lithium carbonate did not have the same benefits, potentially helping to explain the mixed results of earlier clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There were weightlifters and their murky shakes spiked with GNC powder, then the carb-shunning South Beach-ers of the early aughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2TSCO5LNABDHVO5BBVFSI4PQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But these days, it’s not just the protein-maxing, macro-counting gym bros espousing their lust for the stuff. At some point, protein became the shibboleth for the suddenly trendy menopausal and perimenopausal set, along with power-walking in weighted vests. The MAGA movement, which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/03/13/steak-shake-maga-beef-tallow/" target="_blank"&gt;touts beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; and red meat, is on board. Wellness influencers laud it for building strength and curbing appetites, while often overlooking the fact most of these products marketed as health foods qualify as the kind of ultra-processed fare we’re told to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DV4N4MIAIBDBTJZZ5QVVRVPKSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Acolytes are not just content to house chicken breasts and hard-boiled eggs and beef jerky. Everything, it seems, is getting protein-ified — even &lt;a href="https://store.orawellness.com/products/orawellness-smile-hydroxyapatite-toothpaste-paleo-cinnamony-mint?srsltid=AfmBOopbramT9xdIPxZkzJN71PRA5S94rJMRY3oYZBv6qchwbhP39Q-8" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, is case you want gums that are swole, not swollen. Never mind that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/01/02/how-much-protein-do-you-need/" target="_blank"&gt;most Americans are already eating the recommended amount of protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QJQSG5RGZHADE4PMD4ZWNXHQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much is enough? The federal recommended dietary allowance is 0.8 grams daily per kilogram of body weight, which is about 54 grams of protein for a person weighing 150 pounds. But that is the minimum. For active people, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;experts recommend between 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram&lt;/a&gt; and even up to double the daily minimum. For athletes, some researchers recommend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XQYSR6UEVANLB5CGGBLUAYT54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter, food companies eager to capitalize on the collective hunger for protein are packing it into just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCMRY6MCDBHRPGS4UMGCF4ADLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could, I noted to an editor, spend a day eat nothing but protein-boosted food, which is how I would end up with an assignment to do just that. (Perhaps this will teach me to keep such observations to myself.) With my mission set, I first went shopping, and found it easy to fill up a cart. The day was heavy on snacks since many of the popular products are designed for on-the-go eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RS3PRRTZ7RADZAF6TCYRJUBQZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In my account below, I’ve noted the protein contained in one serving of each item I tried, although I did not finish a full serving of each. I wanted to survive the full day, after all. Here’s how my day of eating like a fruit-fearing amino acid freak went down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U4IEWVGFBFG4LE2RXM3OGTQ23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wheaties Protein (29 g protein per serving: 21 g from the cereal; 8 g from ¾ cup whole milk)&lt;/b&gt;: I started off like a champion — with a bowl of Wheaties. The company has always associated itself with athletes, so its new protein-packed flavors seem quite on-brand. I tried the honey pecan variety, whose sweetener gave the traditional flakes a strange texture, rendering them sticky and not crunchy. The cloying fake vanilla flavor wasn’t doing them any favors either, although I appreciated that at least some of the cereal’s protein came not just from soy protein isolate but from pecans and sunflower seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGPTBBNZJBET3JDEXMS4TWDDQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legendary Foods Strawberry Protein Pastry (20 g protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; If you’re more of a Pop-Tart person, there’s a jacked-up breakfast for you — this sure looks like dupe for the nostalgic treat, with its confetti-flecked icing topping. A protein blend of calcium caseinate, micellar casein (both derived from dairy) and whey protein isolates were the first ingredients on a list that included a litany of unappealing lab-wizardry, from sugar substitutes erythritol and sucralose to Yellows No. 1 and 5. This Mock Tart tasted as fake as one might suspect, even after a warmup in the microwave that the wrapper promised would give me a “next level experience.” Honestly, I’d rather eat the grocery bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWRKXQ4U6VDFBBCYAGBGZPI44A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready Protein Water (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Of course there is such a thing as protein water, a product that caused me to ask a question I never expected to mull: Can water feel slimy? The answer, it turns out, is yes! This drink was viscous and flavored with cherry, giving it both the mouthfeel and taste of cough syrup. Alas, it lingered long after I had managed to gulp it down, leaving behind a tooth-coating stevia sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JAAMYIGC5CMRCHOHRVP72SPTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Khloud Protein Popcorn (7 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;My midmorning snack was the most high-profile of the lineup. The brand fronted by reality royalty Khloé Kardashian, promises “Good stuff zero fluff,” and after my last science experiment of a snack, the simple, easily pronounceable ingredients (popcorn, milk protein isolate, cane sugar, olive oil, coconut milk and mineral salt) were welcome. I would have preferred the white cheddar flavor, but my local market only had the sweet and salty kettle corn style in stock, so that’s what I went with. The kernels had a nice sweet-salt balance and no off flavors, but they felt a little stale, and the powdery dust covering them was chalky. Still, unlike nearly all of the other bites I tried on this fateful day, I actually went back for a second handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZBGFW3KARCGVFSO45W4ATFKCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barilla’s Protein+ pasta (10 g of protein per serving) and Chad &amp;amp; Barney’s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sturdy Sauce (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;For lunch, a bowl of pasta awaited — but not anything your nonna would recognize. The penne got some heft from pea protein and chickpea flour, and the marinara was bulked up with something called “hydrolyzed bovine collagen.” The pasta itself was passable, if a tad gummy. But the bitter, astringent sauce tasted like licking a can of sour tomatoes. I was halfway through the day and already ready to quit — protein is supposed to help you get stronger, but my will to finish this project was suddenly feeling quite feeble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YKI5R2WZ5A33GVNXPWQFRRL2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redefine Foods’ oatmeal protein pie (15 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Later in the afternoon, I sampled a trio of peanut-powered products. First up was a sandwich of soft chocolate disks and a filling made with what I assumed was Skippy brand peanut butter. But when I examined the packaging, I noticed that nowhere was the phrase “peanut butter” actually used, and that underneath the large font used to tout the “chocolate” was the smaller modifier “flavored.” As it turned out, there wasn’t much of the promised flavoring, and I’m not sure I would have known the pie was chocolate if I didn’t have the visual cue and the packaging to tell me. The filling itself was fine at first bite, but I quickly got that suspiciously cloying note — and another glance at the wrapper revealed the culprit: stevia, my nemesis of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWI2KDWCWNGXHPNWZTJ4VOZDD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers Flavored Protein Bar (18 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; Another giant of the peanut butter space, Reese’s, is half of the collab with protein-bar maker One. I sighed when I spotted yet more low-calorie sweeteners — this bar includes maltitol, a sugar alcohol; and isomalto-oligosaccharides, which are derived from starch — that gives this bar the feeling of a Franken-candy. It was chewy, gritty and brought to mind stale taffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPYT75G3RRFZBJCVFZVGPXSSCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Complete Cookie (8 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;This soft-baked cookie&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with peanut butter and chocolate chip earned the dubious distinction of being my least-loathed of the three, with a chewy texture and more natural flavor. But if you’re in the game for protein, this cookie might be a bit misleading: The packaging says it contains 16 grams, but an examination of the nutritional label clarifies that the single cookie comprises two servings, meaning each serving contains only 8 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3APAVLIUFCGPMNNVAOB74KGSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quest protein chips (19 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; A combo of crispy snacks awaited me later. I was excited (well, as jazzed as I could be after the day’s onslaught) by the Quest tortilla-style chips in the ranch flavor, which some fans have hyped on social media as a substitute for Cool Ranch Doritos, my guilty pleasure of a road-trip snack. They were, alas, a pale shadow of that classic chip, with a one-note tang and a texture I found oddly … sandy? And really, people — more stevia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4UTNMHYWCNB6PID6VYUZN3RHUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Fitzels (7 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; This snack, a play on “pretzels” and … “fitness,” probably, offered more potential for misunderstanding. The packaging notes that there are 20 grams of protein per bag, but again, you have to read the fine print to glean that there are three servings in the small pouch. The “cinnamon bun” flavor had a nice bakery-like scent, but they didn’t have the same snap as real pretzels (perhaps due to the addition of pea protein). Still, I felt like I was ending the day on a relatively high note, because I didn’t want to actually throw this snack across the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SIQCMIZB4ZEB3LJR3PXLF644WY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My day of protein-packed eating was, mercifully, over. I finished the marathon feeling a bit wiser (if more than a little nauseous): It seems that the world of protein-enhanced products is laden with so many highly processed ingredients. Shoppers should scour those ingredient labels carefully. And maybe not everything needs to be “health” food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEG4YGUP4NAPZNF2BAE4OR272E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I planned to skip dinner, probably.

All procedures complied with relevant ethical regulations. All post-mortem human brain and serum samples were fully deidentified before receipt, and no identifiable private donor information was accessible to the researchers. As such, informed consent was not applicable. Frozen post-mortem samples from the prefrontal cortex (BA9/10/47) were available for all cases included in the analysis. Cerebellar tissue and the most recently collected pre-mortem serum samples were available for a subset of individuals. The primary analysis was performed on tissue samples procured from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, derived from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (referred to as ROSMAP).

The follow-up rate exceeded 95% and the autopsy rate exceeded 90%. All individuals who underwent autopsy were subject to a uniform structured neuropathological evaluation of AD. Informed consent, an Anatomic Gift Act and a repository consent were obtained and the studies were approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. A second set of frozen frontal cortical brain samples was obtained from brain banks at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University, and is referred to as “a second independent cohort”. Brain tissue obtained from these sources had a confirmed pathological diagnosis of AD or NCI. Samples were randomly selected by the source institutions based on tissue availability and alignment with the requested diagnostic categories (NCI, MCI and AD). Within each diagnostic group, samples were matched for age and sex to ensure group comparability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolute and relative metal levels were measured by ICP–MS, with relative levels calculated as the ratio of cortical or cerebellar to serum concentrations from the same individual. Post-mortem interval had no significant effect on total or relative Li levels in this cohort. The study population comprised 40.2% male individuals and 59.8% female individuals. Within diagnostic subgroups, NCI cases comprised 40.8% male individuals and 59.2% female individuals; MCI cases, 42% male individuals and 58% female individuals; and AD cases, 36.4% male individuals and 63.6% female individuals. Individuals of both sexes were analysed, and those with MCI and AD, regardless of sex, exhibited significantly reduced cortical-to-serum Li ratios and lower total cortical Li levels. Donor sex was self-reported and provided by Rush Medical Center (ROSMAP study) and by further tissue sources, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Isolation of plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fractionate brain parenchymal homogenates into amyloid plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions, we modified a previously described protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Ihara, Y., Abraham, C. &amp;amp; Selkoe, D.

Frozen brain samples were weighed and then Dounce-homogenized (40 strokes per sample) in 5 volumes (v/w) of ultrapure buffer containing 2% SDS (stock of ultrapure SDS 10%, ThermoFisher Scientific, 24730020) and 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol (VWR, 97064-878) in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6 (ultrapure Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, Invitrogen, 15567-027) and water (Aristar Ultra, VWR 87003-236). The Li concentration of the complete buffer was below the detection threshold (&amp;lt;0.02 µg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The homogenates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and then transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube fitted with a sieve consisting of woven mesh (polyethylene terephthalate) with a pore size of 100 µm (pluriSelect, SKU 43-10100-60). The samples were passed through the sieve by gravity and the filtrate was then centrifuged (300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min). The supernatant (soluble non-plaque fraction) was removed and stored at −80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in water at a ratio of 5 ml per gram of pellet mass and stored at –80 °C (plaque-enriched fraction). To image subfractionated Aβ and phospho-tau (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), 10 μl of the freshly collected plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions was layered onto albumin-coated glass slides and allowed to dry overnight. They were then washed with ultrapure PBS (which we determined contained less than 25 parts per trillion (ppt) Li) and incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to pSer202-tau (clone CP13) overnight in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by labelling with secondary anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 594, or anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300 in blocking buffer). The slides were then washed three times in ultrapure PBS and mounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;ICP–MS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the analysis of metals in human and mouse biological samples, we modified previous protocols to optimize the detection of ultra-trace elements. We tested several protocols and found that the use of precleaned polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) vials fitted with perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) caps, the use of ultra-trace grade reagents (nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water), combined with an extended sample digestion and homogenization, and a highly sensitive ICP–MS instrument (PerkinElmer NexION 2000C), allowed the robust detection of ultra-trace metals in human and mouse samples. The commercial precleaned PVDF vials (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0712-C) and PFA caps (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0309-C) were further processed by fully immersing them in 10% trace-grade nitric acid (Fisher Chemical, A509-P212) for at least 48 h, followed by abundant rinsing with double-distilled and deionized water and drying in a chemical hood for 48 h. The chemical hood was thoroughly cleaned before the experiment and was used exclusively for ICP–MS for the entire duration of the experiment to prevent contamination. We also used a protocol allowing for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of human brain samples (approximately 80–120 mg frozen brain material per region per case). First, we determined that the dry-to-wet ratio was unchanged in AD versus NCI. This was established in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 45 NCI and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 45 AD frozen cortical samples (100–200 mg per sample) that were weighed and then dried to a constant weight (48 h in a dry oven at 60 °C). The dry-to-wet ratios were 0.127 ± 0.048 for NCI and 0.123 ± 0.034 for AD and were not statistically different (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.67), in agreement with previous work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Xu, J. et al. Evidence for widespread, severe brain copper deficiency in Alzheimer’s dementia.

The samples were fully digested after about 36 h. The serum, the brain non-plaque fractions and the aqueous solutions were digested in an equal volume of nitric acid (67%) for 48 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). After digestion with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide (30%; BDH Aristar Ultra, VWR, 87003-224) was added for 24 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). We added one volume of hydrogen peroxide (w/m, relative to starting wet mass) to digested brain tissues and 0.75 volumes (relative to starting sample volume) to digested serum, non-plaque fractions and aqueous solutions. The samples were then diluted using a 2% nitric solution in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Indium was added to each solution as an internal standard (50 parts per billion; ppb). For all ICP–MS runs, we also measured freshly made solutions of element standards (0, 10 ppt, 50 ppt, 100 ppt, 1 ppb, 10 ppb and 50 ppb) using a 30-element ICP standard (Aristar, VWR, 89800-580). Each run included &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10 digestion blanks as well as &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20–30 blank measurements to calculate the detection limits. The samples were injected into a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS instrument fitted with a cross-flow nebulizer and peristaltic pump for sample introduction. The sample delay time was 30 s with a pump speed of 24 rpm. A wash solution of 2% nitric was used between analyses of samples. The human cortex, cerebellum and serum samples were each measured twice on two consecutive days (two technical replicates per sample) and the average value was obtained for each sample. The correlation coefficients between the lithium concentrations measured on day 1 and day 2 were &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.99 for frontal cortex, cerebellum and serum, showing that the ICP–MS measurement was highly reproducible. After each run, ICP–MS signal processing was done using GeoPro 2010 Software (Cetac Technologies). We derived the standard curves for each element, calculated the concentration of each element in the diluted solution, and used the dilution factors to derive elemental abundance in the original samples. Li levels in the cortex and cerebellum are reported per unit of wet weight (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d,e&lt;/a&gt;, Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig6"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were calculated as follows: LOD = &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&lt;i&gt;tS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and LOQ = &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 10&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the average blank signal, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is the critical value of the one-tailed &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (one-tailed, 95% confidence interval; for example, for 27 blank samples, df = 26 and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 1.706) and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of a blank signal. LOD and LOQ values for all metals can be found in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. All individual Li measurements in human samples (prefrontal cortex, cerebellum and serum) were above the LOQ. In recovery experiments, wet brain samples or fluids were spiked with lithium standard added at three levels (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7 replicates per spiking level). The recovery of Li from spiked samples ranged from 91% to 105%. All human sample measurements were double-blinded: one lab member not involved in the study relabelled the samples and kept a file with the old and new codes. After the ICP–MS measurements, the samples were unblinded in the presence of the researchers involved in the study, as well as the lab member who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICP–MS findings from post-mortem human samples were replicated as follows. First, reduced Li content in the cortex of patients with AD was observed using two independent methods, after measurement of total Li levels in frozen cortical material of cases from both ROSMAP (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;) and other sources (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), as well as after fractionation and removal of amyloid plaques (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1g&lt;/a&gt;). Second, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) were also independently confirmed when &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 60 NCI and AD cases were processed and analysed by ICP–MS in a different laboratory (the Spectroscopy Core Facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln). Third, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) were also confirmed when &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48 NCI and AD cases were processed using an alternative protocol. Frozen samples were thawed and dried to a constant weight by incubating in a dry oven at 60 °C for 48 h. The dried tissue was then digested in 1 ml of 67% nitric acid using a heating block at 95 °C for 3 h. After digestion, 0.3 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added and the mixture was heated for a further 3 h. Finally, the samples were diluted and analysed using ICP–MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li levels measured in the PFC of ageing NCI cases (ROSMAP cases: mean 2.36 ± 1.23 ng per g, range 0.52–6.0 ng per g; non-ROSMAP cases: mean 3.50 ± 2.27 ng per g, range 0.89–9.94 ng per g; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d,e&lt;/a&gt;) were similar to those measured in a previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Ramos, P. et al.

Frozen human and mouse brains were first embedded in OCT medium and then sectioned using a cryostat, and the resulting sections (80 μm thick) were mounted onto glass slides. Before data acquisition, the samples were placed vertically in a rack and air-dried for 1 h. The LA-ICP–MS spectrometer consisted of a laser ablation system (213 nm Nd:YAG, Cetac Technologies) connected to a Perkin Elmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS (Perkin Elmer). Using the line tool, we manually selected the area to be ablated. For human samples, we ablated a region of the prefrontal cortex. For mouse samples, we processed coronal sections where the cortex and hippocampus were readily identifiable. The analyte signal was collected using multiple parallel line scans along the entire selected area, progressing in the direction of ablation cell gas flow, using a spot size of 200 µm at 75 µm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The laser operated at an energy level of 70% and a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz. The typical run time for one sample was about 4–5 h. We also ablated parts of each section that did include brain tissue but contained embedding medium (OCT) and subtracted this background signal from the total signal. Levels of &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li were normalized to carbon (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) to correct for any variations in the amount of tissue ablated. Similar conclusions were reached when the analysis did not include normalization to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. Matrix-matched standards were obtained by spiking homogenized samples of human or mouse tissue with three different concentrations of metal standard solution containing the analytes of interest. After homogenization, the mixtures were frozen and 80-μm sections were cut using the cryostat. The final concentrations of these standards were validated by ICP–MS. After LA-ICP–MS data acquisition, signal processing was done using Iolite Software 2018 (Iolite). A Li distribution matrix was generated computationally, using the multiple parallel line rasters. To identify the regions occupied by amyloid plaques, the section immediately adjacent to the section analysed by LA-ICP–MS was processed for Aβ immunofluorescence. In brief, the adjacent section was first fixed with 4% PFA for 2 h then washed three times with PBS. The section was then blocked for 1 h with 2% BSA, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The anti-Aβ primary antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243), diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer, was then added and the section was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the section was washed three times with PBS (in total, 30 min), and a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa 594 antibody (diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer) was added for 3 h. The section was finally washed three times with PBS (for 30 min) and mounted. We acquired multiple pictures of Aβ immunofluorescence spanning the entire section using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. The images were then stitched together and imported into Iolite, where the distribution of Aβ immunofluorescence was computationally superimposed on the LA-ICP–MS Li distribution matrix. For each human or mouse sample, we manually selected multiple regions containing Aβ plaques (plaque or ‘P regions’) as well as neighbouring regions devoid of plaques (non-plaque or ‘NP regions’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean Li levels in P and NP regions were determined, and after correcting for background and normalizing to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, the P:NP ratios were calculated. Three other isotopes were also assessed: &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn. All measurements in P and NP regions exceeded the LOQ, which was 0.82 ng per g for &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, 0.23 µg per g for &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, 0.44 µg per g for &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and 55.1 ng per g for &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn). As positive controls, &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn were all enriched in plaques relative to non-plaque regions in the AD brain, consistent with previous observations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Hutchinson, R.

The purity and Li content were verified by mass spectrometry and ICP–MS, respectively. Sources for other Li salts used in conductivity assays are provided in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM18"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li salts were dissolved in distilled, deionized drinking water and administered ad libitum to mice. The low Li dose corresponded to 4.3 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (equivalent to 0.03 mg (30  µg) of elemental Li per litre). The background Li concentration in the water was minimal (0.109 µg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Solutions of 4.3 µM LiO and 2.15 µM LiC were prepared to deliver equivalent amounts of elemental Li, accounting for the two Li atoms per molecule of LiC (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). A 4.3 µM sodium orotate (NaO) solution was also prepared to assess the effects of the orotate anion in the absence of Li. Two more Li doses were also tested: 43 µEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (delivered as 43 µM LiO) and 430 µEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (delivered as 430 µM LiO or 215 µM Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). To control for the orotate anion at the high dose, a 430 µM NaO solution was also tested. Average daily water consumption was comparable across all treatment groups and the vehicle (water-only) group. To evaluate Li uptake and its biological effects in the brain, mice received the Li-containing water for defined periods. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with control mice receiving plain drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Conductivity measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the conductivity of Li salts, the salts were dissolved in water to achieve Li concentrations of 4.3 mEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 430 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 43 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 21.5 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in each case. Conductivity was measured using an ST300C conductivity meter (OHAUS, 83033964) equipped with a STCON7 electrode (OHAUS, 30080693) calibrated with potassium chloride conductivity standards. For each lithium salt, three independent solution replicates (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3) were prepared. Conductivity values are reported in μS per cm at 25 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;In vitro binding of lithium to Aβ&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the in vitro binding of Li to Aβ, both oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ42 were prepared. Human Aβ1–42 peptide (1 mg) was initially dissolved in 80 μl of 1% NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH then diluted with PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (stock solution) and stored at −80 °C. Oligomeric Aβ42 was generated by resuspending the stock solution in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Fibrillar Aβ42 was obtained by incubating the same stock at 37 °C for 72 h. For Li binding assays, 10 µg of either oligomeric or fibrillar Aβ42 (10 µl of the 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; stock) was added to 90 µl of Li-containing solutions. These solutions included varying concentrations of either LiO or LiC, matched for Li content and dissolved in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Ultrapure water alone served as the negative control. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, the mixtures were transferred to dialysis membranes for 24 h to remove unbound Li (Pur-A-Lyzer mini dialysis kits were used: 6–8 kDa cut-off for oligomers and 25 kDa for fibrils). After dialysis, the samples were transferred into precleaned PVDF vials and digested by adding an equal volume of 67% nitric acid (final volume, 200 µl), followed by a 24-h digestion period. The digested samples were then diluted to 800 µl with 2% nitric acid prepared in ultrapure water. Li content was quantified using a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS instrument. Elemental Li standards were prepared and standard curves showed excellent linearity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.99). The bound &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li levels were calculated across a range of Li salt concentrations, and binding curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism (v.9.4.1). Binding affinities (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and 95% confidence intervals for LiO and LiC were determined using nonlinear regression analysis ([agonist] versus response–variable slope, four-parameter model; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM15"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). Binding to Aβ42 oligomers and fibrils was modelled across the full concentration range (0–500 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as within the higher-affinity subranges (0–50 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for oligomers and 0–30 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for fibrils; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM15"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal housing and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School. All mice were housed socially (2–4 animals per cage) in a room with a 12 h:12 h  light:dark cycle (lights on at 06:00), controlled for temperature (18–22 °C) and humidity (40–60%). Sentinel mice housed in each rack were tested quarterly and confirmed to be free of pathogens. All cages were individually ventilated. The standard diet 5053, as well as the chemically defined control and Li-deficient diets, were irradiated. Reverse osmosis deionized water and deionized water containing LiO, LiC or NaO was provided ad libitum in bottles that were changed at least weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type mice were on a C57BL/6J background.

For breeding, 10–20 females (all litter-mates derived from the same cross) were typically mated with 8–12 males (all litter-mates derived from the same cross). Mice were identified by numbered ear tags and were randomly selected for behavioural and histological analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess treatment effects on disease onset and progression, animals were treated either before pathology emerged (5–6 months old for 3xTg; 3 months old for J20) or after pathology was established (starting at 9 months old for 3xTg and 17 months old for J20). To investigate age-related effects in wild-type mice, chronic treatments were initiated in adulthood (10–12 months old) and continued for 10–14 months during ageing. Experiments included both sexes, and results were consistent between males and females. The number and sex of animals used in each experimental group can be found in the Source Data file. Investigators remained blinded to genotypes and treatment conditions throughout data collection and analysis. No prior sample-size calculations were done, but the number of animals used was consistent with similar studies in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Mouse diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li levels in the cortex were comparable between human NCI cases (RUSH cohort: range 0.52–6.0 ng per g; non-RUSH cohort: range 0.89–9.94 ng per g) and mice (wild type and J20: range 1.61–4.59 ng per g). Similarly, serum Li levels in human NCI cases (range 1.53–10.41 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) overlapped with those in mice (wild type, J20, 3xTg: range 0.75–4.50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), supporting the relevance of mouse models for studying the biological effects of lithium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regular mouse 5053 is a grain-based diet that does not allow Li levels to be manipulated experimentally. To obtain a Li-deficient diet, we used a standard, chemically defined mouse AIN-93M diet that is calorically and nutritionally equivalent to the 5053 diet and was formulated as a standard diet for laboratory rodents by the American Institute of Nutrition in 1993. We tested 5 samples of the regular mouse 5053 diet and 5 samples of the AIN-93M diet and found that the average Li content was 104.8 ng per g in the 5053 diet and 103 ng per g in the AIN-93M diet. The AIN-93M chemically defined diet was modified to exclude Li. The Li-deficient and control AIN-93M diets were formulated by Dyets. We measured Li levels in the Li-deficient diet and confirmed that Li was depleted by 92.0% relative to the chemically defined control diet. The abundances of the other 26 metals that we measured by ICP–MS were identical (data not shown). The solid diets were irradiated before administration to animals. The diets were stored in closed plastic bags that were placed inside cardboard boxes (devoid of light) at −20 °C for up to 4 months before administration to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;DNA extraction and genotyping by PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collected about 0.5–1.0 cm of mouse tails in clean Eppendorf tubes; 500 μl of tail lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) containing 0.4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Proteinase K was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight in a 56 °C water bath. The next day, 500 μl of isopropanol was added to precipitate the DNA, and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 20 s. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and the isopropanol was carefully removed, avoiding the DNA pellet. We then added 70% ethanol and shook the tubes to wash the DNA pellet. We next centrifuged the tubes for 10 min at 18,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. We removed the ethanol and air-dried the DNA pellet for 2–16 h. The DNA was resuspended in 100 μl acetate-EDTA buffer and placed in a 56 °C water bath overnight. To amplify DNA regions by PCR, we mixed 3 μl of DNA sample with corresponding amounts of forward and reverse PCR primers, PCR master mix and nuclease-free water, and ran the reactions in a thermocycler. Sample loading dye was added to the PCR products and the samples were run on 1–3% agarose gels (prepared by dissolving agarose in TAE buffer, to which Gel Red was added to allow DNA visualization). We also loaded a 100-bp DNA ladder. Gels were visualized using a UV transilluminator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Quantitative RT–PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination.

A stock solution of CHIR-99021 was prepared in DMSO and diluted in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, containing 2% DMSO. The solution was warmed to 70 °C to ensure dissolution of the compound. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of CHIR99021 at a dose of 50 mg per kg body weight, once daily for 14 consecutive days. Control animals received equivalent volumes of vehicle (2% DMSO in saline). All animals tolerated the treatment without visible abnormalities and were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Blood chemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUN and creatinine measurements were done by IDEXX Laboratories, using mouse serum samples.

Each mouse was recorded for 10 min, and the average speed and distance travelled were automatically recorded. Mice had no prior exposure to the open-field arena (spontaneous test). All behavioural experiments were performed by researchers who were blinded to the experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess spatial learning and memory, we trained and tested mice in a large circular pool (1.1 m in diameter) filled with 21 °C water, which was rendered opaque by the addition of non-toxic white paint. We placed four distinct visual cues (representing different geometric shapes, patterns and colours) on each wall, to facilitate spatial orientation and the acquisition of spatial memory. Mice were given four training trials a day for 5–7 consecutive days. Each training trial lasted for 1 min. Mice were trained to remember the location of a hidden platform that was submerged 2.5 cm below the water surface. The location of the hidden platform (south-east) remained the same during the 5–7-day training period. If, after a 60-second trial, the animal failed to locate the platform, it was placed on the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Mice were trained four times a day and entered the pool in a randomized order of rotating entrance points (compass directions N, S, E, W, NE and SW). During each training trial, the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded. Then, 24 h after the last training trial, a probe trial was conducted. The platform was removed and mice entered the arena from the NW location (opposite from the platform). The number of entries in the target area (representing the area where the platform had been located during the training trials), the total time spent in the target area, as well as the time spent in all quadrants, and the swimming speed were recorded during the 60-s probe trial. We also conducted separate trials in which a visible platform (platform elevated above the water level, on which a small red flag had been placed) was presented. Mice were given several training sessions and the time (latency) to reach the visible platform was recorded. Mouse movements, as well as average speed, distance travelled, latency to reach a quadrant or target area and number of entries in the target area, were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) and the different measures were automatically recorded. For measurements of learning (latency to reach the platform during the training trials), mice underwent repeated measurements (four measurements a day for 6–7 consecutive days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Novel-object recognition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in the same open-field box with two novel identical objects for 10 min and allowed to freely explore the identical objects. The next day, mice were reintroduced in the open-field box and presented with a novel object, as well as one of the two objects they explored the previous day. The mice were allowed to explore the objects for 10 min and their movements were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) coupled to a camera. The box and items were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mice. We automatically recorded the time each mouse spent exploring each object, on both day 1 (two identical objects) or day 2 (one novel object and one familiar object), and derived a novelty (discrimination) index, defined as the ratio of time spent exploring the novel object relative to the familiar one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Y maze&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous alternation, which is a measure of spatial working memory, was assessed by allowing the mice to freely explore a Y-shaped maze for 8 min. The Y maze consisted of 3 arms (each 40 cm × 8 cm x 15 cm) at an angle of 120° from each other. Mice typically preferred to investigate a new arm of the maze, rather than returning to one that was previously visited. Using TopScanLite software, we recorded each entry in one of the three arms (A, B and C) and then derived the percentage of total correct alternations over the 8-min duration of the trial. A correct alternation (triad) is a succession of entries into three different arms (A–B–C, A–C–B, B–A–C, B–C–A, C–A–B or C–B–A).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Mouse neuropathology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and carbon dioxide and then perfused with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. Brains were rapidly removed and the two hemispheres were separated. One hemisphere was dissected into subregions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum). Each subregion was placed in a separate Eppendorf tube, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a freezer at −80 °C. The second hemisphere was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h. The fixed brain was then processed for paraffin embedding, using standard procedures. Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned and 6-μm sections were mounted on glass slides and used for histological analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded mouse brain blocks were sectioned and the sections were mounted on glass slides. We deparaffinized the sections by immersion in two xylene baths for a total of 10 min, followed by a 5-min immersion in a 50% xylene:50% ethanol solution. The sections were then rehydrated by immersion in solutions of decreasing concentrations of ethanol (95%, 90%, 70% and 50%) and then placed in water. Sections then underwent antigen retrieval using the Diva decloaker (BioCare). Sections were blocked with 3% BSA, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM18"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; has a list of antibodies used for immunolabelling) were diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, sections were washed three times with PBS. Secondary antibodies, diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS were either biotin-coupled (1:200; Vector Labs) or coupled to Alexa fluorophores (1:300, Invitrogen). After three 10-min washes with PBS, sections were mounted with Pro-Long anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen) and then imaged using confocal microscopy. For the Aβ labelling shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig6"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;, we incubated sections with an anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (VectorLabs) for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS (1 min each) and the addition of avidin-streptavidin-HRP-coupled complex (1:200 in 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS; VectorLabs). After three washes with PBS, we added diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (prepared by dissolving DAB and peroxide tablets in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for several minutes, until a brown precipitate formed. Sections were then washed with PBS, dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and 100%), followed by incubation with a 50% ethanol:50% xylene solution and two immersions in 100% xylene (5 min each). Sections were mounted with a hydrophobic mounting medium (Permount). For Thioflavin S staining, after deparaffinization the brains were incubated with filtered 1% aqueous Thioflavin-S for 8 min at room temperature, then washed twice (3 min each) in 80% ethanol, once in 95% ethanol (3 min), three times in distilled water and finally mounted. For sections labelled by immunofluorescence, multiple confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope FV3000. For DAB-stained sections, we acquired pictures using a bright-field microscope coupled with a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of the Aβ plaque burden, pictures of Aβ immunoreactivity (using the rabbit anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, clone D54D2, Cell Signaling, 8243, dilution 1:250) in the hippocampus were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. For each picture, the background was subtracted (rolling ball radius was set for 25). Pictures then underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 120. Particles with a minimal size of 5 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were retained and their number, average size and mean fluorescence intensity were automatically recorded for each picture in an Excel file. To calculate the Aβ plaque burden, the total area occupied by Aβ plaques was divided by the area of the selection. Three coronal sections (6 μm thick) were sampled for each animal, in the rostral, intermediate and ventral hippocampus. Two 20× images were acquired per section, using an Olympus FluoView LV1000 confocal microscope. The average Aβ burden was obtained by averaging the Aβ plaque density (area occupied by Aβ plaques divided by the total area analysed) in all pictures acquired for each animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of tau pathology, pictures of p-Ser202 tau (CP13, dilution 1:150) or p-Ser396/Ser404 tau (PHF1, dilution 1:200) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA1 were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. Pictures underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 150. The number of tau-positive neurons in the selected CA1 area was then manually counted for each thresholded picture and the area was measured. For each picture, we calculated the average density of tau-positive neurons (the total number of tau-positive neurons divided by the area of the region). The average tau-positive neuron densities were calculated for each animal by averaging all the pictures acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent image analysis was also performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). Mean fluorescence intensity for specific markers was quantified in each animal either in the nucleus (β-catenin) or across the entire cell body (for example, GSK3β, pSer9-GSK3β, pTyr216-GSK3β, GPNMB and LPL), based on co-labelling with cell-type-specific markers (such as MAP2, aspartoacylase and Iba1). Between 50 and 300 cells per mouse were analysed, and background signal was subtracted. Synaptophysin and PSD-95 fluorescence intensities were quantified in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and FluoroMyelin, MBP and SMI-312 intensities were measured in the corpus callosum, with background subtraction applied in all cases. Cell densities of Iba1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, aspartoacylase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PDGFRα&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations were also determined in relevant brain regions by quantifying 50–500 cells per mouse. For each measurement, multiple images were acquired at 4×, 10×, 20× or 40× magnification per animal, spanning the region of interest. Values were averaged for each animal before statistical analysis. The following primary antibodies were also used: anti-aspartoacylase [N1C3-2] (GeneTex, GTX113389; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-aspartoacylase (clone D-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-377308, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:50), anti-β-catenin (clone E247; Abcam, ab32572; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-β-catenin (clone 1B8A1; PTGlab, 66379-1-Ig, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-CD68 (clone KP1; Abcam, ab955; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, G9269; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GSK3β (clone 3D10; Novus Bio, NBP1-47470SS; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-pTyr216-GSK3β (Millipore Sigma, SAB4300237; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-pSer9-GSK3β (Abcam, ab131097; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-Iba1 (clone EPR16588; Abcam ab178846; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:2,000), anti-PSD-95 (clone K28/43; Biolegend, 810401; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-synaptophysin (clone SY38; Millipore Sigma, mouse monoclonal, MAB5258-I; dilution 1:200), anti-neurofilament marker (pan axonal marker; clone SMI-312; Biolegend, 837904; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GPNMB (clone 2B10B8; PTGlab, 66926-1-Ig; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-LPL (Novus Bio, AF7197-SP; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-MAP2 (Phosphosolutions, 1099-MAP2; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:500), anti-MBP (clone D8X4Q; Cell Signaling, 78896; rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:200) and anti-PDGFRα (R&amp;amp;D Systems, AF1062; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200). Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:300 dilution: donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, A-11058), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A21206"&gt;A21206&lt;/a&gt;), donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A21203"&gt;A21203&lt;/a&gt;), donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31571), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31573) and donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, A-11055).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Golgi labelling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains were processed and stained using the FD Rapid Golgistain Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, PK401) following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. Immediately after dissection, the brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. After cryosectioning, free-floating sections of 100 μm were shortly (10 min) fixed in 4% PFA, then stained using the kit’s reagents and mounted using a glycerin-containing medium. Then 12 dendrites per mouse were imaged in the hippocampus or the cortex using a confocal microscope. Dendritic spine density was quantified using Fiji software v.2.9.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Transmission electron microscopy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3xTg mice were fed either a Li-deficient diet (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8) or a control diet (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8) from 6 to 12 months of age. At the end point, mice were perfused with a fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15949). After perfusion, 1–2-mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; brain sections were generated and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in fresh fixative. The corpus callosum was subsequently dissected and processed for embedding in TAAB Epon resin at the Harvard Electron Microscopy Core Facility. In brief, tissue was washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h, rinsed in distilled water and incubated in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. After two further water rinses, samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 90% and twice in 100%, for 10 min each) followed by 1 h in propylene oxide. Samples were then infiltrated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and TAAB Epon (Marivac), embedded in pure TAAB Epon the next day and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (approximately 80 nm thick) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, mounted on copper grids, stained with lead citrate and imaged using either a JEOL 1200EX or a Tecnai G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope. Images were captured using an AMT 2k CCD camera and saved in TIFF format. Quantification of myelin sheath thickness, axon diameter and g-ratio was performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 software (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). A total of 1,376 axons (control group) and 1,396 axons (Li-deficient group) were analysed from eight randomly selected fields per animal (×4,800 magnification) spanning the corpus callosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Aβ detection by ELISA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse endogenous Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40 and Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42 levels were measured using a previously established protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Teich, A.

In brief, hippocampi or cortices were homogenized in 20 volumes (v/w) of tissue lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 250 mM sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and 100 μM AEBSF. Soluble Aβ species were extracted from tissue homogenates by diethanolamine treatment. Mouse Aβ(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40) and Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42 were quantified using Wako ELISA kits (292-64501 and 294-62501, respectively). The LOQs were 7.44 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40) and 4.75 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42. Sample concentrations ranged from 26.21 to 52.98 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40) and from 11.72 to 22.40 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42, all above the respective LOQs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Assessment of microglial function in vitro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Microglial purification for cell-culture assays&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type Li-deficient and control mice were transcardially perfused with 1× cold PBS. The cortex and hippocampus were dissected and minced using a scalpel before transferring them to 5 ml digestion buffer (2 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of Dispase II, 20 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I, 10 μM HEPES in HBSS without calcium or magnesium). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by successive trituration with a Pasteur pipette followed by a 1 ml pipette. An equal volume of 1× HBSS was added to the homogenate and the resulting mix was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer, then centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended with 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02) to remove myelin, and microglia were enriched using CD11b beads, as described above. Microglia were resuspended in pre-warmed media (DMEM/F12 with 2% FBS, 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-34, 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; TGFβ1, 25 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; M-CSF) and counted using a haemocytometer. Microglia were seeded into 96-well glass-bottom plates precoated with poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine (Sigma, P4957) at 5,000 cells per well using 100 μl of medium. A half-medium change was performed on day 2 and the downstream assay was done on day 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary microglia were also purified using an alternative protocol. After perfusion, the cortex and hippocampus were dissected, placed in 3 ml buffer (0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and minced with small scissors for 4 min. Then, 7 ml Dispase buffer (2 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Dispase II in 0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was added and the tissue was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by gently triturating with a 10 ml pipette with a wide bore, to prevent cell shearing. The enzyme activity was halted by the 1:1 addition of 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (10 ml) at 4 °C. The homogenate was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer to remove meninges and clumped cells. The homogenate was then spun for 10 min at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 75% isotonic percoll in PBS (high percoll; GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02). Then 5 ml of 35% isotonic percoll in PBS (low percoll) was added, followed by 4 ml of PBS. The resulting discontinuous gradient was allowed to settle for 15 min at 4 °C. We then centrifuged the tubes at 800&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 45 min at 4 °C. We then aspirated the top (PBS-containing) layer and part of the upper percoll layer. The band containing microglia (approximately 1.5 ml), situated at the interface between the 35% percoll and 75% percoll layers, was gently collected. Then 50 ml of PBS was gently added and the tube was inverted 20 times. The microglia were then centrifuged at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in a pre-warmed (at 37 °C) buffer containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 50 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin in RPMI medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BV2 microglial cell line has been maintained in the Yankner laboratory for more than 20 years and stored long-term in liquid nitrogen at –180 °C. After revival, the BV2 cells were authenticated based on their characteristic microglial morphology (small, round to slightly elongated shape, clear cytoplasm and occasional short processes) as well as positive immunolabelling for the microglial markers CD11b and Iba1.

Next, 1 mg of Aβ1–42 peptide was dissolved in 80 μl 1% NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH, followed by dilution with PBS to 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (stock) and storage at −80 °C. Oligomeric Aβ1–42 was prepared by resuspending the stock solution in DMEM/F12 to 500 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (100 μM) and overnight incubation at 4 °C. On day 3, the medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS and Aβ42 oligomers diluted to a final concentration of 2 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4 µM). To assess Aβ42 uptake, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by three washes with 1× PBS and fixation with 4% PFA for 15 min. To assess microglial Aβ42 degradation, cells incubated with Aβ42 oligomers for 3 h were first washed three times with warm medium. The cells were then incubated with warm medium devoid of Aβ42 for an extra 3 h. They were then washed with 1× PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA, 2% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Anti-Iba1 and anti-Aβ (6E10) antibodies, diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer, were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cells were washed three times with PBS 1× and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:300 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS, then mounted and analysed by confocal microscopy. We also assessed Aβ42 uptake and clearance by microglia using fluorescently labelled (HiLyte Fluor 555) human Aβ1–42 (AnaSpec, AS-60480). The fluorescently labelled Aβ42 was directly added to the medium containing 2% FBS to reach a concentration of 2 ng µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the uptake and degradation assays were conducted as detailed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Microglial stimulation and treatment with GSK3β inhibitors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess cytokine release, primary microglia isolated from control and Li-deficient mice were treated with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; LPS on day 2 for 16 h followed by supernatant collection. Inflammatory cytokines were detected and measured using a mouse cytokine array kit (R&amp;amp;D Systems, ARY006).

Hippocampal tissue was dissected on ice and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both frozen hippocampal tissues were subsequently thawed together in 500 µl HB buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM spermine and 0.5 mM spermidine) and homogenized with the tight pestle of a dounce homogenizer in the same HB buffer with the addition of 0.32% of IGEPAL (Sigma) (average of 25–30 times per sample) on ice. Subsequently, single nuclei were diluted to 9 ml in HB buffer, passed through a 40-μm filter and separated from debris and multinuclei by iodixanol gradient centrifugation. Specifically, we prepared a 50% iodixanol solution by diluting 60% iodixanol (Optiprep density gradient medium, Sigma D1556) with diluent (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 120 mM Tricine-KOH, pH7.8), and subsequently diluted them with HB buffer and supplemented with 0.04% BSA and 64 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, N2611) to prepare 40% iodixanol and 30% iodixanol. We layered 1 ml of 40% iodixanol in the bottom, 1 ml of 30% iodixanol in the middle and gently layered 9 ml of the diluted nuclei suspension on top of the 30% iodixanol layer. The three layers were visually confirmed to be distinct and were subjected to 18 min of 10,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; centrifugation. Single nuclei were carefully recovered from the 30% iodixanol layer in between the 30% and 40% interface. An aliquot was taken for trypan blue staining and visual inspection of nucleic morphology under a microscope, which showed a homogeneous size distribution and absence of major debris or doublets. The numbers of nuclei were determined initially by haemocytometer and subsequently confirmed with an automated counter. The remainder of the nucleic suspension was diluted for nuclei encapsulation and sequencing library preparation at the Harvard Single Cell Core, according to the 10X Genomics manual.

The cortex and hippocampus were quickly dissected and pooled, then minced using a scalpel, before transferring to 5 ml dissection buffer (HBSS without calcium and magnesium) and Protector RNase inhibitor (Sigma) at 4 °C in a dounce homogenizer. Brain samples were dounced 20 times with a loose pestle and 10 times with a tight pestle. The cell suspension was passed through a pre-wetted 70-μm cell strainer into a pre-chilled 15 ml tube. Cells were then spun down at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml ice-cold 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 800&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Myelin debris was removed by vacuum suction and the cell pellet was washed with 5 ml ice-cold HBSS and spun again for 5 min at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 180 μl ice-cold MACs buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, Protector RNase inhibitor in PBS) with 20 μl of CD11b microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-049-601) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After incubation, 1 ml of MACs buffer was added to samples and cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C. Microglia were then isolated using LS columns with QuadroMACS Separator following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, LS columns were pre-washed three times with 3 ml MACs buffer. Samples were resuspended in 500 µl MACs buffer and transferred to LS columns, followed by three more washes with 3 ml MACs buffer. Finally, microglia were released with 5 ml MACs buffer (without EDTA), then used for RNA extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec44"&gt;Microglial RNA sequencing quality control and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total microglial RNA was extracted from MACs-purified microglia using RNAzol RT (Sigma, R4533). RNA extracted from each microglial preparation was quantified using an Agilent Tapestation 4200 instrument, with a corresponding Agilent Tapestation High Sensitivity RNA assay (5067-5579). The samples were normalized to 4 ng of input in 9.5 μl, and the polyadenylated mRNA was selected for using 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A as part of the Takara SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA (634894) workflow, which generated cDNA. From there, an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay (5067-4626) was used to quantify the cDNA concentration. Libraries were obtained using the Illumina NexteraXT kit (FC-131-1096). Adapter ligation, indexing and amplification were done subsequently as part of the same workflow. After amplification, residual primers were eluted away using KAPA Pure Beads (07983298001) in a 0.6× SPRI-based clean-up. The resulting purified libraries were run on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation instrument, with a corresponding Agilent D5000 ScreenTape assay (5067-5588 and 5067-5589) to visualize the libraries and check the size and concentration of each library. Molarity values obtained from this assay were used to normalize all samples in equimolar ratio for one final pool. The pooled library was denatured and loaded onto a single lane of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. The pool was loaded at 200 pM (normalized to 1 nM pre-denaturation), with 1% PhiX spiked in as a sequencing control. The base-call files were demultiplexed through the Harvard BPF Genomics Core pipeline and the resulting fastq files were used in subsequent analysis. Raw RNA-sequencing data in FASTQ format were subjected to quality assessment using FastQC (v.0.11.9) and sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome (mm10) using a STAR aligner&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Dobin, A. et al.

Genes were deemed expressed if at least &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9 samples (where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the group size) had more than one count per million (CPM). Genes not satisfying these criteria were removed, keeping the original library sizes. This filtering retained &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14,862 expressed genes out of 55,536 annotated genes for subsequent analyses. Counts were then normalized using the TMM method in edgeR. Finally, log(CPM) values were calculated for analyses other than differential expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To adjust gene expression for covariates, we fit the linear regression model for each gene and cohort separately using lm() in R: gene expression ~ group + covariates, where gene expression is log(CPM), and using the group and covariates: factor, two levels: LiO and water (reference level), covariates (sequencing batch (factor, two levels)) and one RUV with residuals (RUVr) covariate (continuous). The final normalized and adjusted gene-expression values were derived from adding the regression residuals to the estimated effect of the group level to preserve the effect of the group on expression. These normalized and adjusted gene-expression values were used to perform gene–gene regression analysis and gene–gene group regression analysis, and to visualize gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To adjust for technical variation, we used the RUVr method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Risso, D., Ngai, J., Speed, T.

The specified number of unwanted factors (RUVr covariates) used in final analyses were then estimated by the RUVr function using log(CPM) expression values and the residuals.

Hippocampal homogenates from Li-deficient and control 3xTg mice containing an equal amount (100 µg) of protein were reduced with 200 mM tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) at 55 °C for 1 h, then alkylated with 375 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Proteins were precipitated using the methanol/chloroform/water precipitation method and then digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. TMT labelling of digested samples was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). In brief, TMT labelling reagents were dissolved with 41 µl anhydrous acetonitrile, and an equal volume of TMT reagent mix was added to each sample. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 8 µl of 5% hydroxylamine. Equal amounts of peptides from each sample were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. The peptides were then separated using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system with a PolyWAX LP column (PolyLC), 200 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm and 300 A running under electrostatic repulsion–hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) mode conditions. Peptides were separated across a 90-minute gradient from 0% buffer A (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid) to 75% buffer B (30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with 20 fractions collected by time. Each fraction was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid solution before analysis by mass spectrometry. Each ERLIC fraction was submitted for a single liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiment that was done on a Q Exactive HF-X High Resolution Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC (Thermo Fisher) at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry. Peptides were first isolated on a trapping cartridge (300 µm × 5 mm PepMap Neo C18 trap cartridge, Thermo Scientific) before separation on an analytical column (µPAC, C18 pillar surface, 50-cm bed, Thermo Scientific). The LC gradient was as follows: 2–27% in mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 70 min and increased to 98% mobile phase B for 15 min at a flow rate of 300 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent mode for all analyses. Electrospray-positive ionization was enabled with a voltage of 2.1 kV. A full scan ranging from 400 to 1,600 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was done with a mass resolution of 12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and an automated gain control (AGC) target set to 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Proteomics quality control&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top three most intensive precursor ions from each scan were used for MS2 fragmentation (normalized collision energy of 32) at a mass resolution of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and an AGC of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The dynamic exclusion was set at 50 s with a precursor isolation window of 1.2 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. Raw data were submitted for analysis in Proteome Discoverer 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific). The MS/MS data were searched against the UniProt reviewed &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; (mouse) database along with known contaminants, such as human keratins and common lab contaminants. Sequest HT searches were performed using the following guidelines: a 10-ppm MS tolerance and 0.02-Da MS/MS tolerance; trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) on cysteine, TMT 6-plex tags on peptide amino termini and lysine residue (+229.163 Da) were set as static modification; oxidation (+15.995 Da) of methionine was set as variable modification; minimum required peptide length was set to ≥6 amino acids. At least one unique peptide per protein group was required to identify proteins. Of 13,404 proteins identified, only &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3,392 proteins were identified with high confidence (MS2 spectra assignment, FDR &amp;lt; 0.01 on both protein and peptide level by applying the target-decoy database search by Percolator) and were included in the statistical analysis, as per the standard procedures of the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Elias, J.

Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that hematopoietic stem cells are not required to repopulate the myeloid compartment of the brain environment. In contrast, Sca1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning. Our results overcome current limitations of conventional HCT and may pave the way for the development of allogeneic microglial cell therapies for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:26:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE9wbG9rZ1ViUGJ6bVV5Q1pjTlZUVkpRVDB3RmtOWEF2N2h5SGFOelNNSjBrelpzUE9qLTBIMGYwQ3pPbE8teFhRekd4cGR5N3VpU3ZTSFZpNFZaeFNzZVlJ</guid></item><item><title>在价值100万美元的Martha's Vineyard家附近散步后，新生儿左脑被“病毒”损坏...现在当地人担心它正在蔓延-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNbEo1VmRZWkJTNWp6a3ZvcDdFVFdEZFBobm9LLXlWeHd4TFZLWjZaZ1dHaFlFY29jQU1ZaXFRSnNvSlRzeGZOQ2laVnBxTURyYmVTenYxNzFveldKczJZLWRDbWpqTXRfV1hfZUxOSGhUUUh4Y2diWFRmc2hyNm5mWVhycmlZZUpvejNRdlZIbWdQZ2lLaEN5WUFZTTJVVjdLb0xZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE15X3BCVlAxLTZNdFdaeXVSYXpLNHV1M0o3d29KVnJHNHZOZnpQamZPa1pwWWwzOVhKeWVqZW9TeldmU21yS3ZsQXEtRVlIWW9sMmNmeTlEejJjdVdOR1ltQzJTaG9uNlFqaGVmSFJ2d1ZkZXh0cVgxODdnZDBqeTNoRThMOWlaUkZ4US1tSlVJY0xadkk0azRZWnlocTF5bkkxejJrT2Zhbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A newborn baby has been left with brain damage after being infected with a rare virus while on a family walk in Martha's Vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The one-month-old baby, Lily Belle Sisco, was flown to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-85c37310-72d3-11f0-9a51-331dfd50147f"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital on July 24 with a persistent 102-degree fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lily later started having seizures and was determined to have viral encephalitis.

'While she has the best medical team in Boston her parents haven’t left her side,' she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that Rose, Lily's big sister, is being cared for on Martha's Vineyard by family while her parents are with their newborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Marcus is the sole provider for their family,' the GoFundMe says. 'He has been by Lily’s side every moment in this journey.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far the fundraising page has raised over $27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sisco family said Lily is the youngest person to contract Powassan in the world. They are hoping to get their story out so a case like their daughter’s is never repeated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powassan virus is a rare but serious virus spread through the bite of infected ticks that has become more common in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, amidst one of the worst tick seasons in New England in a long time, cases are on the rise - and the disease is unpreventable &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;untreatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus can be spread within just 15 minutes of the tick's bite, and early symptoms can include fever, headache and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Marcus is the sole provider for their family,' a GoFundMe for Lily says. 'He has been by Lily’s side every moment in this journey' (Pictured: Marcus and Lily)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rose, Lily's big sister, is being cared for on Martha's Vineyard by family while her parents are with their newborn, according to the GoFundMe (pictured: Rose with Lily)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Sisco family said Lily is the youngest person to contract Powassan in the world.

This year alone Massachusetts has seen three confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases of the virus arise in the Northeast and Great Lakes region of Massachusetts from late spring through mid-fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is carried by nymph and adult deer ticks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,' Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who has conducted research on Martha's Vineyard, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His lab tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024 and found that between one and two percent of deer ticks were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:20:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNbEo1VmRZWkJTNWp6a3ZvcDdFVFdEZFBobm9LLXlWeHd4TFZLWjZaZ1dHaFlFY29jQU1ZaXFRSnNvSlRzeGZOQ2laVnBxTURyYmVTenYxNzFveldKczJZLWRDbWpqTXRfV1hfZUxOSGhUUUh4Y2diWFRmc2hyNm5mWVhycmlZZUpvejNRdlZIbWdQZ2lLaEN5WUFZTTJVVjdLb0xZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE15X3BCVlAxLTZNdFdaeXVSYXpLNHV1M0o3d29KVnJHNHZOZnpQamZPa1pwWWwzOVhKeWVqZW9TeldmU21yS3ZsQXEtRVlIWW9sMmNmeTlEejJjdVdOR1ltQzJTaG9uNlFqaGVmSFJ2d1ZkZXh0cVgxODdnZDBqeTNoRThMOWlaUkZ4US1tSlVJY0xadkk0azRZWnlocTF5bkkxejJrT2Zhbg</guid></item><item><title>牙医知道你讨厌使用牙线。试试这个。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBEakFKQWhWLVh5dEg0ZUFfUGFlTFNKQjRFY1B1YTBYTDFMdkdWWU9kWGMzOUxYVGtjRUdRWTR4d3h6RUR6OTZzdVJRVExJb0U5a3RmQklpRlhxT0VzdDZxY25sUjNDaDJubHQ4Y3lmMVpJSzVqa1A1QVBnbFJoQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBEakFKQWhWLVh5dEg0ZUFfUGFlTFNKQjRFY1B1YTBYTDFMdkdWWU9kWGMzOUxYVGtjRUdRWTR4d3h6RUR6OTZzdVJRVExJb0U5a3RmQklpRlhxT0VzdDZxY25sUjNDaDJubHQ4Y3lmMVpJSzVqa1A1QVBnbFJoQQ</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现飓风桑迪的隐藏死亡人数- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQMGNLSVc3RlBLdEhmU1k1eDF2VDUxd0lIaUNPZ3JqUmlDRDgxeTJlejZvZF9vZzVJMDNYNEpkYUFqbm5KSEZjV1c4X1ZQcDRYVUFwY3loM3M0cERfbFNpX0tZczJ2QWp4N0pjUlgtNWdEZmxpeWJ4SlpaRHVfckRjcENMX3NvSmdQemNWc3hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;More than a decade after Hurricane Sandy flooded the East Coast and killed over 200 people, a new study has revealed the storm’s lasting impact on mortality risk among older adults. The researchers linked hurricane flood exposure to a 9% increase in risk of death for people over the age of 65 who continued living in the area after landfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22838-1"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Hurricane Sandy caused over $60 billion in damage after it made landfall in 2012. Record-breaking storm surge and catastrophic flooding &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/oct17/sandy-five-years-later.html"&gt;inundated&lt;/a&gt; the coastlines of New York and New Jersey, destroying hundreds of thousands of homes. Over a decade later, affected communities have largely rebuilt, but the storm’s invisible impact on senior mortality risk endures, according to the new study. The findings, published Wednesday, August 6, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1523941/full"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, underscore the need to consider how natural disasters impact public health over the long term, particularly within vulnerable populations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hurricanes and associated flooding and damage impact the lives of those around them; fixing homes, dealing with the stress associated with this all can have long-lasting impacts, which may be seen in terms of mortality,” Arnab Ghosh, senior author and assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We also know from other data from hurricanes that the environment changes in areas that are impacted. Socially, people move away; economically, businesses close. These factors can also limit social networks and friendships, all of which are particularly important in older adults,” Ghosh added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues split the areas that were most affected—New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York City—into 959 zip code tabulation areas. ZCTAs are generalized representations of zip codes that public health researchers use to group demographic and health information by location. Of the 959 ZTCAs, 454 had flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and 505 were within a 10-mile (16-kilometer) radius of flooded areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers then analyzed health data from nearly 300,000 residents aged 65 or older who were enrolled in Medicare and continued to reside in the same zip code area from 2013 to 2017. To isolate the effects of hurricane-related flooding, they controlled for age, gender, race, and living circumstances, as well as other demographic and socioeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that Medicare beneficiaries who stayed in flooding-impacted ZCTAs had a significantly higher risk—9% on average—of death from all causes compared to those living in areas unaffected by flooding. That increase persisted for up to 5 years after the hurricane hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Localized increases in mortality risk varied by region, but not in ways the researchers expected. Medicare beneficiaries living in flooded parts of Connecticut and New York City showed the greatest increases in risk of death: 19% and 8%, respectively. Ghosh and his colleagues were surprised to see that seniors living in affluent Connecticut fared worse than those living in New York City, where socioeconomic and demographic characteristics may result in greater exposure to natural disasters. Further research will need to investigate the reasons behind this, but Ghosh suspects it may be partly related to lack of hurricane preparedness in Connecticut, as this state rarely sees tropical storms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What’s more, hard-hit New Jersey and New York State did not show significant hurricane flooding-related effects on seniors’ all-cause mortality. “We were surprised by this finding,” Ghosh said. In New Jersey, this may be due to the fact that most coastal residences are single-family vacation homes, limiting the consequences of flood exposure, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ghosh hopes that this data will aid disaster relief and preparedness efforts at the local and federal levels. Organizations need to think about not just the short-term outcomes but also the long-term health problems that stem from hurricanes, he said. “We certainly need more policies and infrastructure, particularly as hurricanes become more intense, [frequent], and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;

As of Wednesday, the government reported there had been more than 7,000 cases, mostly in the southern manufacturing hub of Foshan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here's what to know about chikungunya: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means “that which bends up,” due to the severe pain it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe. Those are mostly targeted at travelers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of July, there have been about 240,000 cases of chikungunya, including 90 deaths in 16 countries, according to the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control. The countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An outbreak of chikungunya in Foshan, near Hong Kong, has prompted Chinese authorities to take measures like distributing mosquito nets, having workers spray residential areas, streets and construction sites with insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People who do not empty bottles, flower pots or other outdoor receptacles, where water might accumulate and allow mosquitoes to breed, can be subject to fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,400) and have their electricity cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The U.S. has issued a travel advisory telling citizens not to visit China’s Guangdong province, the location of Donguan and several other business hubs, along with countries such as Bolivia and island nations in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unusually heavy rains and high temperatures this year have worsened the crisis in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was in a coma for six days last year, because I collapsed at home from pneumonia. I was sedated and intubated. I remember not feeling well, and needing to sleep in the recliner, then some blips, a ride in an ambulance, some very violent dreams and nightmares, then literally waking up during a nightmare about attending my own funeral. The nightmares were so real, I can still recount them in detail...it felt like lifetimes. Honestly, it changed a lot about how I view things."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It took me around three days to re-orient to 2024, and that I hadn't died, and hadn't lost our younger son to violence. In fact, I only had one kid, anyway, and he was hale hearty and right there. For days, though, I was suspicious that people just didn't want to tell me that one of my two kids died, he had a name and everything. It was fucking terrifying. I had what they call 'coma dementia' for about 3–4 months after. I had to relearn everything: walking, talking, fine motor skills, everything. I couldn't even feed myself the first week, could basically only move my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have everything back; I worked really hard after that to get healthy and fix so many things. I feel lucky; I got to attend my own funeral, and came back from it. I always appreciated life, but after all that?

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is another key piece, though perhaps not as key as walking. According to the original study mentioned, researchers need more and consistent information on the most beneficial dietary factors and how different foods affect different biomarkers (the latter includes certain proteins, blood pressure and tumors, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s important to note that most current research looks at a combination of factors, not diet alone. “Pairing [walking] with nutrient-rich foods … gives the brain the building blocks it needs to stay resilient,” Zubkov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, knowledge about &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-foods-experts-say-can-boost-your-brain-health-and-help-ward-off-dementia-ano_l_66f567a8e4b064e1788b9cd3" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143"&gt;brain-healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; does exist. The study found positive results with the MIND-diet, or the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It’s a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) antihypertensive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/wp-content/uploads/MIND-Diet-1.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143" data-affiliate="true"&gt;MIND-diet includes&lt;/a&gt; whole grains; dark, leafy, green vegetables; nuts; olive oil; berries; and even red wine, among other foods and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubkov recommended a few key nutrients: omega-3s, antioxidants and polyphenols. More specifically, he encouraged people to eat fatty fish, walnuts, leafy greens and berries, and to drink green tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other ways to generate BDNF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

in the past, doctors say the lung cancer connection is surprising—particularly for non-smokers who developed lung cancer.

The level of processing a food undergoes is classified on something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NOVA scale" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;. It breaks food into these four categories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="12" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;Unprocessed and      minimally processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods are in their natural state      or barely altered, like carrots, milk, and strawberries.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.3.0"&gt;Processed      culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods in this category are minimally processed      through steps like pressing or grinding. Those include things like olive      oil and flour. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.5.0"&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Processed      foods have been changed from their natural state, and typically include salt,      oil, and sugar. Cheeses and canned fish tend to fall into this category.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.7"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.7.0"&gt;Ultra-processed      foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Ultra-processed      foods are processed and include ingredients like artificial colors and      flavors. They also typically have preservatives added for shelf stability      and texture, and are usually packaged. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-lung-cancer" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Why are ultra-processed foods linked to lung cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s important to point out that the study didn’t prove that eating ultra-processed foods causes lung cancer. Instead, it found a link between people who have diets that are high in ultra-processed foods and a lung cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the researchers adjusted the data for people who were smokers—a known risk factor for lung disease—it didn’t break down how much or how long people smoked, points out &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nilesh Vora, M.D.," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Nilesh Vora, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA. It could simply be that people who smoke often are more likely to eat more ultra-processed foods, and that the smoking (not the food) is what raised the risk, he explains. &lt;strong data-node-id="15.3"&gt;Worth noting: People who were non-smokers who ate high levels of ultra-processed foods were also diagnosed with lung cancer in the study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; Still, experts say it’s possible that there is something about ultra-processed foods themselves that may raise the risk of developing lung cancer. “Although ultra-processed foods are not—yet—classified as carcinogens, both epidemiological and laboratory data suggest they may be a potential cancer risk factor,” says &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/matthew-schabath/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/matthew-schabath/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matthew Schabath, Ph.D." data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Matthew Schabath, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Moffitt Cancer Center. “Laboratory studies have shown that components of ultra-processed foods can alter gut microbiota, increase inflammation, damage DNA, and modify gene expression, among other effects. Diets high in ultra-processed foods also promote systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—both of which contribute to cancer development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The lack of nutrition in ultra-processed foods, contaminants from processing and packaging that may be carcinogenic, and additives that are often used with ultra-processed foods, like glutamate (an amino acid used in processed foods as a flavor enhancer) and carrageenan (an additive used to thicken and stabilize food), may also be an issue, according to Dr. Vora. The idea that packaging material and “unregulated glutamate” may raise the risk of lung cancer is “the most compelling” potential reason why someone may develop lung cancer from ultra-processed foods, Dr. Vora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many ultra-processed foods are also engineered products, points out &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/vmac/person/danxia-yu-phd" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/vmac/person/danxia-yu-phd" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danxia Yu, Ph.D.," data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Danxia Yu, Ph.D.,&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Ultra-processed foods are essentially industrial formulations that are extensively processed to be high in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, while low in fiber and micronutrients,” Yu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yu also flags the food additives, particularly emulsifiers and preservatives, as being potentially problematic, along with chemicals from food packaging. Ultra-processed foods have been shown to impact blood sugar and the gut microbiome, as well as raise chronic inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/"

class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with a host of serious diseases, including cancer, she points out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, Yu stresses that it’s hard to draw too many conclusions from this study. “Although there is biological plausibility and epidemiological evidence linking ultra-processed foods to disease risk like the results from this study, we cannot conclude that ultra-processed foods cause lung cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Schabath agrees. “The study is one of the first cohort studies to identify an association between ultra-processed food consumption and lung cancer risk,” he says. “That said, the limited evidence doesn’t mean there’s no association—just that more research is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-cut-back-on-ultra-processed-foods" data-node-id="22"

class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While doctors stress that the link between ultra-processed foods and lung cancer is still being explored, a growing body of research suggests that it’s still best to limit how much of this food category you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re interested in eating fewer ultra-processed foods, it’s helpful to focus on more nutrient-dense foods first, says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink"

Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “Ultra-processed foods become a problem when they displace the fiber, protein, and micronutrients our bodies need to regulate inflammation and repair cells,” he says. “It’s not about swearing off convenience, it’s about making room for foods that do more for you.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To start, it’s best to build your meals around whole ingredients like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and lean proteins, says Keri Gans, R.D.N., author of &lt;em

href="https://www.wired.com/review/whoop-mg/"&gt;but health span&lt;/a&gt;, which is the number of years you’re active and independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="are-you-getting-enough-protein" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Are You Getting Enough Protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Unless you’re in a specific at-risk group, most likely, yes. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347101/"&gt;recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight&lt;/a&gt;, or 0.36 grams per pound. People over 65 may require more, closer to 1.2 grams per kilogram, for maintaining muscle mass. But these estimates are meant to prevent deficiency, not necessarily to optimize health. (You can use this &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine your daily intake.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Most Americans meet their protein requirements without any difficulty," says Amati, and “without having to take protein supplements or any sort of specialized food.” That said, many experts suggest that the RDA is the minimum, not a goal, especially for groups with higher protein demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;These groups include older adults, pregnant or breastfeeding people, anyone recovering from illness or surgery, and those who exercise regularly. Athletes and bodybuilders may aim for up to twice the RDA, but that’s not a general recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="so-how-much-protein-do-you-need" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;So, How Much Protein Do You Need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It depends on your age, activity level, and dietary goals, among other factors. Athletes and bodybuilders, for example, may benefit from eating two to three times the RDA, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7353221/" target="_blank"&gt;according to studies&lt;/a&gt; that show slight improvements in muscle growth and repair at those higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“As folks get older, muscle mass naturally declines,” says Sonneville, referring to a condition &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;known as sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;. “Research suggests that higher protein intake during that time, in combination with resistance training or weight-lifting, can help preserve muscle strength and function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Women going through perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause may need even more protein, since the drop in estrogen accelerates muscle loss and increases the risk of bone conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/osteoporosis" target="_blank"&gt;osteopenia and osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. In those cases, a combination of protein, calcium, and vitamin D can support bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some need less. People with kidney or liver disease, for example, are often advised to limit protein intake to avoid overburdening those organs. And if you’re mostly sedentary, you may not need as much protein as marketers would have you believe. That’s why it’s best to check in with a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But it’s not just about quantity. The quality of protein and how you spread it out over meals throughout the day matters more than hitting any magic number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="protein-quality-and-timing-what-matters" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Protein Quality and Timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit"&gt;Courtesy of David Protein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The most beneficial sources of protein come bundled with fiber, unsaturated fats, and other essential nutrients. That’s why registered dietitians recommend whole foods like legumes, fish, poultry, tofu, dairy, seeds, and nuts over ultra-processed alternatives. Protein bars and snacks may boast high protein counts on the label, but they’re often stripped of the nutritional context. In short, high protein doesn’t always mean healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9rRUF2a0hQWUswVHp2NHVGMWdieWdUcHM2U3BvMWZxMFRLdmx4UHlUdTQ1NlR3UmxlM2s2dnNjb3VENl92c1g1eWR0T2gzUVdId0F4STRTYXVkWGE0d0FSNjFrN0lmQQ</guid></item><item><title>这些症状可能是多发性硬化症的早期预警信号，在诊断前十年- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNN29ORzBTR2FGdk5jalRpaVZXR2ZraUcyTWNUcjdaU082dEphWW1fOWNyWUk3alJvT1JmWmM1MXBXYk1jR3dCeUZVOHZOTVVFT2hlQjlPSWR0aEZZTFoxQnRkclBBbHo3dk1SY0FXNi1vSGFucHVZSjI0eDhtVGJhYTBDdmhmaFFFMUdhS2MxcFh4eTJtdmJiTE5ORzhrUWtKNHpDT0tVMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Signs of a rogue immune system may be present more than a decade before the debilitating physical symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study found poor mental health may be one of the earliest hints of this disease, which impacts about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-may-explain-how-this-virus-can-cause-multiple-sclerosis-in-some-people"&gt;2.8 million people globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of British Columbia epidemiologist Marta Ruiz-Algueró and colleagues investigated the medical histories of 2,038 patients with MS in Canada and compared them to 10,182 patients without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-balance-of-gut-bacteria-could-play-a-crucial-role-in-how-ms-develops"&gt;A Balance of Gut Bacteria Could Play a Crucial Role in How MS Develops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found patients who went on to develop MS had presented to their physicians with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170022" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; more often than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, these clues appeared as early as 15 years before more established symptoms were first detected. &lt;span&gt;The researchers also identified a spike in visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists around 8 to 9 years before their diagnosis. This was then followed by a surge of visits for physical symptoms in the lead-up to diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ruiz-Algueró.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase – where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn't yet declared itself as MS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of poor mental health are common throughout the population, the researchers caution, and most people who experience them will not go on to develop MS. Still, if we can better understand how such signs relate to MS, it may become possible to identify risk factors and earlier interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs – like fatigue, headache, pain, and mental health concerns – can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of British Columbia epidemiologist Helen Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune systems of people with MS mistakenly attack their nerves' fatty protective coating, called the myelin sheath. This can eventually lead to pain, loss of sensation, and loss of motor function in different parts of the body, as the connection between the body and the brain becomes compromised. Fatigue, vision disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction are also common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg" alt="Diagram of neuron damage in MS" class="wp-image-170024 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg 722w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The impact multiple sclerosis has on nerves.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takuya Karasawa, an expert in diabetes and metabolism at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'It's unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers found Ozempic-induced weight loss decreased lean muscle mass in mice by around 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But skeletal muscles shrunk by only around six per cent. By contrast, muscle from other tissue like the liver shrunk by nearly half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then tested the amount of force the mice's muscles exerted and discovered that some muscle strength decreased as the mice lost weight, even when the size of the muscle stayed roughly the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists said this potential loss of strength when taking Ozempic could be a particular concern for adults over the age of 60 who are at a higher risk of muscle loss and reduced mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katsu Funai, a professor of nutrition at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'The loss of physical function is a strong predictor of not just quality of life but longevity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, who weren't involved in the research, however said the findings need to be taken with 'huge helpings of caution'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Lora Heisler, chair of human nutrition at the University of Aberdeen, said: 'What is still an open question is whether the small degree of muscle loss observed in some patients taking Wegovy or similar medicines influences muscle strength or performance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The study suggests that it might do in mice, but there needs to be huge helpings of caution taken alongside this as this study was conducted in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The change in muscle function was only found in one type of muscle, and consistently found with one dose of drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, further research studies are needed in humans to understand the impact of Wegovy and other similar medications on muscle loss, strength, and performance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least half a million &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-5e5593b0-f855-11ef-8279-ffcfdae8d660"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients and some 15million patients in the US are now thought to be using weight-loss jabs, which can help patients lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the numbers using them privately are even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:50:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNUNyV0lZZ3hHRkFxNzhkdVpEVHlSekVxMnBUTzU4eGVrMEV4RlBFbWJTS0trUkpFY0dtVVp5SFRHQXFGcWxFS2NtR1FKOXdBWlBvMGw2TW9BcW5CTnRYWV9TZWdHTXJINDZrT2E4alVxeGJKbzRQZlBSMUlkTmxvcG8tWUlzZnpkVnc2dXMxQW5rSUdCX3B5aFU4ckpCeEsxLU4wWHE1b0hYNXd0OGJFcWNn0gG3AUFVX3lxTE9hSVllZkxZdTZqeEhPeGZ4M0dhWlhsQzFtYkFSOTRjY0xHQkNuN2M0M3hBVGJqV1JqMnFGR2psX2llVkF3MTlOOTRQdTdOVkgyUmJoU18yVzhhZ29vdUh0SVlmZlVXRTNQOTJMeE15bmlIbW5uSkM2dnRXUHpWeVdSYVhlWl91T3FobkhzT2Z3R0FpaEJqT0ZSTkQ1YVFucVRLeDNROWtwemhLYkJXRFNKS2xKdlE2QQ</guid></item><item><title>美国健康的真正问题-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE9Pbm9hMk9IRlpVdUYzaXhyRjY3NDRLLTVtbTBvZXM1OFZtRTVtTFdZQnV4M2hUVFZqdkVsQzlCYUE5UzR3UUcwNElzUUJkZnRTaDNSOTN6V2RTUS1MQnJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-header__restrict"&gt;

At the start of the study, between 1968-1970, 191 of the women completed a maximal cycling test on a stationary bike. They performed various cycling intervals, cycling at a low intensity, and increasing the intensity every few minutes until they reached exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their peak workload achieved at exhaustion was recorded. This was measured in watts, and researchers used it as a marker for their maximal cardiovascular fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women in the study were then examined for signs of dementia in 1974, 1980, 2000, 2005, and 2009. This included neuropsychiatric examinations, interviews with the women, and hospital records. The researchers also looked at socioeconomic factors, like income and education, as well as the women’s diets, smoking habits, and any existing illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that only 5% of the highly fit women, based on the scores in the cycling tests at the beginning of the study, developed dementia, compared to 32% in the moderate group. The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-cycling-3"&gt;How to get started with cycling &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not into cycling, or you don’t have the space to install one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes"&gt;best exercise bikes&lt;/a&gt; in your home, don’t panic.

What’s more, the study only looked at Swedish women. More research is needed into the subject, but staying fit and healthy as you get older is definitely beneficial for your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

Screen time included either watching TV or using electronic devices. Cardiometabolic health data measured cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, waist measurements, blood pressure and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Each additional hour of screen time was associated with higher cardiometabolic risk for both kids and teenagers. Teenagers with excess screen time were especially at risk. Additionally, the risk was heightened for kids and teenagers reporting fewer hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This study helps bolster our confidence in the finding that screen time in youth can adversely impact cardiometabolic health," Dr. Amanda Marma Perak, chair of the American Heart Association's Young Hearts Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Committee, and an assistant professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, wrote in a statement to ABC news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Previous long-term studies have confirmed a link between cardiovascular disease in adulthood and higher screen time in teens. But this is the first study that looked at associations between cardiometabolic risk and screen time for both kids and teens, Perak noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, this does not imply that excess screen time directly affects cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This was still an observational study showing correlation rather than an experiment showing causation," Perak wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another limitation of the study was a lack of distinguishing between screen time used for educational purposes versus more passive screen time like scrolling through social media or texting with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Other studies have suggested that it's the more passive screen time -- like watching TV for older generations, and scrolling social media for today's youth -- that is probably most detrimental, Perak wrote. "On the other hand, more active screen use -- like looking up new information, creating things (like videos or online illustrated books), or communicating (like FaceTime) with friends and family -- may not adversely impact heart health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study highlights the importance of jointly considering screen time and sleep patterns for promoting cardiovascular health in kids and teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak pointed out that youth who spend more time glued to their screens tend to have worse heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"And secondarily, the combination of more time on screens plus going to bed late and/or not getting enough sleep appears to be more harmful for heart health," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak added that she'd like to see more studies to understand the impact screen time may have on long-term cardiovascular health in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Jennifer Miao is a board-certified cardiologist, critical care and interventional cardiology fellow at Yale School of Medicine/YNHH, and a fellow with the ABC News' Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:15:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPWEtmc3VzdGxpWkJ5X0ttVFJJSFlyal9XblJWZVgxcWU4ZzZQNGY3X1V1d0hDUEY4V2IwR203c1RITDhVZGlVa3lKOHZ5eFJQMXRUTXVOSkxGaWdNYzhRclpKcG52TWtGMXdQcmV6dncxOUxDa2JfME9pdnQzUVBseFJBYWR1TE1vU1hwdklaY0JRemxha1BEcNIBngFBVV95cUxPakRfaWR6dFBmM2JyRXZFRVNwWUNqYk9UOVA2T2Q4WER5YVVnZWJmaGZYcDdhc3Q4bEh1MTdndVR0NzZaaTVhTW9Qd0ZVY3hSRlFiQjhadHZZRkNhcndvRC1VdDI2YmJiU3FpaEZuaFdGaldCdGZQTXJOWjBoWlByTjByX3YwdDc2TTdSWjFzV0RnOTFYWlBjWWpkUV9tdw</guid></item><item><title>爸爸惊讶地发现口交导致癌症后以为他从健身房跑了下来- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZ25wcW56a09Id2xoNmhYNjY2ZjVwSjV1anhha2tKbjRENXlLdEJlNDlZSGdiMWhNWm9YT0hhdnpwOVVibWJYbEliLVFRa29SZ2FLN0NxN2VrTFRmcVdsNV9oYWxJZWVRbHFoWlNWN1YxQ0JFYlNVVWtJRmdIMGNGR1FUejZaZXdLcnJodnhxWk5xMDBMY3pWcG83dUdaZzFvOEtuZVNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A father-of-two was left floored after doctors informed him a suspicious-looking lump in his throat was cancer - which they believe was caused by oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank Lane said he initially thought that &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; experts were 'talking a load of rubbish' when they informed him of the intimate source of his illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But after doing some of his own research into &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/warning-sex-act-rise-in-mouth-cancer-574275-20241115"&gt;the link between cunnilingus and mouth cancer&lt;/a&gt;, he realised that the multiple flings he had in his early 20s might be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The HGV driver, from Basingstoke, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, explained that his ordeal first began when he noticed a firm lump in his neck which was 'the size of a boiled egg' two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having a shave, felt my neck and thought 'that feels a bit hard'," Frank said. "It was just a slight swelling.

It is thought the virus may &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/oral-sex-bigger-risk-throat-cancer-doctor-tiktok-803218-20231103"&gt;have a similar effect on the cells of the throat&lt;/a&gt;, although further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The 60-year-old received the diagnosis after a lump appeared in his neck (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV typically does not cause any symptoms, and most people who have it don't even realise, as it can take decades for it to develop into something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-papilloma-virus-and-cancer"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organisation, it usually takes 15-20 years for cervical cancer to develop after the initial HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank, who was in the Royal Corps of Signals for 12 years, said he was told that his biopsy results suggested he'd contracted the virus up to 40 years earlier, when he was just 20 and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having fun, but I wasn't messing about with loads of different girls," he said of his younger years. "When they said I had throat cancer, I thought he was talking a load of rubbish for a split second because I'd stopped smoking 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"[When he said] you've got throat cancer from oral sex...it was a surprise. When I got told, I was thinking 'f*ck that, I'm never doing it again'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He explained that some of his work colleagues 'laughed' and didn't believe him when he told them about the source of his cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The dad has now got the all clear after undergoing treatment (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I told them to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; it and I saw the colour drain from their faces," Frank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In January last year, the dad underwent two rounds of chemotherapy at Henley Hospital in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As this unfortunately didn't touch the tumour, doctors recommended a gruelling six-week course of radiotherapy that blasted the cancer - which he described as the 'most painful thing he's ever experienced in his life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, 16 months on from completing treatment, Frank has got the all clear and is checked over every two months to ensure he's still on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Sharing some tongue-in-cheek advice for others, he laughed: "My advice would be don't have oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"For anyone who can't follow that, my advice would be if you have any unusual symptoms don't ignore them, get it checked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:20:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZ25wcW56a09Id2xoNmhYNjY2ZjVwSjV1anhha2tKbjRENXlLdEJlNDlZSGdiMWhNWm9YT0hhdnpwOVVibWJYbEliLVFRa29SZ2FLN0NxN2VrTFRmcVdsNV9oYWxJZWVRbHFoWlNWN1YxQ0JFYlNVVWtJRmdIMGNGR1FUejZaZXdLcnJodnhxWk5xMDBMY3pWcG83dUdaZzFvOEtuZVNB</guid></item><item><title>救命！我的家人在看到我的戏剧性转变时会失去理智。呃，不太好。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQWjJYczVhNUlzbm1NRVhIUE5nR3EtMXlVNXNhTnFob3J5UDNHYUlGcGpSTEYtMzNNZldURndXcDhYOXRFYVVLWnVGYktrRTV4aGhOSldBTUF5X2tfWnJHZDctWnV1Z2x1a1BnSUNHRUJpeERJQm40Z1pwd3RBOWcwN3B1ZnNUa19RODloVktNVzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnuwz00133b79itodnp3a@published"&gt;I’ve had a very eventful year. At the beginning of 2025, my long-term relationship ended, and after a few months, I decided to move out of state.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmdr2q00143b79qww2ngus@published"&gt;Just before moving, I started a GLP-1 weight loss drug, and I have successfully lost most of the pandemic weight I’d been packing on (yay!). The problem is I’m flying back to my hometown for a visit soon, and I’m quite sure my visible weight loss will be an uncomfortable topic of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmpjql001v3b7925puj50k@published"&gt;My mom has suffered from undiagnosed eating disorders since I was a child, and my aunt, who I’m very close to, is a bit of a fitness and health nut. My aunt has made negative comments about weight loss drugs, suggesting people should “just get off the couch and exercise.” Because of the way my mom and aunt have always talked about fatness and weight loss, I very much do not want to talk to them about my body or disclose that I lost the weight via a GLP-1 drug. I’m otherwise pretty open about my journey to friends who ask. I think it’s helpful for people to know the drugs do work (at least for me!) and don’t think everyone can lose weight via willpower alone, as I certainly couldn’t. What do you think the best approach will be to talk about it as little as possible with my family? I’m anticipating compliments and questions about how I lost the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv0x00153b79g202s6iv@published"&gt;—I Was Pretty (and Fit!) When I Was Fat, Too&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv4v00173b79gf9vembn@published"&gt;You are feeling good about your body and health, and you’re visiting people whom you love (even if you might not always like everything about them that much). This&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; be a good time. So it’s really too bad that this upcoming visit is becoming a source of stress because of all of the baggage and judgment you’re going to have to navigate. It’s hard to have fun and difficult to connect with people when you’re on edge. How can you relax when you’re constantly bracing to hear a comment that will agitate you, chip away at your self-esteem, or take you right back to being a child, confused about why you’re hearing adults obsess over their bodies and the bodies of strangers?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv7a00183b79v35chs0t@published"&gt;I definitely understand that you want to avoid feeling that way. And if you really think the best way forward is to avoid any conversations about your body, you should warn your mom and aunt before you show up. They’ve been obsessing out loud about weight for your entire life, so it’s only fair to give them some time to adjust to the idea that their typical remarks will be unwelcome. Here’s a text to send to the two of them: “Hi Mom and Aunt Barbara, I can’t wait to see you! I wanted to give you a heads up that when you see me, you’re probably going to notice that I’ve lost a few pounds. I know we’ve always talked about weight a lot, but lately, having a lot of attention on the way my body has changed has made me uncomfortable, so I’d rather not discuss it at all. I thought I’d let you know before I arrived. Thanks for understanding, and of course, we’ll have a lot of other things to catch up on!”&lt;/p&gt;

Putting the topic in a category all to itself sort of elevates it to something with special importance. It gives it a lot of energy. And you’re still going to be acutely aware of what they’re noticing, what they’re thinking, and what they’re talking about when you leave. So I wonder if you’d be willing to engage in a brief exchange in which you take control of the narrative instead, responding to any remarks and pointedly— but still breezily and briefly—setting a new tone. Using this approach could go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

I’m so happy for you! I need to lose more, too. I’m on this new diet where you just eat between the hours of—&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, I do feel good in my body now, but I also felt good before, and I know my weight could always change again, so I’m trying not to obsess over it. It just feels sad to think about diets and food all the time. Anyway! Something more exciting that’s going on in my life right now is…&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a personal topic that carries a lot of emotional weight for me after growing up in this family, and I don’t really feel like getting into it. How is your watercolor class going?&lt;/p&gt;

I know you don’t approve and I don’t want to have a conversation that’s going to hurt my feelings. So for the sake of our relationship and having a good time, let’s set the topic aside.&lt;/p&gt;

But I hope doing it your way made you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

supplements—and how a fistful of 'healthy' tablets can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previous &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14765555/warning-popular-supplement-trigger-liver-damage-nerve-problems-kill.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of over 2,000 Britons by Which? found three quarters take supplements, and about one in five respondents take four or more each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, writing for the product testing website, Dr Rachel Woods, who has a PhD in nutrition, said overloading on supplements can cause nausea and diarrhoea, or in more extreme cases, weakened bones and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, when taken in excess, they have been linked to liver, heart, and kidney damage—which can prove fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people take supplements for years without knowing whether they need them or how much is too much,' she &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/five-things-i-wish-people-knew-about-supplements-by-a-nutritionist-262099"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people do not realise, she explained, that fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K aren't flushed out of the body, which can lead to a build-up of harmful levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Too much vitamin D, for example, can lead to a build-up of calcium, which may damage the kidneys and heart, as well as weakening bones,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the spring and summer months the NHS says the majority of people should get all the vitamin D they need through sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutrition expert warned that those who take&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experts warned that too much turmeric in supplements particularly if combined with black pepper can lead to liver damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in the autumn and winter months, people may need to take vitamins to ensure they get the recommended 10 micrograms (mcg) a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is how much adults and children above the age of one need, but babies up to the age of one year only need 8.5 to 10 mcg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advice is that you should never take more than 100 mcg of any one vitamin a day, and children between one and ten should have no more than 50 mcg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies under 12 months old should never have more than 25 mcg of the vitamin per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Woods added: 'High doses of vitamin A can cause liver damage, birth defects in pregnancy, and decreased bone density.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The right amount of vitamin A needed for adults between the ages of 19 and 64 for men is 700 mcg per day, while for women it is 600mcg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS warns that you shouldn't take more than 1.5mg of vitamin A a day which is the equivalent of 1500mcg—but they don't specify if the limit for children is lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Even water-soluble vitamins can cause problems, with long-term overuse of vitamin B6 being linked to nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since most people don't regularly check their blood nutrient levels, they often don't realise something is wrong until symptoms appear.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount of vitamin B6 needed for those between the ages of 19 and 64 is 1.4mg a day for men and 1.2mg a day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the NHS warns more than 200mg a day can lead to loss of feeling in the arms and legs—known as peripheral neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14735763/Safety-warning-popular-supplement-b6-father-vitamin.html"&gt;a father&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have identified a promising nonpharmaceutical treatment that rejuvenates aging brain cells and clears away the buildup of harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;GeroScience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the UC Irvine team reports that a combination of naturally occurring compounds—nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) and epigallocatechin gallate (a green tea antioxidant)—can reinstate levels of guanosine triphosphate, an essential energy molecule in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests on neurons in a dish, the treatment reversed age-related cellular deficits and improved the brain cells' ability to clear damaging amyloid protein aggregates, an Alzheimer's hallmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components," said lead author Gregory Brewer, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor called GEVAL to track live guanosine triphosphate levels in neurons from aged Alzheimer's model mice. They discovered that free GTP levels declined with age—particularly in mitochondria, the cells' energy hubs—leading to impaired autophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when aged neurons were treated for just 24 hours with nicotinamide and epigallocatechin gallate, GTP levels were restored to those typically seen in younger cells. This revival triggered a cascade of benefits: improved &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;; activation of key GTPases involved in cellular trafficking, Rab7 and Arl8b; and efficient clearance of amyloid beta aggregates. Oxidative stress, another contributor to neurodegeneration, was also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions," Brewer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By supplementing the brain's energy systems with compounds that are already available as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+supplements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;, we may have a new path toward treating age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, "More work is going to be required to find the best way to administer this treatment, since a recent clinical trial involving UC Irvine researchers showed that oral nicotinamide was not very effective because of inactivation in the bloodstream."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewer's collaborators were Ricardo Santana, a UC Irvine associate specialist in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biomedical+engineering/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biomedical engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and Joshua McWhirt, a UC Irvine junior specialist who's now a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Screen time doesn't just affect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teens-4-hours-screen-time-anxiety-depression/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It may also take a toll on the physical health of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundbreaking-study-examines-effects-of-screen-time-on-kids-60-minutes/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;children and teens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.24310353" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up," lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about 6 hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged 3 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by "stealing" time from sleep, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health," Horner said. "Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It adds to a growing body of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teens-4-hours-screen-time-anxiety-depression/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/computer-tablet-use-linked-to-angry-outbursts-among-toddlers-research-shows/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;possible effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/parents-kids-and-screen-time-development-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;screen time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and digital devices on young people's health and well-being. In 2023, the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/surgeon-general-social-media-teen-health-vivek-murthy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;U.S. surgeon general urged parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to create "tech-free zones" for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of states now have laws in place to restrict or ban &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cellphones-schools-laws-half-states-ban-regulate/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cellphones in schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and several more have proposed similar legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

href="https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Novel-Entities.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 100 million&lt;/a&gt; “novel entities”, or chemicals not found in nature,

commercial use and production, the report says. But the environmental and human health effects of this widespread contamination of the biosphere are not widely appreciated, in spite of a growing body of evidence linking chemical toxicity with effects ranging from ADHD to infertility to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"environment","tags":[{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"environment/pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Pollution"},{"id":"business/packaging","type":"Keyword","title":"Packaging"},{"id":"campaign/email/green-light","type":"Campaign","title":"Down to Earth (newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"environment/plastic","type":"Keyword","title":"Plastics"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"food/food","type":"Keyword","title":"Food"},{"id":"business/business","type":"Keyword","title":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"Keyword","title":"UK news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/damien-gayle","type":"Contributor","title":"Damien Gayle","twitterHandle":"damiengayle","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/03/Damien_Gayle_v2.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2ee072be7e21a7561b6de0c23d36eaf1","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/03/Damien_Gayle.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=0e1365d1bbeb24c8d2c4e4be7be3ce2d"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-environment","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Environment"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"environment/2025/aug/06/chemical-pollution-threat-comparable-climate-change-scientists-warn-novel-entities","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I suppose that’s the biggest surprise for some people,” Harry Macpherson, senior climate associate at Deep Science Ventures (DSV), which carried out &lt;a href="https://www.deepscienceventures.com/toxicity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the research&lt;/a&gt;, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Maybe people think that when you walk down the street breathing the air; you drink your water, you eat your food; you use your personal care products, your shampoo, cleaning products for your house, the furniture in your house; a lot of people assume that there’s really great knowledge and huge due diligence on the chemical safety of these things. But it really isn’t the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over eight months, as part of a project funded by the Grantham Foundation, Macpherson and colleagues spoke to dozens of researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, and analysed hundreds of scientific papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the DSV report, more than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials – the materials that are used in food preparation and packaging – alone are found in human bodies, 80 of which are of significant concern. Pfas “forever chemicals”, for example, have been found in nearly all humans tested, and are now so ubiquitous that in many locations even rainwater contains levels regarded as unsafe to drink. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global population breathes air that breaches World Health Organization (WHO) pollution guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When these chemicals contaminate our bodies, the results can be disastrous. The report found there were correlational or causal data linking widely used chemicals with threats to human reproductive, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney and metabolic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the main things that came out quite strongly was links between pesticide exposure and reproductive issues,” said Macpherson. “We saw quite strong links – correlation and causation – for miscarriage and people basically struggling to conceive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The DSV research adds to previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/23/earth-breach-planetary-boundaries-health-check-oceans" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;findings by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research&lt;/a&gt; that we have already far exceeded the safe planetary boundary for environmental pollutants, including plastics. On Sunday, another report warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;world faces a “plastics crisis”&lt;/a&gt;, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age amid a huge acceleration of plastic production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report also highlights critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research and testing methods, exposing the ways in which existing checks and balances are failing to protect human and planetary health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The way that we’ve generally done the testing has meant that we’ve missed a lot of effects,” Macpherson said. He singled out the assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are substances that interfere with hormones, causing problems ranging from infertility to cancer. These have been found to confound the traditional assumption that lower doses will invariably have lesser effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the things is that when you have a chemical which is interfering with the endocrine system, it sometimes has a nonlinear response. So you’ll see that there’ll be a response at a very low dose, which you wouldn’t be able to predict from its behaviour at a high dose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;DSV describes itself as a “venture creator” that spins out companies aimed at tackling big problems in environmental and human health issues. Part of the purpose of the report is to identify problem areas that can be tackled by innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;The planet's most important stories.

He cooks with a cast-iron skillet. He especially avoids heating food in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Unfortunately, it is a recommendation to eat more organic food, but it is more expensive in general. So at least washing fruit and vegetables before eating them, but organic if you can afford it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPb21fTDdaVkpyUnFNcDRXSGRlbFN0YjVHT01NLWdvQlFIdktoa0lRWXZtZUVJRVF1aE93RDE0N2lDbFNROTMxOGNGVlJ3c3AzWEtUWHdOZURaTTFFTmVtNG9uN3VEZlZ0dV94a0NaUzJ1YjJXTkFmOEdBZld6MDNWN0xQYS1hUU1YRmVIMGdiY242MlFXMHJKZy04WnJjOU9xVDZQcXJvakMyMzBtRkxraS1kOVFZbVlacmlROVlwQzJ6b3lmejU3MXhQeXI3NVU</guid></item></channel></rss>
