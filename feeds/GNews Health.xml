This makes gait retraining a very promising and effective option for early stage knee osteoarthritis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in the study were aged 18 or over.

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could this be an effective alternative to medication?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/small-change-to-how-you-walk-may-help-relieve-osteoarthritis-pain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB0SXlwZHFJLTV2WTVxWTVLdHp1UFNjSXdZTl9jaGNYRHhzSEZzQTJTLWhZZ2VKVzg5dWdCS1M4UkNXSU00SmNnTlBCN0JhV1RZYm9hR3FrOWpsdURVU1JKMkFhaGRIM1F6OHdwTzRB</guid></item><item><title>具有这种身体特征的男性更有可能患上癌症，专家警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading doctor has warned that 'man boobs' can be a sign of potentially deadly testicular &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a3682a90-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer or liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gynecomastia—when boys or men develop big breasts—can also cause sore or swollen nipples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-a36ae9b0-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says it is 'common' and does not always need treatment, sometimes it can be caused by underlying health issues which need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include kidney disease, thyroid problems or cirrhosis—permanent scarring of the liver often due to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent video posted on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a36ce580-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; which has amassed more than 228,000 views, Dr Surak Kukadia, an NHS GP known as Dr Sooj shared other potential sinister causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The little-known symptom, he said: 'Is such an important sign to be aware of because it could be a sign for so many different things, including things like liver disease, testicular cancer and even breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And yes, men can get breast cancer. It is so important you are aware of that because if you notice any kinds of lumps or bumps in your breasts, it's so important to get checked out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'When you go and see your clinician, we can take a history, we can examine you, and we can even do some investigations like blood tests and hormone profiles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting the video, he received lots of comments from social media users, who shared their personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS GP warned it can be an important sign of several potentially life-threatening illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One user wrote: 'I was diagnosed in 2022 and had an orchiectomy to remove the cancerous testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, we were too late, and it had spread into my lymph nodes and caused me to undergo a Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Please, please check yourself lads.

Many men forget to do the simple weekly checks to check for any lumps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a concerning rise in cancers among young people which has left many experts baffled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men, it is usually treatable with a high survival rate, killing 65 men in the UK each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of men diagnosed with penile cancer early, more than 90 per cent go on to survive at least five years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the outlook for men with the most advanced cancer where it has spread to other parts of the body is bleak, so it is important to catch it early.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other signs of testicular cancer include a lump or swelling, an enlarged testicle, ache or pain in the testicle or the scrotum feeling heavy, firm or hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, breast cancer kills 85 men each year in the UK, with the vast majority of cases occurring in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms in men can include a lump or swelling in the chest or armpit, nipple discharge ,which may have blood in it, sores or ulcers on the chest and a change in the shape or look of the nipple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there has been a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/information-and-support/statistics/"&gt;sharp rise&lt;/a&gt; in liver disease related deaths, with it estimated to kill more than 11,000 Britons each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it was once largely thought to be an illness that affected the elderly and heavy drinkers, it is now rising rapidly among younger adults, with cases in children doubling over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates the condition now affects one in five people in the UK, worryingly with 80 per cent thought to remain undiagnosed because it often has no obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But signs of liver disease include fatigue, feeling weak all the time, loss of appetite, subsequent weight loss, loss of sex drive, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice—yellow skin and whites of the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:14:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R</guid></item><item><title>从Ozempic嫉妒到幽灵般的朋友： GLP-1如何重塑关系-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE15YWZfMjNXSmRQcktNM3pyaDlONHBPVGQ0WUFwMjdFT3huRFBPWWVIUWVNNjczcmFTMHlhc1pwcS1HaFU4d3dDeGVmbjI1Z1lxVWNwM0NMRm81alRvcDM4eGJMSUEzVlZFYTFfaVRIV1Y5VDhIal9TOTV2TzY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

In a Boston suburb, a wife who is struggling to lose weight for lack of a GLP-1 prescription finds herself being happy for — but also sort of resenting — her husband, who’s dropping pounds easily on a weight-loss drug. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I get up early to exercise while he’s in bed or watching the news,” she said. “It gets frustrating. I’m cutting my portions in half, and he wants to go out for ice cream.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, Amanda Torrey, 48, a nanny and a &lt;a href="https://theamandabookverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://theamandabookverse.com/"&gt;romance writer &lt;/a&gt;from Blackstone, is fighting an inner battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’d like to lose 25 to 50 pounds, but instead has been gaining weight. Recently, she saw one of her many friends who is taking a GLP-1. The friend was 100 pounds thinner than she’d been, and looked “adorable,” Torrey said. “And she was feeling great.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Torrey couldn’t get the transformation out of her mind. “Maybe I should just do it,” she told her partner. He’d like to lose weight, too, but they reminded each other about the side effects and how they don’t want to start a drug they’d be on for life, or put themselves at the “whim” of an insurance company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So that was that. Or was it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Everyone else looks so good,” she said wistfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

She only makes more work for me. She leaves dirty dishes, laundry, and everything else strewn about for me to deal with. I have told my husband that it’s time for her to move out, but he doesn’t agree. So now I am stuck taking care of her and her dog, especially now that she has a full-time job. I need help encouraging my daughter to move along with her own life.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to suggest that you don’t need help with your daughter—you need help with your husband! I’m sure your husband is a lovely man, but you would have solved this problem already if he hadn’t objected. So the key to your sanity will be getting on the same page &lt;em&gt;as partners&lt;/em&gt; regarding what you want your home life to be like. After that, you can make a plan to confront your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzrg000s3b79mks119i6@published"&gt;When you told your husband that your daughter needed to move out, what reason did he give for disagreeing with you? Maybe he thinks her presence is somehow good for your health or well-being. He might be under the impression that she provides a kind of companionship you benefit from. Or, perhaps his reasons have more to do with him; being the only caretaker in a home can be a lot of pressure and feel a bit lonely. He may feel relieved knowing that your daughter is there to share the burden, and thus be reticent to give that up. Whatever the case is, he needs to articulate why he wants your daughter to stay. And if she does stick around, he should be the one to either whip her behaviors into shape or make up for her oversights.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vztd000t3b79cq2an2rd@published"&gt;A serious illness is a surefire way to put one’s life into perspective—for both the patient and their partner. It causes some folks to draw their loved ones closer, while others yell, “YOLO” and book a Tanzania safari. Still others work to cultivate a peaceful and tranquil home. There is no wrong response. But in this case, as with most relationship discord, communication is key. You and your husband might not be able to reach a full consensus just yet, but I bet you can get there after a few thoughtful, vulnerable conversations. At the very least, I hope he agrees that dirty dishes and laundry are not a gift you should be forced to “receive” at this stage in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have altered vision, ranging from blurriness to blindness. But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK—a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The procedure can result in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative side effects&lt;/a&gt;, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, presented his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (&lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/events/fall.html" target="_blank"&gt;ACS Fall 2025&lt;/a&gt;) held Aug. 17–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue—it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electric+potential/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electric potential&lt;/a&gt; to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;contact lenses&lt;/a&gt;" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens—about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea—a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, these are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://splashblocker.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largely used in healthcare settings &lt;/a&gt;to protect nurses and doctors from patients' flushed pathogens, says Paddy. There are also air &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;sprays &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; have been demonstrated to be effective in sanitising the air and surfaces&lt;/a&gt; in bathrooms, therefore helping to counteract the dissemination of pathogens via toilet "sneezes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another option is to just flush and then leave the stall immediately. "I usually do the flush and run," says Gerba. He also recommends waiting 10 minutes before going into a public toilet after somebody else, though that might be tricky to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;If you bring your phone to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then there are mobile phones. It's not recommended to use your phone while in the toilet stall, says Roberts – your phone is already exceptionally dirty, as you take it with you everywhere, rest it on every ledge, and touch it all the time. If you bring it to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall, and then you'll carry them around with you even after washing your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The simplest thing you can do is to always wash your hands immediately after you go to the bathroom, says Gerba, who notes that the average person in Tucson, Arizona, only spends 11 seconds washing their hands, while the Centers for Disease Control in the United States &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests handwashing for 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. "Only about one in five actually wash their hands adequately," says Gerba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, to prevent catching a disease in the public restroom, wash your hands. Better still, add an extra step of applying hand sanitiser too, as the combination is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/hand-sanitizer-facts.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;significantly more protective than handwashing alone&lt;/a&gt;. And try not to let the fear of pathogens lurking in toilets keep you up at night – your risk is (probably) lower than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-disclaimer.-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only,-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* Disclaimer.

Eye specialists emphasize that conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even certain cancers can be detected early through a comprehensive eye exam. These changes are usually invisible to the patient but can be identified by trained professionals using advanced imaging tools. Detecting these early signs allows timely intervention, protecting both vision and overall health, and sometimes even saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28369076" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Eye-signs" source="Orion"&gt;Eye signs&lt;/keyword&gt; that unmask systemic diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes offer a unique, non-invasive window into the body’s overall health. A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine highlights that multiple systemic diseases, ranging from diabetes and hypertension to cholesterol disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancers, often manifest subtle signs in the eyes before other symptoms appear. Retinal blood vessels, for instance, can reveal early vascular problems since they are directly observable, unlike most internal blood vessels. Eye care professionals trained to recognize narrowing, deposits, or abnormal pigmentation in the retina are often the first to identify these risks. Regular eye exams therefore provide critical early warning signals that support broader disease prevention and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Basic yoga poses that bring down BP naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes: detected years before other symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is often dubbed the silent disease because it can cause organ and tissue damage long before noticeable symptoms appear. According to the National Eye Institute of the US, diabetic retinopathy is one of the earliest detectable complications. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing swelling, leakage, or abnormal vessel growth. Studies, including a 2025 Medscape review, show these retinal changes can precede classic diabetic symptoms and even blood test diagnosis. Early detection through routine eye screenings is essential, particularly for people with risk factors like obesity or a family history of diabetes. Timely intervention can prevent vision loss and reduce the risk of serious complications associated with prolonged high blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol visible in the eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol often develop silently, causing serious health risks without obvious symptoms. The eyes, however, can reveal early signs before complications arise. Hypertensive retinopathy, caused by prolonged high blood pressure, damages tiny retinal vessels, leading to narrowing, thickening, or bleeding. Similarly, high cholesterol may manifest as yellow deposits on the eyelids (xanthelasma) or cholesterol plaques inside retinal vessels, known as Hollenhorst plaques. The Frontiers in Medicine review and expert insights from clinics like Heart of Texas Eye Care emphasize that detecting these subtle eye changes early can prompt lifestyle or medical interventions that reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and vascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer and neurological diseases can be spotted too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes may also provide early warning signs for certain cancers and neurological disorders. Eye cancers, such as retinoblastoma or ocular melanoma, may first appear as abnormal pigment changes or lesions in the retina. Additionally, systemic cancers sometimes metastasize to the eyes, and subtle retinal pigment abnormalities, such as patterns resembling a bear’s paw, have been linked to colon cancer. Neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and brain tumors, can cause early symptoms like double vision, unequal pupil responses, or sudden reading difficulties. Research shows that visual field testing and detailed eye exams can identify these issues before patients notice significant symptoms, highlighting the critical role of the eye in early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glaucoma and other silent threats detected early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, often called the silent thief of sight, progresses without obvious symptoms until irreversible vision loss occurs. The disease develops when intraocular pressure rises, damaging the optic nerve. A 2019 study noted that systemic factors like age, hypertension, and high cholesterol may increase glaucoma risk. Normotensive glaucoma, where eye pressure remains normal, may result from low blood pressure or conditions like sleep apnea. Early detection through eye exams, including optic nerve evaluation and pressure measurements, allows timely treatment, often preventing permanent vision loss. This reinforces why glaucoma screenings are a key part of routine eye care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why regular eye exams matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine confirms that comprehensive eye exams serve as a frontline tool for detecting hidden health risks. Routine eye care does more than preserve vision; it can uncover early signs of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cancer, and neurological disorders. Eye specialists are often the first to detect subtle changes that other tests might miss. By scheduling regular exams, patients can identify silent threats early, receive timely treatment, and take proactive steps toward maintaining both eye and overall health. Your eyes can truly be a window into your body’s hidden health story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

On August 14, 2025, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), along with a slew of trusted partners, dropped their 2025 guideline for preventing, detecting, evaluating, and managing high blood pressure in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/one-exercise-could-boost-memory-and-reduce-dementia-risk-says-doctor/amp_articleshow/123302302.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-dietitian-recommends-four-foods-to-lower-blood-sugar-to-non-diabetic-level/articleshow/123293218.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Diabetes dietitian recommends four foods to lower blood sugar to non-diabetic level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, nearly half of adults (46.7%) have high blood pressure, and it’s still the single most modifiable risk for death worldwide. This new guideline doesn’t just outline targets, it puts you at the center, blending lifestyle, science, and real-world tools. Whether you’re looking after your own health or supporting a loved one, it's about feeling empowered, not overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Common Blood Pressure Medications Linked to Low Risk of Total Knee Replacement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cloves-10-health-benefits-of-eating-them-daily/amp_etphotostory/123298472.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Cloves: 10 health benefits of eating them daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention first, but be ready to act fast&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the star of the show: lifestyle. Think heart-healthy diet, less salt, exercise, stress management, you know the drill. But the new guidance encourages early treatment, when needed, to help ward off not just heart attacks and strokes, but also kidney issues, type-2 diabetes, and even memory decline and dementia. Yes, that's right. Your brain, too, is in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important step in managing high blood pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A smarter risk calculator: PREVENT&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet PREVENT, the brand new risk calculator debuting in 2023, now officially part of the guideline lineup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates your 10- and 30-year risk of heart trouble by weighing age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and even zip code, as a nod to social determinants of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharper lab tests&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys and hormones get a closer look: the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test is now routine for all hypertensive patients, not optional anymore. . On top of that, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio test, used to detect a specific hormone-driven type of high blood pressure (primary aldosteronism), now applies to more people, especially if you also have sleep apnea or stage 2 hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain health gets a spotlight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, your blood pressure isn’t just a heart and kidney issue, it’s a brain issue, too. Even slight increases can chip away at memory and cognition. That’s why the guideline now targets a systolic (upper number) goal of under 130 mm Hg, especially to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medication gets personalized&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many adults, especially those juggling type-2 diabetes, obesity, or kidney disease, one pill might not do it. The updates encourage starting with drug classes like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics. If stage 2 hypertension (140/90 mm Hg or up), a combo pill, two drugs in one, is often the way to go. And for some individuals struggling with obesity, adding newer options like GLP-1 medications (yes, the ones often in the headlines) may make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy gets a careful tune-up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension during pregnancy is no joke, with risks like preeclampsia or even preterm delivery. The guideline steps up: recommending low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) for some, tighter blood pressure control during pregnancy (140/90 mm Hg threshold), and continued monitoring postpartum, because high blood pressure can hang around after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The lifestyle hot sheet: Real, doable, effective&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s your personal game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt: Keep it under 2,300 mg/day, ideally closer to 1,500 mg.

Jones, M.D., FAHA, dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine in Jackson, Mississippi, and was a member of the writing committee for the 2017 high blood pressure guideline. “By addressing individual risks earlier and offering more tailored strategies across the lifespan, the 2025 guideline aims to aid clinicians in helping more people manage their blood pressure and reduce the toll of heart disease, kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes and dementia,” he told Eurekalert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline, led by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines, has been developed in collaboration with other health care organizations: the American Academy of Physician Associates; the American Association of Nurse Practitioners; the American College of Clinical Pharmacy; the American College of Preventive Medicine; the American Geriatrics Society; the American Medical Association; the American Society of Preventive Cardiology; the Association of Black Cardiologists; the National Medical Association; the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association; and the Society of General Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the 2025 guideline is more than numbers and prescriptions — it’s a roadmap for living longer, healthier, and sharper, reminding us that managing blood pressure is really about protecting the heart, kidneys, and brain for the years ahead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;American Heart Association: https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 04:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，曾经被遏制的疾病已经“复仇” ： “生命将消失” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNLUJSTUdyd3dodE5Qd2JfZ2dFMXJHTVBIcUpqa0pkNWd5Z2NXSkRXZThPR3NzZjRwTWhSR0Y2eVFuTzNoOHhMaEdYNXJyWGg2X0hKVzZ0cDZUUW1jaDFEU3I3SS1rV1I5eHgxLVRWSW13UFlQX29HWnIwUGFBcGowcmVTWEZReS13Wkp3UVVYcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malaria cases have entered a sharp &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/19/health-malaria-mosquito-deaths-zimbabwe-trump-usaid-cuts-disease-control" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spike;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; in Zimbabwe this year after U.S. aid cuts to the country.

But the numbers tell a different story. Every year in the United States, more than 375,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and another 106,000 face gynecologic cancers such as ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer. While the majority of these cases are found after menopause, younger women are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that only breast cancer and cervical cancer have routine screening tools. For most other gynecologic cancers, the first clue is a symptom, and those symptoms are often vague, easily mistaken for stress, diet changes, or common conditions. That’s why listening to your body and acting on unusual changes can be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some surprising warning signs that shouldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在大提顿小屋（ Grand Teton lodge ）内发现蝙蝠群后，数百人可能已经暴露于狂犬病中-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5IQ191ajB0RDBJS0l0elpJeHZpaVBYb0hpU21BVjJYbG10UHdSODliV0ZFbEFoUzROZkVBN0VnXzFkM3pLLWpHd1pZa2hMTzBIVGJReGxFUXZ4MjNEcE9GbUlfWjJNMjNJMURaLW5IdEtzTVZSdm9qYXFHZjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hundreds of people may have been exposed to rabies after a suspected bat colony was discovered inside a lodge in Grand Teton National Park in recent months, national park and state health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bat colony was found over the past few months in cabins at the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/jacksonlakelodgeplan.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jackson Lake Lodge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jackson Lake Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, a popular eco-hotel and historic landmark located in Grand Teton National Park, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Park Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;.

Other bats, including California myotis and western small-footed bats, have also been found at the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The National Park Service noted that less than one percent of bats have rabies and has advised park visitors to follow guidelines to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rabid-bats-sparked-public-health-095106987.html" data-ylk="slk:avoid exposure to rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;avoid exposure to rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Observe wildlife from a safe distance.

			&lt;p&gt;A patient with type 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; has begun producing his own insulin after receiving a transplant of pancreatic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in humans, these islet cells have been genetically edited so they wouldn't be rejected by the patient, removing the need for immunosuppressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes usually begins when the immune system mistakenly attacks the islet cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin. The condition is usually managed with a careful diet and regular insulin injections, but an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-grown-functional-insulin-producing-cells-from-stem-cells"&gt;emerging treatment&lt;/a&gt; involves replacing the damaged islet cells with functional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-treatment-may-cure-severe-type-1-diabetes-study-finds"&gt;New Treatment May Cure Severe Type 1 Diabetes, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new proof-of-concept study, a 42-year-old male patient, who had had type 1 diabetes since the age of 5, received a transplant of islet cells from a healthy donor. The cells were delivered through a series of injections into the muscle of his forearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 weeks, the cells successfully produced insulin in response to glucose spikes, such as after meals. But the most important aspect is that the patient didn't require immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the immune system will recognize the transplanted cells as foreign and destroy them, rendering the therapy ineffective. &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/islet-cell-transplants"&gt;To get around that&lt;/a&gt;, patients are given drugs that suppress their immune system. That solution works, but leaves the patients vulnerable to infections and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before the cells were implanted, three genetic edits were made using the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; tool. Two edits reduced the amount of particular antigens that adaptive T cells use to identify foreign objects. The third boosted production of a protein called CD47, which in turn blocks innate immune cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gene edits were successful, but in a way that provided an intriguing control group. Cells with no successful edits were killed off by T cells within a few weeks, while those that knocked out the antigen production were still wiped out by natural killer cells and macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only those with three successful edits survived, and thankfully there were enough of them in the graft to remain functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg" alt="Islet Cells" class="size-medium wp-image-171389" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pancreatic islet cells stained for glucagon  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; (red) and insulin antibody (blue) under the microscope.

Similar studies in humans have shown promise, but always with the help of immunosuppressant drugs, which bring their own complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cells-reverse-type-1-diabetes-in-clinical-trial"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a young woman in China received a transplant of insulin-producing cells grown from her own  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. Within four months, her body was able to produce enough insulin to stay within a safe blood glucose range for over 98 percent of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers on the new study say that their method could not only make for more effective, safer treatments for diabetes, but could be applied to other types of cells, reducing the need for immunosuppressants with other transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A COVID infection, particularly in women, may lead to blood vessels aging around five years, according to research published in the &lt;i&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Blood vessels gradually become stiffer with age, but the new study suggests that COVID could accelerate this process. Researchers say this is important since people with stiffer blood vessels face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Professor Rosa Maria Bruno from Université Paris Cité, France. She said, "Since the pandemic, we have learned that many people who have had COVID are left with symptoms that can last for months or even years. However, we are still learning what's happening in the body to create these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that COVID can directly affect blood vessels. We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular aging, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronological age&lt;/a&gt; and you are more susceptible to heart disease. If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included 2,390 people from 16 different countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Turkey, UK and US) who were recruited between September 2020 to February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were categorized according to whether they had never had COVID, had recent COVID but were not hospitalized, hospitalized for COVID on a general ward or hospitalized for COVID in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed each person's vascular age with a device that measures how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carotid+artery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carotid artery&lt;/a&gt; (in the neck) and femoral arteries (in the legs), a measure called carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). The higher this measurement, the stiffer the blood vessels and the higher the vascular age of a person. Measurements were taken six months after COVID infection and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also recorded demographic information such as patient's sex, age and other factors that can influence cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking these factors into consideration, researchers found that all three groups of patients who had been infected with COVID, including those with mild COVID, had stiffer arteries, compared to those who had not been infected. The effect was greater in women than in men and in people who experienced the persistent symptoms of long COVID, such as shortness of breath and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average increase in PWV in women who had mild COVID was 0.55 meters per second, 0.60 in women hospitalized with COVID, and 1.09 for women treated in intensive care. Researchers say an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is "clinically relevant" and equivalent to aging around five years, with a 3% increased risk of cardiovascular disease in a 60-year-old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who had been vaccinated against COVID generally had arteries that were less stiff than people who were unvaccinated. Over the longer term, the vascular aging associated with COVID infection seemed to stabilize or improve slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno said, "There are several possible explanations for the vascular effects of COVID. The COVID-19 virus acts on specific receptors in the body, called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, that are present on the lining of the blood vessels. The virus uses these receptors to enter and infect cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This may result in vascular dysfunction and accelerated vascular aging. Our body's inflammation and immune responses, which defend against infections, may also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the reasons for the difference between women and men could be differences in the function of the immune system. Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vascular aging is easy to measure and can be addressed with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs. For people with accelerated vascular aging, it is important to do whatever possible to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno and her colleagues will continue to follow the participants over the coming years to establish whether the accelerated vascular aging they have found leads to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial Dr. Behnood Bikdeli from Harvard Medical School, Boston, U.S. and colleagues said, "Although the acute threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, a new challenge emerged in its aftermath: post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Defined by the World Health Organization as symptoms appearing three months post-infection and lasting at least two months, studies suggest that up to 40% of initial COVID-19 survivors develop this syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This large, multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled 2,390 participants from 34 centers to investigate whether arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, persisted in individuals with recent COVID-19 infection. […] sex-stratified analyses revealed striking differences: females across all COVID-19-positive groups had significantly elevated PWV, with the highest increase (+1.09 m/s) observed in those requiring ICU admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The CARTESIAN study makes the case that COVID-19 has aged our arteries, especially for female adults. The question is whether we can find modifiable targets to prevent this in future surges of infection, and mitigate adverse outcomes in those afflicted with COVID-19-induced vascular aging."&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that microglia, immune cells in the brain, mistakenly remove nerve fibers connecting the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb—two regions essential for processing odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immune-driven pruning occurs when hyperactive neurons display altered membranes, marking them as defective even when they are not. By identifying this mechanism, the study highlights a pathway that could allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment before cognitive symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Misfire:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia break down nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; These changes occur before cognitive decline, making smell loss a potential diagnostic tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may allow earlier use of amyloid-beta antibody treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fading sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease even before cognitive impairments manifest. Research by scientists at DZNE and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) sheds new light on this phenomenon, pointing to a significant role for the brain’s immune response, which seems to fatally attack neuronal fibers crucial for the perception of odors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, is based on observations in mice and humans, including analysis of brain tissue and so-called PET scanning. These findings may help to devise ways for early diagnosis and, consequently, early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers come to the conclusion that these olfactory dysfunctions arise because immune cells of the brain called “microglia” remove connections between two brain regions, namely the olfactory bulb and the locus coeruleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb, located in the forebrain, analyzes sensory information from the nose’s scent receptors. The locus coeruleus, a region of the brainstem, influences this processing by means of long nerve fibers originating from neurons in the locus coeruleus and extending all the way to the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The locus coeruleus regulates a variety physiological mechanisms. These include, for example, cerebral blood flow, sleep-wake cycles, and sensory processing. The latter applies, in particular, also to the sense of smell,” says Dr. Lars Paeger, a scientist at DZNE and LMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that in early Alzheimer’s disease, changes occur in the nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus to the olfactory bulb. These alterations signal to the microglia that affected fibers are defective or superfluous. Consequently, the microglia break them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alterations in the membrane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team of Dr. Lars Paeger and Prof. Dr. Jochen Herms, who is a co-author of the current publication, found evidence of changes in the composition of the membranes of the affected nerve fibers: Phosphatidylserine, a fatty acid that usually occurs inside a neuron’s membrane, had been moved to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer site of the cell membrane is known to be an “eat-me” signal for microglia. In the olfactory bulb, this is usually associated with a process called synaptic pruning, which serves to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional neuronal connections”, explains Paeger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our situation, we assume that the shift in membrane composition is triggered by hyperactivity of the affected neurons due to Alzheimer’s disease. That is, these neurons exhibit abnormal firing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wide range of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of Paeger and colleagues are based on a plethora of observations. These include studies on mice with features of Alzheimer’s disease, analysis of brain samples from deceased Alzheimer’s patients, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smell issues in Alzheimer’s disease and damage to the associated nerves have been discussed for some time. However, the causes were unclear until yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, our ﬁndings point to an immunological mechanism as cause for such dysfunctions – and, in particular, that such events already arise in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” says Joachim Herms, a research group leader at DZNE and LMU as well as a member of the Munich-based “SyNergy” Cluster of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for early diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called amyloid-beta antibodies have recently become available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. For this novel therapy to be effective, it needs to be applied at an early stage of the disease, and this is precisely where the current research could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could pave the way for the early identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, enabling them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention with amyloid-beta antibodies, increasing the probability of a positive response,” says Herms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this olfaction and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08d8192839593ce8e8589949a859294a0849a8e85ce8485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marcus Neitzert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzne.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marcus Neitzert – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62500-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Paeger et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE0zeWhrMnF0VEJDX250U09NQWtmOUltMi1PU3lDb3JNaDBobmdzdEVQZnZnWUJwc29HLWk4M0ZjVG9zX1lTYVlCSWxzbU1JdjFIMHY0SExKX0JnVlBiVDdHaE82N0hVc3FJM3lHYjlJbEwxMGp1</guid></item><item><title>专家说，走路更快，活得更久- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOUkZCaENNR1ZDejNCLVk2X1JWMnIxMHVvY0toSXd2SDhYYTZzY2xjZ0RuQ2NDb3RnTXZ2WVVkQlpuMUlHdkktVXdvam14SWNia0hPUld4NVEtdXhRdEpkM2xBZlFocUV1enlKNENIajB1MUdmc21JaGxPSTlINC11Z1NMdlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Too busy to go to the gym? Don't worry — you can stay healthy by incorporating at least 15 minutes of fast walking into your everyday routine, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it's recommended that people commit to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week to see sufficient health benefits, said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study's corresponding author. But if 150 minutes is too difficult to manage, fast walking a minimum of 15 minutes every day can have the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng and a team of researchers recruited mostly low-income and Black study participants from 2002 to 2009, according to the study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The nearly 85,000 participants were given a comprehensive questionnaire about their exercise habits, average time spent working out, walking speed and health. Then the participants completed a questionnaire about 16 years later, and the analysis began in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know "fast &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51188871" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is good compared to slow walking," but there isn't much research on how many minutes you should spend fast walking on average, said Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and the Anne Potter Wilson Professor in Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, study participants who fast walked for at least 15 minutes every day saw a nearly 20% reduction in premature death compared with a 4% reduction among participants who walked slowly for a total of more than three hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. And it certainly makes sense, because you can imagine, somebody who's in really bad shape is probably not going to be able to walk very quickly," said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking can impact your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has health benefits, such as managing weight and sugar intake, reducing the risk of cancer, easing joint pain and boosting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts "know that when people are exercising regularly, blood vessels can relax and dilate a bit better. And then we also know that exercise is quite good for cholesterol, so it seems to lower cholesterol. And then overall, it reduces the risk of cancer and things that would otherwise hurt people," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily can also lower the risk of dementia or cognitive decline in people predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in daily physical activity, such as walking, promotes better sleep and reduces inflammation, which improves brain structure, according to the Piedmont Medical Center in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to emphasize that these exercises, no matter slow or fast, all confirm some benefit," Zheng said. "But what we find is that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day confirms substantiated benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking has been found to have specific benefits, such as decreasing the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(T)he thought is that exercise has a very big effect on blood pressure, as you may know, and blood pressure, it is one of the more exponential risk factors that we have, for roughly every 20 points blood pressure goes above 120 (what is considered normal or healthy), the risk of a cardiac event roughly doubles," Freeman said. "So, it's a super potent and exponential risk factor, and we know that regular exercise lowers that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, you can tell you're fast walking when you're able to talk but not sing, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can increase your walking pace by a couple of steps and track it with a metronome, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/health/walking-cadence-mobility-speed-endurance-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;July study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I usually recommend that they get up before work, and they go for a brisk walk or a bike or a swim, or they do some high-intensity interval training, whatever it is that they're into," Freeman said. People can go to "a rec center, or they walk outside, if it is safe, or whatever it may be, and just weave it into their day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following good &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/perfecting-your-walking-technique#:~:text=Eyes%20up.,reduce%20your%20risk%20of%20injury." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;walking form&lt;/a&gt;, such as standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms, can help prevent backaches, make it easy to breathe and keep you balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking is a full-body movement. It is not just about your lower body. It's not just one step in front of the one foot in front of the other," said Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, in a previous article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your arm swing is a huge part involved in the mechanics of walking. So, you want to have an arm swing that's coordinated with your foot movement, so it's opposing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take it up a notch? When doing any form of exercise, try to practice conscious or nasal breathing, which is when you inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps regulate blood pressure and can prevent hypertension, according to Santas&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Air conditioning can feel heaven-sent on hot summer days. It keeps temperatures comfortable and controls humidity, making indoor environments tolerable even on the most brutally warm days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some people avoid using air conditioning (AC) no matter how hot it gets outside, out of fear that it will make them sick. While this may sound far-fetched to some, as a microbiologist I can say this fear isn’t altogether unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-to-know-about-a-surge-of-walking-pneumonia-cases-among-young-children"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about a surge of walking pneumonia cases among young children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an air conditioning system malfunctions or isn’t properly maintained, it can become contaminated with infectious microbes. This can turn your AC unit into a potential source of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;numerous airborne infections&lt;/a&gt; – ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sick buildings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/"&gt;“Sick building syndrome”&lt;/a&gt; is the general name for symptoms that can develop after spending extended periods of time in air-conditioned environments. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, congested or runny nose, persistent cough or wheeze, skin irritation or rashes, trouble focusing on work and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to occur in people who work in office settings, but can happen to anyone who spends extended periods of time in air-conditioned buildings such as hospitals. The symptoms of sick building syndrome tend to get worse the longer you’re in a particular building, and are alleviated after you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-germy-is-the-public-pool-an-infectious-disease-expert-weighs-in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How germy is the public pool? An infectious disease expert weighs in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257240"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from India compared 200 healthy adults who worked at least six-to-eight hours per day in an air-conditioned office with 200 healthy adults who didn’t work in AC. The AC group experienced more symptoms consistent with sick building syndrome over the two-year study period – particularly a higher prevalence of allergies. Importantly, clinical tests showed those who were exposed to AC had poorer lung function and were absent from work more often, compared with the non-AC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that AC office workers have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518424/"&gt;higher prevalence of sick building syndrome&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not work in an air-conditioned environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s suspected that one cause of sick building syndrome is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/74/Supplement_1/0/7707269"&gt;malfunctioning air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. When an AC unit isn’t working properly, it can release allergens, chemicals and airborne microorganisms into the air that it would normally have trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/why-is-my-city-under-a-boil-water-advisory"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is my city under a boil water advisory?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning air conditioners can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231099002745"&gt;release chemical vapours&lt;/a&gt; from AC cleaning products or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap/refrigerant-safety"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; into the building’s air. Chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde and toluene are toxic and can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171686/"&gt;irritate the respiratory system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly maintained air conditioning systems can also harbour bacterial pathogens which can cause serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; is the bacteria that causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; – a lung infection contracted from inhaling droplets of water containing these bacteria. They tend to grow in water-rich environments such as hot tubs or air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Legionella infection is most often caught in communal places such as hotels, hospitals or offices, where the bacteria have contaminated the water supply. Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/legionnaires-disease/"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; are similar to pneumonia, causing coughing, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fever and general flu-like symptoms. Symptoms usually begin to show between two and 14 days after being exposed to &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/caused-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-nyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What caused the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in NYC?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;Legionella infections&lt;/a&gt; can be life-threatening and often require hospitalisation. Recovery can take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fungal and viral infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of dust and moisture inside air conditioning systems can also create the right conditions for other infectious microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, research on hospital AC systems has found that fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhizopusspecies&lt;/em&gt; commonly accumulate within the water-rich areas of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;hospital ventilation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/why-coughs-can-linger-long-after-you-recover-from-an-illness"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why coughs can linger long after you recover from an illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fungal infections can be serious in vulnerable patients such as those who are immunocompromised, have had an organ transplant or are on dialysis – as well as babies who were born premature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/environmental-control/air.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; causes pneumonia, abscesses of the lungs, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and skin, and can also infect burns and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/"&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aspergillosis/"&gt;mostly respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and include persistent wheeze or cough, fever, shortness of breath, tiredness and unexplained loss of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral infections can also be caught from air conditioning. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121730259X"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that children in a Chinese kindergarten class were infected with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html"&gt;norovirus pathogen&lt;/a&gt; from their AC system. This caused 20 students to experience the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is usually transmitted through close contact with an infected person or after touching a contaminated surface, in this instance it was confirmed, unusually, that the virus was spread through the air – originating from the air conditioning unit in a class restroom. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160878/#:%7E:text=Vaporized%20material%20from%20infected%20person's,3%2C%207%2C%2015%5D"&gt;Several other cases&lt;/a&gt; of norovirus being spread this way have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/forget-sharks-7-things-water-swimmers-actually-fear"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Forget sharks: 7 things in the water swimmers should actually fear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, air conditioners can also help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/about/index.html"&gt;stop the spread of airborne viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows AC units that are regularly maintained and sanitised can reduce circulating levels of common viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;including COVID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason AC may increase your risk of catching an infection is due to the way air conditioners control humidity levels. This makes inside air drier than outside air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending extended periods of time in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725"&gt;low-humidity environments&lt;/a&gt; can dry out the mucus membranes in your nose and throat. This can affect how well they prevent bacteria and fungi from getting in your body – and can leave you more vulnerable to developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5AB6706237E7ED5AF05FC19B9D4A88FC/S2633289223000017a.pdf/mouth-breathing-dry-air-and-low-water-permeation-promote-inflammation-and-activate-neural-pathways-by-osmotic-stresses-acting-on-airway-lining-mucus.pdf"&gt;deep-tissue infection&lt;/a&gt; of the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are designed to filter air contaminants, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the air we breathe indoors. But this protective shield can be compromised if a system’s filter is old or dirty, or if the system isn’t cleaned. Ensuring good AC maintenance is essential in preventing &lt;a href="https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/ventilation-risk-health-care-associated-infections"&gt;air-conditioner-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The pill was actually made up entirely of a synthetic opioid called nitazene that can be 40 times deadlier &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911513/reason-fentanyl-deaths-decreasing-washington-state.html"&gt;than fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;. Lucci overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, McCallister has heard from other parents in her native Houston, Texas, who say their children’s deaths were also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14582955/drug-nitazene-heroin-UK-US-fentanyl-epidemic.html"&gt;linked to nitazenes&lt;/a&gt;, a class of drugs that health officials worry could drive the next phase in the overdose epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the past two weeks, I would say even the last week, with the interest in Lucci's story, other parents are reaching out to me because they've lost their children,’ she told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Houston has been hit particularly hard by the arrival of nitazene, which first began infiltrating the US drug supply in 2019. From May 2024 to 2025 alone, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-5a3afa80-788a-11f0-8e94-9fe044075bc6"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; DEA agents reported 15 nitazene overdose deaths in people aged 17 to 59, the highest death count since the first drug seizure in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucci’s friend Hunter Clement, 21, was one of them. He took two pills sold to him in April, one a counterfeit Xanax and the other a counterfeit Percocet. He also overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most standard post-mortem drug screens do not test for nitazenes, and the local authorities in Houston did not have the type of comprehensive panel that would detect nitazenes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the two moms took the pills they found near their sons’ bodies to a specialized lab for testing. When the results came back as nitazenes, the women said they’d never heard of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci Reyes-McCallister, pictured with his mother Grey, unknowingly took a pill made up of a synthetic opioid rarely found in the drug supply before 2019. He died at age 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'll never forget when the detective called,’ McCallister, who has a background in pharmaceuticals, said. ‘I had him repeat the name twice. I had him spell it two or three times. I was looking for an active ingredient in there, something I recognized the name of, and I didn't.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they learned was that the pill that killed Lucci was pure nitazene. There was no fentanyl and zero trace of Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In hindsight, McCallister suspects this was not Lucci's first encounter with nitazene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Lucci took a pill and suffered a non-fatal overdose that required five doses of Narcan, the antidote for opioid overdoses, to bring him back to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister thinks nitazene had been pressed into that pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He bounced back because he was terrified, and he was doing better,’ McCallister said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the thing with people of that age is you want to have a social life, you hang out with people, and that usually involves alcohol, and I think that's when the inhibitions slip.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister is currently working with law enforcement to find out where her son had been buying the counterfeit pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucci is pictured at his high school graduation. He aspired to be a tattoo artist and had been working in a prestigious apprenticeship when he died&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci and his mother were very close. McCallister talked to him 'a gazillion times a day,' she told the Daily Mail, exchanging texts, calls, memes, and silly videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Lucci’s family checked in with him ‘a gazillion times a day,’ his mom said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family exchanged calls, texts, memes, and funny videos. But on the day he overdosed, they began to worry when they hadn’t heard from him for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was found dead in his apartment on January 26 with two pills nearby pressed to look like Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He had a fulfilling life. He had a family that loved him. He was doing great,’ his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Clement, mourning her son’s death a few months later, learned of Lucci’s passing, she immediately connected the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to McCallister and, from there, had two pills left near Hunter’s body tested more comprehensively for the toxins that a standard screen could not detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clement found Hunter one April evening after a long day at work. Hunter had come home the night before, apparently drunk, sparking worry in his parents. Perhaps he had taken half a pill, she thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Lucci, Hunter had been doing well. He had been introduced to the pills by a friend the previous year, likely not knowing they could contain fentanyl or nitazenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had a few rough months, but he never overdosed or needed Narcan. And his personality hadn’t changed much. From December through his death in April, he was the same son they knew and loved, his mom told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter took what were sold to him as Xanax and Percocet and fatally overdosed in April at 21. Further testing found the pills were made up entirely of the same nitazene that killed Lucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter is shown third from left surrounded by his family. According to his mother, he was his niece's favorite uncle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that night in April, his parents feared Hunter had made a sharp turn down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The next day, when I went to work, he was sleeping. My husband went and checked on him around noon. He was sitting up in his bed,’ Clement told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then, when I got home, I found him in his bed, and he must have taken one of each [counterfeit oxycodone and counterfeit Xanax].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first version, or analog, of nitazenes was developed in the 1950s as a potent opioid painkiller, but was never used in medicine due to its dangerously high overdose risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But still deadlier analogs of the original, like N-pyrrolidino protonitazene, which killed Lucci and Hunter, have resurfaced since 2019, infiltrating the illicit drug supplies of Europe, the UK, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Renna, Assistant Port Director for Cargo Operations at JFK Airport in New York City told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/buyer-beware-bad-actors-exploit-de-minimis-shipments"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt; in May: ‘Earlier this month, we seized almost a pound of nitazene that was going to a private residence in South Carolina. It was shipped from the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Unfortunately, here at JFK, we’re seeing xylazine and nitazenes at least a few times a week in quantities ranging from just a few grams to upwards of a pound or more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter's mother said he had a great sense of humor and took his role as an uncle very seriously. He had been doing well in the months leading up to his sudden overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is still steeped in a years-long opioid overdose crisis that is believed to have killed more than 800,000 people since it began in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, the US overdose death rate decreased by four from 2022 to 2023, dropping from 32.6 to 31.3 fatalities per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline is promising, but the increasing danger of another deadly synthetic opiate has overshadowed public health officials' optimism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the threat of a new wave of the opioid epidemic taking form, parents like McCallister and Clement have channeled their grief into an awareness campaign by sharing their sons’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sadly, it just takes one pill, or one line of something, or, heaven forbid, in the future, a hit off of a vape,’ McCallister said. ‘I mean, this is very dangerous territory we're wading into.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:56:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在曾经被遗弃的德克萨斯州小镇，甜蜜的复兴之花再次绽放--MySA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOcEl3VlQ0c1NrZ3dDUzF5RTlYakVNbmE3RWdKM0pnYUtWUlZHUkRldVpYWnM4cldnTFpRLUNvTXVlTVR2MnR3QTVOdmEtQ2R0ZWdfVWIwM3RhZ2luNEhFenNLOHZxdWVyWTVZQ3hrQW9XMnRadXRfQ2RwN2ViMGxsWUg4Q2czdUsyZnptVUNDMUQ2b0VOVHFFZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exterior of the Waring Market, which offers gallery space for local artists.

The space sat empty for more than a decade until she and Gonzales, brought together by their connection to Miss Jennie, decided to revitalize it as both a gallery and a bakery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-mysanantonio.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, the pear tree began growing, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbie Cotrell, owner of the Waring Market, next to a 100-year-old pear tree that has recently sprung back to life.

Around its large eyes come black slithering masses that twist and writhe like Cthulhu's tentacles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under its mouth extend two dark, forked barbs, a veritable pair of outgrowths that resemble vampire fangs, suggesting it has truly become a monster. With the transformation complete, the creature emerges from the brush to reveal, not a Lovecraftian horror beyond human comprehension, but a common cottontail rabbit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This particular species, ubiquitous in Wyoming, is experiencing the effects of a seasonal surge in Shope papilloma virus, a disease that causes the growth of dark structures made of keratin around a rabbit’s face and neck. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Images of rabbits with this bizarre affliction have made waves across social media, with many likening their strange visage to that of Frankenstein’s monster or an undead zombie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While no infected rabbits have been spotted in Wyoming, some have made their way as close as Fort Collins, Colorado, sparking speculation they may soon cross over into the Cowboy State. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Sightings of “zombie rabbits” near Fort Collins have sparked a wave of speculation about what those horned critters are. Turns out they have a rare disease that causes growths all over — and likely the origin of Wyoming’s mythical jackalopes. (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Up, Doc?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laurie Hess, an exotic pet veterinarian in Bedford Hills, New York, told Cowboy State Daily the disease is normally not life threatening to a rabbit. She said the emergence of these horn-like growths is similar to the way warts appear in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s been around forever, it’s a virus, it’s nothing new and it’s being sensationalized because people are seeing what it can do to wild rabbits,” Hess said via phone. “These rabbits look freakish but usually these [growths] are benign things, sometimes they will kind of fall off and go away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just the way the body reacts and walls off this virus as it divides, and it forms this pile of protein that happens to be in the shape of a horn,” Hess added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In rare exceptions the growths can develop into malignant cancer but are otherwise harmless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The good news is, it’s not transmittable to people, it’s not transmittable to other pets other than rabbits,” Hess said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hess said the appearance of such growths is specific only to rabbits, even though different types of papilloma viruses exist in other species, including humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the strange twisting horns caused by Shope papilloma virus have drawn comparisons to the zombie Cordyceps fungus popularized by the HBO series “The Last of Us,” Hess said the disease is something entirely different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fungus is an environmental thing,” Hess said. “Even athlete’s foot is a fungus, it lives in the gym in the drain, and you step in it and you get it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shope papilloma virus“is not like a plague spread through the air, it’s not like that, it’s not like COVID where you breathe the same air as someone with COVID has,” she added. “It has to be a transmission and it’s usually through insects.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A late summer resurgence of mosquitos, therefore, creates prime conditions for the spread of the shocking malady. Hess added that owners of exotic pets, such as rabbits, should make sure to bring them to the vet at least once per year to monitor for similar strange diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though Wyoming has yet to see any infected rabbits, the state Game and Fish Department confirmed to Cowboy State Daily in an email that it is monitoring the rabbits’ movement through northern Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;State officials do not have plans to intervene should the rabbits cross into the state, though, as Shope papilloma virus does not threaten any local wildlife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While this infection does look alarming, it is not fatal unless it interferes with the animals' ability to eat and drink,” Public Information Officer Amanda Fry wrote via email “We do recommend that you do not handle these animals, and give them space if you come across one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ultimately it is not a serious threat to rabbit populations, nor their role in ecosystems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;The legend of the jackalope might have started with pioneers in the 1800s seeing rabbits infected with viruses that can cause horn-like growths. (CSD File)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legend Of The Jackalope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though horned rabbit sightings can be explained by science, that doesn’t stop some Wyomingites from speculating they are connected to a greater mythos rooted deep in state history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The city of Douglas, Wyoming, &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/11/jonesing-for-jackalopes-douglas-cant-get-enough-of-these-mythical-antler-rabbits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;credits the Herrick family&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the invention of the mythical jackalope, an animal with a jackrabbit's body and the antlers of an antelope. Luke Herrick, a third-generation taxidermist in Douglas, said the legend originated from his grandpa Doug, who one evening happened to toss a rabbit carcass next to a pair of antlers on the floor of his shed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They decided to try mounting one up,” Herrick told Cowboy State Daily via phone. “My great grandmother, Doula Herrick, she was the one that named it. She said ‘let’s call it a jackalope.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mounted Jackalopes, Herrick added, have since become a signature offering of Douglas’s Herrick Big Horn Taxidermy. Herrick said a typical jackalope mount will cost about $55 to create, which he can then sell in his shop for $155.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We sell twice as much [jackalopes] as we do our little animals,” Herrick said. “I took it over from my dad and he was doing 3,000 jackalopes a year and he still couldn’t keep up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Herrick said he was unfamiliar with a connection between jackalopes and Shope papilloma virus, he said the legendary creatures feel as real to him as any other animal he mounts in his shop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It almost sounds funny but they’re real to us, to me,” Herrick said. “I grew up with it ever since I was born.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class="_1eyampx0"&gt;&lt;div class="splide"&gt;&lt;div class="splide__track"&gt;&lt;ul class="splide__list"&gt;&lt;li class="splide__slide n1n9p20"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Douglas, Wyoming, has adopted the Cowboy State's mythical critter — the jackalope — claiming it was created by a local taxidermist in 1939.

It doesn’t deliver jellybeans and eggs like its cousin the Easter Bunny, but instead sings cowboy songs, drinks whiskey and mates only during electrical storms. Rose said this mystique likely contributes to the jackalope’s staying power throughout the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think people just love mythology,” she said. “It’s kind of a cool thing and you’ve got Greek mythology, you’ve got Loch Ness Monster, you’ve got all these things out there and it just grows.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have seen in the past couple of years people coming, just like they go look for The Mothman,” she added. “They’ll go on vacations based on these mythical creatures, so we have had people come here just to see the jackalope.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legend has since become a major part of Douglas’s identity, even featuring the jackalope on part of its city emblem. Rose said the museum where she works produces an array of touristy merchandise from jackalope milk to tongue-in-cheek jackalope hunting licenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The license, issued by the City of Douglas, permits the bearer to hunt jackalope from 12-2 a.m. on “June 31.” Different iterations of the license will sometimes list penalties for noncompliance, such as the 2022 version which threatens a $13 fine or “13 months hard play in Douglas, Wyoming.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herrick said the joke sometimes goes over the heads of eager hunters who set out in search of the rare game anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I know one instance, a guy was out hunting, shotgun out, and he was walking through the sagebrush looking for a jackalope and a game warden pulled up and asked him what he was doing,” Herrick said. “The game warden told him the truth and that guy was pretty p—ed off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it remains possible a hunter could mistake a rabbit with the Shope papilloma virus for a jackalope, hunters aren’t allowed to shoot it. Jackalope season, according to the city of Douglas, ended more than a month ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cottontail rabbit season, meanwhile, starts on Sept. 1 in Wyoming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackson Walker can be reached at: News@CowboyStateDaily.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPUHY1QUJiSkVQU19uUnM2LTVXdnM5bkp3T05iVWc4dUhlRXN5MTlGdVdNSmFIOW05eTVVVEktSWQ1MEtySTc2b01rdWU3c0g0eEp6THRQQXFLaWZtbDlCaGZFY1J1YU9yTGtJQTMxNk1kY1ktcnJTN01fSmFxWXB2WnRrc1VjS2pRLUdydUd6WENqYkVQTFBnZ1FlQzV6eW05WXBkMmR5NnU3T1ByM1pvb3FVZ0I</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团病集群增至100多例，包括4例死亡--WGAL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPZ0YtYWs3Q0N4LXZCR1JjZ1NIeDlkbEZuNTB6RGx5aldiREo1VWxhaXpKNjA4SG12Rk0zc18yTjFpRzBpaHF3eUFZLW9Ta3BGVUdoOUNKdGI5RTBhTGNMN25Sb2N6UnBwS2U4MS14N2tYT0plZU9CWnhaMUNfRmdjYWZGcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content--body-inner"&gt;

						Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires' disease in Central Harlem has grown to 101 cases, including four deaths.Health officials suspect the bacteria that cause the disease, Legionella, originated in cooling towers — devices that use water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn't properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.On Thursday, the New York City Department of Health confirmed positive tests of the bacteria in 12 cooling towers serving 10 buildings in the area, including NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem.The health department says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired, and the final tower was to be remediated by Friday.Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings."This community outbreak is not related to a building's hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner," it said.The current Legionnaires' cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation."The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained," Morse said. "New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome."Legionnaires' disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of us eat enough protein. But there are exceptions, like illness or intense exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your body doesn’t get the protein it needs, it sends you subtle hints. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include bad mood, frequent illness or trouble bouncing back from exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes, getting the nutrients you need can feel like trying to balance a seesaw. Just when one side is steady, the other starts to tip out of balance. Protein is a perfect example. While most of us are meeting the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimum protein requirements&lt;/a&gt;, that doesn’t mean we’re always consuming enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; to match our activity level, support our unique health needs or accommodate dietary restrictions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that your body will often send you hints that you’re not getting enough of this nutrient. However, they’re not always obvious, and some of them may be downright weird. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, we asked dietitians to share the under-the-radar signals that you need more protein. Here’s what to look out for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever finish a snack or meal but still feel unsatisfied? Or, maybe you’re hungry again soon after you’ve eaten? “Not eating enough protein can leave you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031222/reasons-why-you-wake-up-hungry/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feeling hungry&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="http://djblatner.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. “Protein boosts hormones that make you feel full, so skimping on protein can leave you constantly reaching for snacks.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This can help you feel more satisfied after meals. And if your goal is weight or fat loss, she says, a “protein prescription” can help control hunger and appetite between meals and preserve muscle mass in the process. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you get sick more often than normal, it may be another sign of inadequate protein intake,” says &lt;a href="http://kellyjonesnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelly Jones, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. After you eat protein, your body breaks it down into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein building blocks&lt;/a&gt; called amino acids, she says. These amino acids are then used to create immune cells and antibodies, which are your body’s front-line defenders against illness. But if there are not enough amino acids on tap, your immune system may not be able to do its job effectively. This may raise your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7594934/how-to-actually-boost-your-immunity-and-not-get-sick/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;risk of catching colds&lt;/a&gt; or other infections. “It may also take you longer to bounce back when you do get sick,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-your-muscles-ache"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Your Muscles Ache &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your post-exercise &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sore-from-workout-what-to-do-to-feel-better-11721347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle soreness&lt;/a&gt; is an issue, you may want to consider your protein intake. “Consistent muscle soreness or weakness, especially if you’re not heavily training, may hint at low protein, since it’s needed for muscle repair and recovery,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nutritionfp.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tony Castillo, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. When your body doesn’t get sufficient protein from food, it may start to break down muscle tissue to get the protein it needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This, in turn, may translate to sore muscles. Fortunately, research has found that consuming protein during or after exercise may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-drinks-for-sore-muscles-8364146" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;speed muscle repair&lt;/a&gt; and alleviate some of those muscle aches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-youre-not-hitting-your-fitness-goals"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You’re Not Hitting Your Fitness Goals  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;If you're putting in the work with a fitness routine that involves both cardiorespiratory and strength training, but not seeing improvements in muscle strength or body composition, inadequate protein intake may be the culprit,” says Jones. That’s because active people have higher calorie and protein needs. However, if those needs aren’t being met, your body may burn the protein you eat for energy instead of using it to build muscle, she explains. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s after surgery, an injury or even a scrape, there are times when we all need to heal. During these periods, our protein needs increase. “If protein intake is inadequate, you won’t have #alltheheals,” says Bonci. Without enough protein, your body will lack the raw materials that it needs for tissue repair and remodeling. All of this can delay recovery and healing, which might be otherwise prevented by consuming enough protein, she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Your Hair, Skin and Nails Don’t Look Healthy  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want the secret to lustrous hair, glowing skin and resilient nails? It might be more protein. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similarly, if your nails are splitting, peeling or breaking more easily than usual, it could point to inadequate protein intake, says Castillo. “Protein is a key building block for keratin, the main structural component of nails.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, poor nutrition in general can have a marked impact on nail health. So, a well-balanced diet with adequate protein can only help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jones notes that poor skin health can also be a sign you’re not getting enough protein. That’s because your skin is composed of structural proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep it smooth and firm. Without enough protein to supply the amino acids your body needs to make these structural proteins, your skin may start to sag, and fine lines and wrinkles may set in.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve got a case of the grumpies, it might be your diet.  “Increasing your protein intake by even 10% may improve your mood and help get your emotions back on track,“ explains Blatner. While the reasons aren’t entirely understood, one study suggests that eating additional protein may help your body produce more of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not the only way protein may help balance your mood. This nutrient also helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which may prevent the mood dips that often accompany blood sugar crashes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

When this happens, some weird signs may appear. Sneaky signs that you’re not getting enough protein are feeling hungry all the time, muscle soreness, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292168/5-weird-signs-you-may-not-be-getting-enough-protein/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lackluster hair, skin and nails&lt;/a&gt;. You may also have difficulty hitting your fitness goals, bouncing back from injury or illness and even feel more depressed or moody. If you notice any of these signs, it’s a good idea to check in with your health care provider or a registered dietitian nutritionist. They can take a close look at your diet to see if insufficient protein is what’s causing your strange symptoms, and help you develop a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; to get the protein you need to feel your best.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh30001b3b79obu6o8qk@published"&gt;I’m a 45-year-old gay man working through complex sexual trauma and am relatively new to sobriety. For the first time in years, I feel mentally ready to connect with others, and I’m seeking a casual friends-with-benefits situation—something low-pressure but meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh76001c3b79hrnxv6nk@published"&gt;Here’s the issue: receiving oral sex is physically difficult for me. I’m well-endowed, and new partners often get excited to go down on me—but I tend to go soft during the act, no matter what I’ve tried (even Viagra). It’s not about shame or lack of attraction. It’s a trauma response. But of course, I can’t unpack all that with a hookup I just met, and many men take my reaction personally.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhb0001d3b79zahtfh88@published"&gt;It’s a similar story with giving oral. I’m a bottom and want to please my partners, but the act can trigger me. I want to be upfront, but not in a way that overshares or kills the mood. How can I communicate this early on in a way that’s honest but doesn’t derail the whole experience?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhld001g3b79tg296rft@published"&gt;It is reasonable, de rigueur even, to spell out what you are (and, in some cases, aren’t) into before a hookup. If you’re meeting guys via apps, this can be as simple as including info in your profile (“No oral, only anal,” for example), or letting them know during your coordinating chat. If you’re meeting guys in person, a brief conversation explaining your boundaries should also suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhpf001h3b79tmsc0tft@published"&gt;However, know that this may derail the experience for some potential partners. I think your main task is getting to be OK with that. If people can’t abide by your boundaries, they aren’t worth your time. People may filter themselves out if they’re looking for oral, and a lot of them will be. Guys, even the top-identified, may be drooling for your big dick, but bottoms who don’t want their dicks played with are fairly common. That’s not going to shatter a seasoned top’s understanding of the universe. I think you’ll find that what is more of a dealbreaker is you not wanting to suck, but I think you’ll still do fine even with that boundary stated up front. Anecdotally, I see tops in hook-up profiles advertising that they just want anal. They are out there. As with any interest/disinterest that deviates from the status quo, this is just about finding your people, and that process involves rejecting others as you shuffle through. Just be patient and know that if anyone turns you down as a result of your interests, it’s not personal. After all, they won’t yet know you well enough for it to be personal.&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to dating him, I lived a very sexually active life and was very involved in the hookup culture. While I don’t judge others for the choices they make when it comes to their sex life, I’ve come to realize my promiscuity was born from a desire to be accepted and from a desire for intimacy. It has taken a lot of work to work through the shame and the guilt I have felt from abusing my body and giving it away so liberally, but I’m slowly accepting my past as a part of my journey of growth and looking at my past self through kinder eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhyx001k3b79lozavva8@published"&gt;With all that said, my partner and I have a very active sex life. Sex with him is by far the best I’ve ever experienced and it seems like each time he’s coming up with new ways to please me. On the other hand, while I have had quite a few hook ups in the past, they really haven’t required me to get very creative or to put in a lot of work. My partner only tops so I am the bottom in our relationship. Aside from riding, what other positions would work well for a bottom looking to please their partner? Also, while I love giving him oral, his penis does curve which triggers my gag reflex. I love this man so any suggestions on how to please him in the same way he pleases me would be most appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

You say that tops in the past haven’t &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; you to get creative. Is there anything different about this current relationship that would cause you to feel required to do so? If not, you’re probably fine—some tops just want to be able to do what they will with a hole, little-to-no work required on the bottom’s part other than being receptive. There’s a reason why topping has been traditionally considered the “active” role: It tends to require more physical work. Things don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be this way, but what it could mean for you is riding low expectations all the way to mutual orgasms for you and your partner. I get the sense that you want to surprise your partner with new tricks, but in terms of the vibe and actual sensation, these may not be his thing. You would do better to have a conversation ahead of time about whether or not there’s anything he’d like you to do. The fact of the matter is that any and all positions could work well for a bottom looking to please their partner … depending on the top’s taste and the bottom’s willingness. You wrote a rave review of your sex life so this might be a don’t-fix-what-isn’t-broken situation.&lt;/p&gt;

See if he’s into it. And for oral, try coming at him another way. If you tend to approach from below (as in, him standing while you are kneeling or even if he’s lying down and you situate yourself between his legs), instead approach from above. Have him lay on his back and approach from the top (as if in a 69 position). That can help with accommodating, depending on his curve. You could also try laying on the bed with your head over the edge and have him thrust into you. Again, it will depend on his curve but that could help you take him (tell him to go easy, especially at first because an overeager top thrusting deep can also make things more difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

Lately, though, she’s been having flare ups of chronic pain after receiving (the orgasms are so intense they activate it).

When you add that to busyness, dealing with childcare, and general exhaustion, we end up having infrequent sex that leaves one of us unhappy. I’m usually a hot and ready girl, but I’m just not in the mood given everything, and the pattern of me not being able to get turned on has really hurt my partner’s feelings and led to her feeling blamed and rejected. I just want to get back to feeling horny and having excellent sex! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

You have generously accommodated your partner’s limitations, but it seems that it’s at your expense. More tinkering may be in order. The troubleshooting that needs to be done is figuring out how you can mitigate your partner’s pain while facilitating your pleasure. This will require working together closely, and that I think might be the biggest hurdle here.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvts00223b79xyn2o4sr@published"&gt;It’s going to be hard to collaborate in such an intimate space when there are negative feelings pervading it. It’s likely that your issues here go way beyond positioning—the shame that has entered your bedroom could be just as big of an impediment, if not more so. Your partner’s reactions have not been ideal. It seems that she is honest in her expression, but she hasn’t been extending the kind of sensitivity that you need. She doesn’t have to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; your squirting but she should accept it as part of your body’s functionality. Not doing so risks you feeling rejected. It seems that she has also taken personally your body’s reaction to the changes you’ve integrated. That’s a choice she doesn’t have to make. It may be disappointing, even upsetting, that your solutions for managing her pain didn’t fall perfectly into place for both of you, but this is a practical matter. At the very least, there’s an alternate interpretation for your response that doesn’t involve your body unconsciously snubbing her. Why is she opting for that one?&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvtt00233b791sus6uge@published"&gt;I don’t know what your dynamic is like, and I don’t know how your own behavior and reactions have contributed to it, but what I read was a letter from someone who has done a lot for their partner and it’s still not good enough. Whether you are being treated unfairly or are extremely sensitive to your partner’s feedback (or a little bit of both) is for you to determine. Clarity there will help further conversations on this matter. There may be ways to reconfigure your sex so that you are both satisfied. It won’t necessarily be at the same time—maybe one session is tailored to your pleasure, the next to her’s. Obviously, you may be limited by what her body has the capacity to endure, but she may also need to compromise a bit. Maybe there’s a position that is good for your pleasure/orgasms that isn’t strictly comfortable for her, but also isn’t so uncomfortable as to be unpleasant. If she won’t approach either your conversations about emotions or strategizing for sex with a sense of compromise and collaboration, that’s data. It indicates there’s more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 20, 2025, Russia will launch the Bion-M No. 2 biosatellite atop a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, marking a key step in studying the effects of spaceflight on living organisms. As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/russia-to-launch-75-mice-1-000-fruit-flies-on-aug-20-to-study-spaceflight-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the spacecraft will carry&lt;strong&gt; 75 mice&lt;/strong&gt;, over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt;, and other biological specimens for a 30-day mission in space, exposing them to high levels of radiation. The goal is to gain insights into the biological effects of space travel, crucial for advancing deep-space missions and understanding long-term impacts on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Noah’s Ark” for its diverse payload, the mission also carries lunar simulants—dust and rocks mimicking materials found on the moon’s surface. These simulants will be studied after returning to Earth to assess how they react to space radiation and the vacuum of space, aiding plans for future lunar construction. The mission aims to gather critical data on microgravity and radiation’s effects on organisms, with potential applications in astronaut health and space medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examining the Impact of Space Radiation on Mice and Other Organisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key experiments onboard the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 &lt;/strong&gt;mission involves studying the effects of space radiation on mice. These animals were chosen for the experiment due to their genetic similarity to humans, their short life cycles, and their heightened sensitivity to radiation. This experiment could have wide-reaching implications for human space travel. The mice will be divided into three distinct groups: the first group will live in normal conditions on Earth, the second group will be housed in a simulated flight environment on Earth as a control, and the third group will spend 30 days in orbit. The results will allow researchers to compare the health and biological responses of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice will be monitored closely throughout the mission. Each mouse-carrying unit is equipped with essential systems, including feeding, lighting, ventilation, and waste disposal mechanisms. Specialized &lt;strong&gt;cameras and sensors &lt;/strong&gt;will provide real-time data on the mice’s condition, and some rodents will be implanted with chips to track physiological changes. Upon return to Earth, the researchers will analyze how the mice adapted to space conditions and how they readapted after returning to Earth’s gravity. This data will help scientists understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on living organisms and the potential risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunar Simulants to Test Space Effects on Moon Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another significant component of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2&lt;/strong&gt; mission involves the study of lunar simulants. These are materials designed to mimic the dust and rocks found on the moon’s surface, specifically those from the high latitudes. The purpose of this experiment is to assess how space radiation and the vacuum environment affect these materials. The results of this experiment will have broad implications for future moon construction projects, where the ability to use local materials to build structures will be critical for long-term lunar habitation. The lunar simulants will be carefully analyzed after their return to Earth to see how they were altered by their exposure to space conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the &lt;strong&gt;Vernadsky Institute &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;IMBP &lt;/strong&gt;in preparing the lunar simulants underscores the importance of this mission in advancing the scientific understanding of space construction materials. The testing of these materials in space will also help scientists determine how radiation and microgravity might affect future building materials used in extraterrestrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Spaceflight Impacts the Biological Health of Organisms in Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bion-M No. 2 mission &lt;/strong&gt;will collect invaluable data on the biological effects of spaceflight, specifically focusing on how organisms respond to microgravity and radiation. Researchers hope to gain insights into how these factors contribute to the deterioration of biological systems in space. The experiment will provide essential information on how microgravity influences the radiation susceptibility of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/nasa-discovers-massive-planet-bigger-than-earth-with-gas-tied-exclusively-to-living-organisms/" data-type="post" data-id="74921"&gt;living organisms&lt;/a&gt;, which could significantly impact the design of future deep-space missions. The data gathered could also be used to improve astronaut health management strategies, making long-term space travel safer and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the mice, more than &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt; are also part of the mission. Fruit flies are commonly used in biological experiments due to their relatively short life cycles and well-understood genetic makeup. Their inclusion in this mission provides another level of insight into how space conditions affect organisms at various levels of complexity. With multiple types of organisms being studied, the Bion-M No. 2 mission is expected to yield diverse and comprehensive data on the impact of spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Radiation in Long-Duration Space Missions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial elements of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 mission&lt;/strong&gt; is its focus on radiation. Space radiation is a major concern for long-duration space travel, as it can cause significant harm to living tissues and increase the risk of cancer. The Bion-M No. 2 spacecraft will be placed in a nearly circular orbit with an inclination of around 97 degrees, which will increase the level of cosmic radiation that the organisms are exposed to. This orbital position is specifically chosen to increase radiation exposure by at least an order of magnitude compared to previous missions like Bion-M No. 1. By studying the effects of this radiation on the mice and other specimens, the mission aims to better understand how space radiation influences biological systems and how to mitigate these risks for future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data gathered from this experiment will be critical for developing new technologies and strategies to protect astronauts from the harmful effects of radiation. Space agencies worldwide are keenly aware of the risks posed by space radiation, and the findings from this mission could pave the way for new innovations in space health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In a study published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, the Synthetic Biological Systems Lab shows how their system hides a virus inside a tumor-seeking bacterium, smuggles it past the immune system, and unleashes it inside cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new platform combines the bacteria's tendency to find and attack tumors with the virus's natural preference for infecting and killing cancerous cells. Tal Danino, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering, led the team's effort to create the system, which is called CAPPSID (short for Coordinated Activity of Prokaryote and Picornavirus for Safe Intracellular Delivery). Charles M. Rice, an expert in virology at The Rockefeller University, collaborated with the Columbia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We aimed to enhance bacterial cancer therapy by enabling the bacteria to deliver and activate a therapeutic virus directly inside tumor cells, while engineering safeguards to limit viral spread outside the tumor," says co-lead author Jonathan Pabón, an MD/PhD candidate at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that this technology -- validated in mice -- represents the first example of directly engineered cooperation between bacteria and cancer-targeting viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach combines the bacteria's instinct for homing in on tumors with a virus's knack for infecting and killing cancer cells. "By bridging bacterial engineering with synthetic virology, our goal is to open a path toward multi-organism therapies that can accomplish far more than any single microbe could achieve alone," says Zakary S. Singer, a co-lead author and former postdoctoral researcher in Tal Danino's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is probably our most technically advanced and novel platform to date," says Danino, who is also affiliated with the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Columbia's Data Science Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sneaking past the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles in oncolytic virus therapy is the body's own defense system. If a patient has antibodies against the virus -- from a prior infection or vaccination -- those antibodies can neutralize it before it reaches a tumor. The Columbia team sidestepped that problem by tucking the virus inside tumor-seeking bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The bacteria act as an invisibility cloak, hiding the virus from circulating antibodies, and ferrying the virus to where it is needed," Singer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pabón says this strategy is especially important for viruses that people are already exposed to in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our system demonstrates that bacteria can potentially be used to launch an oncolytic virus to treat solid tumors in patients who have developed immunity to these viruses," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting the tumor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system's bacterial half is &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/em&gt;, a species that naturally migrates to the low-oxygen, nutrient-rich environment inside tumors. Once there, the bacteria invade cancer cells and release the virus directly into the tumor's interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We programmed the bacteria to act as a Trojan horse by shuttling the viral RNA into tumors and then lyse themselves directly inside of cancer cells to release the viral genome, which could then spread between cancer cells," Singer says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exploiting the bacteria's tumor-homing instincts and the virus's ability to replicate inside cancer cells, the researchers created a delivery system that can penetrate the tumor and spread throughout it -- a challenge that has limited both bacteria- and virus-only approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safeguarding against runaway infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key concern with any live virus therapy is controlling its spread beyond the tumor. The team's system solved that problem with a molecular trick: making sure the virus couldn't spread without a molecule it can only get from the bacteria. Since the bacteria stay put in the tumor, this vital component (called a protease) isn't available anywhere else in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spreadable viral particles could only form in the vicinity of bacteria, which are needed to provide special machinery essential for viral maturation in the engineered virus, providing a synthetic dependence between microbes," Singer says. That safeguard adds a second layer of control: even if the virus escapes the tumor, it won't spread in healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is systems like these -- specifically oriented towards enhancing the safety of these living therapies -- that will be essential for translating these advances into the clinic," Singer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further research and clinical applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marks a significant step toward making this type of bacteria-virus system available for future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a physician-scientist, my goal is to bring living medicines into the clinic," Pabón says. "Efforts toward clinical translation are currently underway to translate our technology out of the lab."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danino, Rice, Singer, and Pabón have filed a patent application (WO2024254419A2) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office related to this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team is testing the approach in a wider range of cancers, using different tumor types, mouse models, viruses, and payloads, with an eye to developing a "toolkit" of viral therapies that can sense and respond to specific conditions inside a cell. They are also evaluating how this system can be combined with strains of bacteria that have already demonstrated safety in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqb3ct0012o3m6haruencg@published"&gt;Two years ago, I had a conversation with my doctor that remains one of the more unnerving interactions I have ever had. After reviewing the results of a routine blood test, she wanted to know if I had recently experienced any of the following: loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, or a seizure. No, no, no, and no. Then she wanted to know: Did I have an altered mental state? At that point, debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiog001z3b796m59o14w@published"&gt;It turned out I had too little sodium in my blood. As the doctor and I talked, the culprit became clear: My healthy lifestyle was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00203b79x2trp7xs@published"&gt;I run or go to the gym every day. I try to eat well. I drink plenty of water, especially when I’m working out.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00213b79fr9jjx5g@published"&gt;Bombarded by public health warnings about the dangers of not drinking enough, I was terrified of dehydration. Add in &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/04/decoder-ring-the-history-of-hydration"&gt;cultural myths&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/#:~:text=Rather%2C%20surveys%20of%20food%20and,and%20certainly%20not%20overtly%20ill."&gt;the 8x8 rule&lt;/a&gt;—eight glasses of 8 ounces of water a day—and lifestyle messaging that drinking more water will help me have better skin, hair, sleep, digestion, you name it, and I was knocking back at least 3 liters of water each day&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That was on top of my morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!), and any other drinks I happened to have. Yes, those things count toward water intake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00223b79wzvc9abe@published"&gt;Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00233b793vr0ujdn@published"&gt;And now I was in danger. In the body along with water is sodium—an essential electrolyte that helps your body maintain its fluid balance, preserves nerve and muscle function, and keeps your heart working, among other things. A healthy sodium level is anywhere between 135 and 145 millimoles per liter of blood. Sodium is naturally found in food, and people who eat a Western diet tend to add quite a bit extra to their meals in the form of table salt too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00243b79boc8hg1q@published"&gt;But the body’s delicate balance between water and salt can be rapidly thrown out of whack, especially during exercise. At one end of the spectrum is dehydration. At the other is overhydration and hyponatremia, a potentially life-threatening condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00253b79j0ri6zan@published"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when a person’s blood sodium levels drop below 135 millimoles per liter of blood. If someone drinks to excess, they effectively dilute their blood sodium levels. At the same time, water starts to leak into their body’s tissues, causing them to swell, explains &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamara-Hew-Butler"&gt;Tamara Hew-Butler&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based podiatrist who specializes in treating and studying runners. In severe cases, the brain can start to swell, leading to some of hyponatremia’s core symptoms: confusion, dizziness, the inability to speak properly, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00263b7923l55u4x@published"&gt;I was training for a half-marathon at the time that I was diagnosed with hyponatremia, and I was easily drinking 4 liters of water or sports drinks a day. My doctor was blunt: I was drinking too much and not replacing the salt I had lost in sweat. And while I didn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as if anything was wrong with me, if I didn’t change, I would be putting myself at risk of far worse than a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00273b79d00u54cu@published"&gt;“When the sodium level starts to creep downward, people are more likely to experience more severe symptoms,” said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/climateandhealth/about-us"&gt;Paul Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency medicine physician and an affiliate faculty member at the University of Colorado. A person can lose consciousness, have seizures, collapse, vomit, and fall into a coma. In extreme cases, the brain swells so much that the brain stem herniates—a rupture that is fatal. All of this can happen in the space of just a few hours. Multiple marathon runners and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/07/health/young-athletes-football-overhydration-partner"&gt;other athletes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450341/Marathon-victim-died-drinking-MUCH-water.html"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-14-na-briefs14.1-story.html"&gt;died of overhydration&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00283b79qhgc2pza@published"&gt;While some people can be at risk of low sodium because they take certain medications or have an underlying health problem, exercise-associated hyponatremia strikes otherwise healthy people. A lot of what we know about the condition comes from studying ultrarunners and other endurance athletes, as well as the military. There’s some evidence to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9699060/"&gt;suggest that women&lt;/a&gt; may be more at risk than men, and while it’s unclear why, hyponatremia tends to be more severe in smaller individuals purely because it’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20199991/"&gt;easier for them to overconsume&lt;/a&gt; fluids relative to their body mass, said &lt;a href="https://hhpr.uark.edu/directory/uid/brendonm/name/Brendon+P.+McDermott/"&gt;Brendon McDermott&lt;/a&gt;, a physiologist at the University of Arkansas and a seasoned marathoner.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00293b79j3hzs7ob@published"&gt;It is also unclear how many people may experience hyponatremia, in part because not everyone shows symptoms, Charlton said. Interestingly, some studies suggest that certain people may just be low in sodium all the time, while others suggest that some people might not be able to access their body’s sodium stores efficiently, tending them &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16344476/"&gt;toward hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi002a3b798cglf65m@published"&gt;What is abundantly clear, however, is that when people stop drinking to thirst and instead compel themselves to take in fluids while exercising, their physiology can rapidly spiral out of control. (Theoretically, you could also overhydrate while sitting in your car and throwing back Stanley cups full of water, but it would be exceedingly difficult.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002b3b79pjtxkfqa@published"&gt;During exercise, the descent into hyponatremia can be exacerbated in particular ways, Hew-Butler said, not least by sweating out salts. But there is a hormonal aspect too: Vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone, ramps up during exercise, and especially when it’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002c3b79w6yivswb@published"&gt;“Your body’s like, ‘Oh my God, I’m losing water. I’m not going to pee it out,’ ” Hew-Butler said. By suppressing the call of nature while you’re losing fluid through sweat, the body is trying to maintain that delicate water-to-salt ratio and keep everything working the way it should, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002d3b79vtmuvade@published"&gt;In other words, the body starts trying to retain fluid. Importantly, subbing out water for sports drinks is not going to cut it: “It functionally makes very little difference in terms of people’s outcome,” Charlton said. He and other experts I spoke to all agreed that most sports drinks should be treated as water. (For context, most commercial sports drinks contain around 10 percent of a person’s recommended daily sodium—a 20-ounce bottle of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, for example, has 270 milligrams, or about 11 percent, while a 12-ounce bottle of Powerade contains 240 milligrams of sodium, which is 10 percent.) So if you start chugging sports drinks or water midway through a run, then you can quickly swell your cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002e3b79jl7e68zd@published"&gt;“That’s why sometimes people get in more trouble during exercise,” Hew-Butler said. “They preload and they keep loading.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002f3b796so943mx@published"&gt;Confoundingly, hyponatremia’s early clinical presentation—dizziness, headache, confusion—appears almost exactly the same as that of dehydration or heat exhaustion. Hyponatremia can be confirmed only by a blood test, and while medical tents at large sports events and emergency rooms have the kit to be able to quickly ascertain people’s sodium levels, your average Jane—me!—might not realize the true nature of their problem. And that can make things worse, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002g3b797cemfdqz@published"&gt;In an increasing number of cases, Charlton said, people who don’t fit the typical mold for acute or exercise-associated hyponatremia are being diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002h3b79ix827job@published"&gt;If someone is out hiking or playing in a high school football game, or even just doing some gardening in hot weather, they might be tempted to drink a lot of water even if they aren’t thirsty in a bid to avoid dehydration or merely to cool down, he said, unwittingly endangering themself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002i3b79kwdqs2jn@published"&gt;Charlton recalled the case of a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39085067/"&gt;Japanese woman&lt;/a&gt; who was performing on an outdoor stage on a hot day. She collapsed and had a five-minute seizure after her act. It turned out that, worried about heat injury and following public health guidance to drink lots of water, she had drunk about 4 liters of liquid during her show. When staffers took her blood at the hospital, they learned that her sodium level was 117.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002j3b79akb2elia@published"&gt;“It was not clear at the beginning [that she had hyponatremia] because she did not fit their profile,” Charlton said. “She wasn’t an ultrarunner. She wasn’t engaged in regular high-stress activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002k3b79jvjtj9l7@published"&gt;She was simply trying to take care of herself. And doing that before you are thirsty can lead to trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002l3b79ztm4ocir@published"&gt;“You hear a lot about, like, thirst is inadequate, and if you get thirsty, it’s too late,” Hew-Butler said. “But thirst is a biological mechanism that’s been conserved for 700 million years,” she added. “It’s not defective when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002m3b79xofy7ex4@published"&gt;This resonated with me. I had always thought that if I felt thirsty during exercise, and especially in hot weather, then I was in trouble—dehydrated and at risk of heat exhaustion. I never once considered that I might not feel thirsty because I had drunk &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002n3b79f9up9tbn@published"&gt;It’s true that dehydration and heat exhaustion are more common than hyponatremia—a survey of active military personnel in 2024 found just &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591377/"&gt;134 cases of exertional hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;, while there were &lt;a href="https://www.health.mil/News/Articles/2025/06/01/MSMR-Heat-Illness-2025?type=Reports"&gt;471 cases of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; and 2,380 cases of heat exhaustion, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002o3b79t2oukfph@published"&gt;But McDermott, the University of Arkansas physiologist, noted that while dehydration alone is unlikely to kill you, if you develop hyponatremia and it goes unchecked, then it could rapidly be deadly in and of itself. “There should be education on hyponatremia, equal to dehydration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002p3b7985wdgtq2@published"&gt;He and other experts I spoke to for this story said that people taking part in sporting events should be issued guidance on overhydration, and that public health messaging must be clearer about the specific dangers of hyponatremia. Hew-Butler suggested that events like marathons should actually limit their water and sports drink stations to discourage overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002q3b79syvudr7o@published"&gt;Charlton argues that public health officials must be cognizant of hyponatremia when they make recommendations for dealing with hotter weather (something we’ll only have more and more of due to climate change). “Probably, as more people are experiencing heat with climate change, there is just going to be a different profile of person that we have to look at these issues in,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002r3b79btgqrgr5@published"&gt;If someone is suspected of having hyponatremia—a condition that is, again, tricky to diagnose—the first, best thing they can do is stop drinking water, Hew-Butler said. In my case, my doctor told me to drink no more than a liter of fluid—water, coffee, soda, whatever—for several days in order to bring my sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. As a person accustomed to drinking 3 or 4 liters a day, I found that cutting back was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002s3b79xnc75iap@published"&gt;More acute cases require more intervention: In some instances, doctors might inject a little very salty saline into a person’s blood to try to bring up their sodium levels. If the patient is able to swallow, they might make them drink a quarter cup of water containing four dissolved bouillon cubes—which honestly sounds not bad. What about salt supplements? There is mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/02/electrolyte-supplements-dont-prevent-illness-in-athletes.html"&gt;sodium supplements&lt;/a&gt; like salt tablets aren’t enough to prevent hyponatremia during intense exercise, although McDermott said they likely wouldn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002t3b79mpjevhhd@published"&gt;At the same time, there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/"&gt;no single recommended amount of water&lt;/a&gt; that everyone should drink while working out, Hew-Butler said. In fact, you can calculate how much fluid you lose while exercising by weighing yourself before and after an hour of your chosen activity. The difference indicates the water weight shed through sweat. Apart from that, she and the other experts I spoke to for this piece all had the same recommendations: Drink when you’re thirsty. Stop when you’re not. Eat salt. And if you find yourself craving salt on a long run, buy a bag of pretzels or chips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002u3b798oiky8ko@published"&gt;Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgion002v3b79edeiuzbw@published"&gt;And as Hew-Butler told me, hydration is “an experiment of one.” Another way to put it: We live in a world full of giant water bottles. We fetishize an easy health fix. But, particularly if you’re an athlete, listen to your own thirst cues and just say no to big &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;hydration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States alone, an estimated 178 million people are missing at least one tooth, which explains why dentures and titanium implants replacements are so common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentistry is now aiming for something better, a living replacement that feels and functions like the original. The idea is not science fiction anymore, and it is moving from animal studies toward carefully designed human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/pamela-yelick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pamela C. Yelick&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt; School of Dental Medicine leads one of the teams moving this vision toward the clinic. A recent study from her and colleague &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/weibo-zhang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weibo Zhang&lt;/a&gt; have pushed the conversation onto the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dentures-as-tooth-replacements"&gt;Dentures as tooth replacements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth loss is not rare, and the burden rises with age worldwide. About 7 percent of people 20 or older have complete tooth loss, and that figure reaches 23 percent for those 60 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern implants are anchored directly to the jaw through osseointegration, a concept that traces back to Per Ingvar Brånemark’s mid twentieth century work with titanium and bone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history matters because it explains why implants are stable, and also why they do not feel like natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural teeth are suspended in the socket by the periodontal ligament, which provides sensation and micro movement control that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-successfully-grow-human-teeth-in-a-laboratory-for-the-first-time/"&gt;implants&lt;/a&gt; lack. That difference shows up as reduced tactile sensitivity with implants compared with natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load also travels differently through an implant than through a tooth root cushioned by ligament fibers. Over time, that can contribute to bone loss around the fixture and biological complications that sometimes lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-routes-to-living-teeth"&gt;Two routes to living teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One route grows a replacement as a tissue, using a scaffold that guides cells to assemble into a tooth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent large animal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729491/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used decellularized tooth bud scaffolds seeded with human dental pulp cells, porcine dental epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then implanted these constructs into adult minipig jaws where they formed tooth like tissues including periodontal ligament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other route tries to spark tooth development in place by presenting the right developmental signals to adult cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120109/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; mapping the choreography of early human tooth formation are building a playbook that identifies the epithelial and mesenchymal cues needed to kick off organized growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-roots-and-ligaments"&gt;Tooth roots and ligaments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scaffold approach matters because the emerging structures were not inert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dental-pulp-stem-cells-from-extracted-wisdom-teeth-can-treat-multiple-diseases/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; supporting ligament and mineralized tissues in the socket and progressed over a period of months, which brings the approach closer to human scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even creating a tooth root that you could put an artificial crown on, with living dental pulp in the middle, secured by periodontal ligaments instead of being screwed into the jaw, could be a huge improvement to a person’s oral health and in turn, systemic health,” said Yelick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-helps-tooth-replacement"&gt;Protein helps tooth replacement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate line of work targets a specific protein, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7880588/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1&lt;/a&gt;, that suppresses tooth formation. Blocking USAG-1 in mice rescued missing teeth caused by different genetic problems, and the same strategy produced new incisors in ferrets, which share a human-like replacement pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, a single administration was enough to generate a whole tooth,” stated &lt;a href="https://toregem.co.jp/en/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katsu Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;, whose group &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research-news/2021-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the antibody treatment while at &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A humanized anti USAG-1 antibody has been advanced by industry collaborators, with investigators reporting that a phase 1 protocol has been finalized and preparations for future studies are underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That marks the shift from animal proof of concept to testing for safety, dosing, and early signals of activity in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing updates from partners indicate plans to run the first in human study and to prepare for subsequent pediatric trials if early results support it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial clinical focus is congenital tooth agenesis in young children, where a therapy that triggers tooth development could change lifelong care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-would-count-as-success"&gt;What would count as success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A living &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tooth-enamel-analysis-suggests-early-eurasians-were-multiple-species-paranthropus-robustus/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; would restore ligament mediated sensation, which helps people modulate bite force and detect grit or high spots. It would also reconnect to bone through tissues that are built to bear chewing loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those features could reduce pain and bone loss around a replacement compared with a rigid post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could also lengthen functional life compared with today’s devices, which often need repair or replacement after years of wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-cost-and-complexity"&gt;What about cost and complexity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell based therapies will only reach clinics if they can be produced reliably and priced within reach of today’s prosthetic options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing compatible epithelial cells at the right developmental stage is a known challenge, and that is why teams built their scaffolds around young pig tooth buds while they refine ways to recruit a patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work with induced pluripotent stem cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9065891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iPSC&lt;/a&gt;s) is also moving forward, including efforts to make enamel forming cells and repair enamel defects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As methods improve, the main questions will be safety, quality control, and whether costs can compete with implant dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-replacement-and-future-tech"&gt;Tooth replacement and future tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An atlas of human fetal tooth development now details epithelial subpopulations and their signaling to mesenchyme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That resource gives researchers the specific factors and timing likely needed to nudge adult cells toward making a new tooth unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those cues can be delivered precisely, either by a staged therapy in the jaw or by organoid-like constructs that finish maturing in the socket, dentists could one day replace a lost tooth with a living one that integrates, remodels, and feels like it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/article/14/2/szae076/7933795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Witnesses have photographed these hairless growths oozing pus covering most of the animals' bodies, from their heads and eyes to their legs, feet, and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some on social media have suspected that the animals are carrying squirrel pox, a rare virus in the US that mainly affects red squirrels, others have pointed out that the illness is more likely to be squirrel fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition is caused by a different virus, resulting in wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own, and is more common in US gray squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In either case, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may be unintentionally causing the virus to spread to more squirrels throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In November 2024, a Reddit user in the US posted an image of a squirrel covered in tumors consistent with squirrel fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis may look terrifying, but it's a common skin disease among gray squirrels in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's caused by the leporipoxvirus and is spread through direct contact between healthy squirrels and the lesions or saliva of infected squirrels, similar to herpes transmission in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes hairless growths or tumors, which can break open and leak clear fluid just like an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the virus cannot spread to humans or other animals such as dogs or birds, Webb said people should not touch or attempt to help infected squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would not recommend trying to capture a squirrel that has the virus,' Webb told the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/05/15/homestead/squirrel-pox-maine-joam40zk0w/"&gt;Bangor Daily News&lt;/a&gt;. 'It is naturally occurring and will run its course in time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To Webb's point, while the growths can look alarming, they typically heal without the need for medication and are rarely fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some severe cases of squirrel fibromatosis may affect the animal's internal organs and lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sightings of infected squirrels date back to the summer of 2023, the most recent cases were posted online less than a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cases are not believed to be squirrel pox, which generally infects red squirrels and is more common in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I thought it was eating something from my front beds, but then I realized it was on its face,' one Reddit user posted on July 31 after spotting a gray squirrel with a large tumor on its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildlife officials noted that sightings tend to rise during the summer when more animals are out gathering food, especially from homes that put out bird feeders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like a lot of people, I love watching birds,' Webb said. 'Unfortunately, you can attract multiple [squirrels] to that feeder and risk exposure if one has the virus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained that squirrels with fibromatosis can leave their saliva on uneaten bird seed at these feeders, which healthy animals can then ingest and contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To this point, wildlife experts have not confirmed whether the new sightings are cases of fibromatosis or squirrel pox (SQPV), but there's less of a chance that squirrel pox is spreading through the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SQPV is a systemic condition that often results in death among red squirrels, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Moreover, SQPV is more common in the UK, as there are more red squirrels in that country compared to the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fibromatosis tumors typically heal on their own within 2 months and do not return among gray squirrels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A similar condition affecting rabbits in the Midwest has prompted many on social media to ask if it would be humane to euthanize animals spotted with these tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like the rabbits infected with cottontail papilloma virus, causing tentacle-like tumors on their heads, wildlife officials have said that people should leave squirrels with fibromatosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A squirrel's immune system can clear the virus within four to eight weeks, although it may take longer for larger or secondary infections to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition does not typically come back once a squirrel contracts fibromatosis, and gray squirrels generally recover fully, meaning the horrifying growths won't be visible by the time people see that same animal next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOclNQbXI1ZHBObUxkc1NVTFBtSkZQSjJMMHQ2OVJLY2RBQ2hfRE00NDBQblFUMGJmbmw5WFR1azlLRXlINnppQmpxQkdpT3ZwWDhKM1Azc2cyX1hiTEc3Z21xYXdYbzhLYlNET2RoaG5PXzMzTk5BZ3poRnVNeUQ0R2NTODVxSTBERkZ1cktONzV5ZzNoX29UN3BKN25Mek5vejNfZ2NB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE5QZ0ZHTW5GWVpsVVF2QkNrWllnd0wxdi02dmVRcW5uMXFXWTBFTmdwMnhfdlZVc3pKNzgwTzluQ3A4c0N2eERmaVVUcjFaZTJlRV9uWnpJalhheTlEMTQxTENra3BfMFFqSlM0R0NOZzI1Y012RlhtcDQxYnBzUVNPY0ptNzB2MDZ1dWRlS0RqRFVTOHQ4UFN0NXlTY1hkZEt3ZTBfTDhqbzBoMA</guid></item><item><title>什么是“Ozempic vulva” ，因为女性分享了鲜为人知的副作用- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQbWlsSjhoamJXZU1ScmdEdHMzZE0tOWxiRmJLR0tNWWVybGZNWFRnN2UyZExnLWt6ZzJhYmdibVdQaVktRG9pNnJzT2JsN2FSWncxbktKZTBad3BnaEhMVi1KRWtXbld3U3U0OXQ1RTRiTDY5Y091a2djTG1IamtNRTlReUkySV90bHJCRk95QkxKUEZsMXNETW5UUDE4aFN5clJaWHJHMEF0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts have weighed in on 'Ozempic vulva', as women share their experience of the little-known side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist medications such as &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, Wegovy and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mounjaro"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;

Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what’s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e45a8e" class="body-graf"&gt;The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cdc-warns-increased-dengue-fever-risk-us-rcna158851" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquito-viruses-are-spreading-know-west-nile-eee-rcna168653" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7e8be" class="body-graf"&gt;It's also caught people off guard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f244" class="body-graf"&gt;“People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31b6ef" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'A ticking time bomb'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60c42" class="body-graf"&gt;The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquitoes-carry-west-nile-are-becoming-resistant-insecticides-cdc-say-rcna96867" target="_blank"&gt;becoming resistant to insecticides&lt;/a&gt;, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ad6d4" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8afc4" class="body-graf"&gt;She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57f600" class="body-graf"&gt;“In Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,” Messenger said. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bc9b6" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, &lt;a href="https://media.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/download/mosquito-control/weekly-updates/2025/20250811-arbo-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Southern Nevada Health District&lt;/a&gt;, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/las-vegas-mosquitoes-carrying-west-nile-virus-record-rcna157818" target="_blank"&gt;record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4f998" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, the public health department hasn’t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it’s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a334a" class="body-graf"&gt;“We see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,” she said. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7263f4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District has been &lt;a href="https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/programs/mosquito-surveillance/" target="_blank"&gt;conducting mosquito surveillance in the region&lt;/a&gt; since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d41c2" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31df0d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 'relentless biters' are spreading &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3dbf" class="body-graf"&gt;“In 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,” said Raman, who oversees the health district’s mosquito surveillance program. “A few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcbb13" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbcecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“Aedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,” Raman said. “They are just relentless biters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a88839" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad2c51" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. “All it takes is a couple inches of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838f64" class="body-graf"&gt;Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11040e" class="body-graf"&gt;Climate change is likely also a factor, and it’s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-mosquitos-tropical-disease-rcna149366" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-869c2b" class="body-graf"&gt;In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e59d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Las Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,” Messenger said. “We’re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we’re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b562f1" class="body-graf"&gt;What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1370f2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city — and thus controlling the public health risk — will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn’t one in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a6c88" class="body-graf"&gt;“You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-313aa3" class="body-graf"&gt;That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use — particularly around humans — and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e04f" class="body-graf"&gt;In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2506f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,” she said. “Nobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQY1ltWVQzYWU1MFREb3I3ZTRqZ3BzdVlFWS1Qb0hhU0lpZW9oQm5xRUZGcjgzQ1JNVTZSRzlmRXZDV0hfZWtmM2NZNlJ0akU1TlJmNlNHcnREdXk3WEczZ0dFQjNyc3gzMjBDRkZhUWYxNkRzV0YwM2l5N2QtQW5GZ05ZTHV0ck1FTmp6UE5oOFBzeVdqNlg40gFWQVVfeXFMTlVCN0FOVlBVcV9kNnFkdHh6UGVoMC1tOU1ZLU5RZ3RYdGp1ZElETU1WeW5haFRkaDR4cmdhNUxIWnJRRGprTFo1RjhjNjJSV2pYVVpra1E</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的营养学家建议在验血前停止服用这种维生素补充剂；原因如下-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While social media can be a global stage for a lot of unexpected nuisances, it also provides a platform for information sharing between professionals and people about topics that need more attention than they are getting at the moment. One such issue is a lack of knowledge about a vitamin supplement that can interfere with blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in a video going viral on the internet Dr. Amy Shah, an MD &amp;amp; Nutrition Expert, trained at Cornell, Harvard, Einstein and Columbia shared the name of a vitamin that can hamper blood tests. Her video has received about 2K likes and 84 comments, with more and more people appreciating her putting the information out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don’t know why we don’t talk about this enough. It’s really a nuisance at best and dangerous at worse. I don’t think most people know this and it’s such a common supplement/ingredient in supplements," wrote Shah in the caption of the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is such a PSA especially for all of my girlfriends because you know what? Everyone that I know is taking a hair, skin and nail supplement and a lot of them, most of them have high doses of biotin and you have to know that biotin interferes with blood testing for heart attacks like with troponin levels, with thyroid testing, with reproductive hormone testing, with parathyroid testing," said the doctor in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, imagine this, you're having chest pain, you go to the ER and they're like oh my god, you're having a heart attack because your troponin levels are elevated. But you failed to tell them that you've been taking high dose of biotin and that is the reason why the troponin was high," she explained further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So not only are we confused, we get excess blood testing, we might not diagnose it correctly. That's why I want you to know that if you are taking these things, definitely stop them before you get your blood testing about 72 hours, and if you end up in the hospital for whatever reason, let them know that you've been taking biotin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is this true?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

According to a study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5951654/#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20many,to%20unnecessary%20procedures%20and%20treatments." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, many common blood tests employ a biotin-streptavidin reaction as a part of the test procedure. While the amount of dietary biotin intake is not expected to affect these tests, biotin supplementation at doses greater than 1 mg per day can cause either falsely low or falsely high test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly dangerous for patients in emergency situations who are not aware that they are taking high doses of biotin or when the physician doesn't know that the patient is doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Interactions%20with%20Laboratory%20Tests,-Very%20high%20intakes&amp;amp;text=Even%20a%20single%2010%20mg,of%20the%20patient%20%5B32%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even a single 10 mg dose of biotin has interfered with thyroid function tests administered within 24 hours of taking the supplement. Additionally, according to the FDA a patient with a high intake of supplemental biotin died following a troponin test that gave a falsely low result because the test was subject to biotin interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Dr Shah advised if you are taking biotin supplements it is better to avoid them before blood tests and inform your physician about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAJBVV95cUxNOEI3dW80LV9LckRJT1hvUTRndTBCYUJCYjB6N0pQTl9JamZZV1ZVNUxUeFZqODJyOE12b1FTRDVvOHEySzVvVE5PYUkwdExGYnJEN1pqQUFvYjdpaFVIMVEyOHQ3bFJOeUFMQjJGZkRiY08tNHF2eUtxSzFRVVh3ZXFVYUVnM3NfUmVlRzAzMndLYms3Y2VDb0FvYTRlUndtZGdNWUJEaU5wTmVDR21KT3MtazAxdWx0YjFVLVhEWWtTZGJvUktsUlpWcnczaVB4dWlmZXZpaFhMeTVpUzJ1SmUyZUxrUjBxb0VYU1R4RGdJYWx5LVB5S3VLTE4xSFdGZmd4TTdJZ1pORVp1RnJPQWhUTm5QMXpqWVh5bTNpYjZFQWVV0gGqAkFVX3lxTE5aYmtGU0tmcEdwVjZvRzRTbkxiTDdub1Fqdzk0LXN6U0N1VzEwYlhOeVgyWlJtU1FLZGhZQW5GQlBJd1JxQUVvMi1pSV9PSFNkUFJLektfT0MteXBoQjkwUml2emFWWm5vbDFoeEUwQXhIM3J4alZObWhCeDU0dUZwQkpiRnpXSXZ2QTdzUkVyemtVWXp0UF9FTUFBb2JHc3B3SzliTTdSeVMybV9yX2RCZ0ZadkZmVGVKazFVNUdBUmRZbzNqWjFDRXNLX1diVllFc3Zad3R5N19CWGJuMWNQQmh3VmVpYmFDR1UydmM1NGpZR2k1Q0x3Vl8yeXlvWlRyZGwtN3dGYVJDS2dZaUVUek96dGVlSEpjaXZhcWp2TkdRRTZkUHlIUGc</guid></item></channel></rss>
